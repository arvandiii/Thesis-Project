[[mosswood dreadknight]] this card gave me chills at last week tournaments. i've played 4 copies of it and it worked nicely. each removal gave me a chance to draw and knight was great magnet for removal and counterspells. also attacking with him in turns 4+ was great way to reducing boardstate of enemy. if knight was blocked often took something with it and could get back in the same turn or next one. also this card was great blocker for jund decks. where i can often trade 1 for 1 but my knight could get back quickly. i reduced him because 4 feels kinda high because almost every time you have chance to send it from grave to adventure, and last week i ended with two of them on adventure and two on board. [[call of the ring]] this card i've added almost at spot when the lotr showed up. since then i've played with at least two copies of it in deck. cut it for two weeks of playing to test some other things and i have a lot of respect t this card. i must say this card works great, but begin with some disadvantages of it. triggering with creature on board can be problematic in some matchups but if.you have bowmasters or grist in main deck this card can be insane. also 2 life of cost can be harsh, because if you have played with [[dark confidant]] you get some cards for free or for 1 life, there cost is fixed and this could be painful. but there are huge advantages from this card which makes me to keep copies of it in deck. the may in ability is huge advantage cause you can control when you draw. bob is great but his mandatory trigger caused too much deaths grinning_face_with_sweat . also whole ring tempts you mechanic makes huge additional value for this deck. ring token attached to bowmaster or even better elvish reclaimer is huge pain in ass for op. if you can grow reclaimer in dmg step and it have ring token you can hit for 7 and draw card. this or ring on bowmaster or haywire gave me so much value in pre woe modern that when on last week tournament played without call of the ring it was kinda sad and i lacked additional value that card made. proceeding to matchups. worth to mention i'm playing mostly at local tournaments and local groups, and also im not so pro player and i made huge amount of mistakes, or bad decisions. so when i play this deck i have no feeling that im off meta and i'm so much worse than meta decks. often i could go head to head with meta decks and give them so much threat that they have to struggle to win with me. lets begin with match ups i find the hardest. 4c omnath - localy there is some amount of this decks. often they vary from what you can see on goldfish. generally this match up is 50/50 from the start, but most of the cases i feel that i need to fit the role of beatdown and force ton of dmg before the omnath comes. but set of tools can help me to delay of omnath. 4c is so much flexible and versitale that it can stomp gb rock, evoke elementals hurt so much, solitude gives hard times because of its exile. after sideboarding i fall to 4c cause they are ready to aggresssion. also i think that i need some better ideas to side against this match ups - i will gladly hear your advices. i often side in some tear asunder and go for throat against them to have chance to remove some threats that are fatal push proof. scam, i hate this deck smiling_face_with_tear grinning_face_with_sweat . i'm amazed how this deck is stubborn in the way of winning and how easliy it can achieve this. playing against scam is kinda lottery. grief is lesser threat in this cause if you get grief scammed you have plenty of time to draw enough of responds and creatures to get back to the game shortly. fury is huge threat imo. this card is push proof and if fury comes t1 you are lacking time to draw enough of responds to stop them. the worst case is when you are on draw and opponent plays t1 fury. they at least have one connection or you need to sacrifice reclaimer to gain time for removal. playing matchups against scam is kinda funny cause they will get you fast, like t3. or they will fall greatly to you and they are trying to hold the line to the golem and goyf aggresssion. hammer - kinda easy match ups (and yet last week i lost aginst it grinning_face_with_sweat ) from the beggining rock is equipped to deal with much of every threat hammer provides. often i feel that taking it slow with hammer gives more stable game for rock than trying to play early goyf and force dmg. siding against it is kinda easy haywire mite and tear asunder makes them weep, pithing needle played at right moment makes the scoop beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes . tron(s) kinda wierd matchups cause green tron is full of things that can make me cry but often falls short to early aggro. prison tron is kinda awkward cause you can easly get around of it but redundacy of this whole idea makes it hard for me to win longer games. also playing against tron is so rare recently that i dont make any decent sideboard against it. jund and jund sagavan, this match up is essence of magic for me. so much trades so much planing and distrupting. love this match ups. often this match ups are won by person who is more lucky to draw this crucial saga/goyf from top deck first. played against this jund with ring and sheoldred and im amazed how easly i could get rid of this threat and proceed to fight with board state. i feel that ring is not so much of threat for rock cause you can easly get rid of it. and sheoldred alone is not so much threat. monke is kinda weak against rock cause of bowmasters and fatal pushes. murktide, game against it is not so hard but not easy. you can easly get of early threat of murk and control their grave. but in other way rock can easly fall for counters and good responds of murk. fired [[dragon rage channeler]] is pain for rock cause of his flying. i feel there is lack of good creatures with reach. basic for this match is to side in some removal like go for throat, cause this gaves you chance to get rid of some early [[murktide regent]] rhinos, there is some eqality in this match up. they need to fire up twice in short time to be real threat for you, and you need to get there big goyf early to disturb their aggresssion. also hand hate in turn 1 gives you huge advantage against this deck. but their subtlety or [[force of negation]] can ruin plans of easy way. the best thing is that when rhinos were widly runing on local meta i throw [[ratchet bomb]] s instead of grist and sneaked it to the board making easier to wipe that fat tokens. okay that will be all, i hope for some nice advices what i can throw or test in this grinning_face_with_sweat grinning_face_with_sweat ",ModernMagic,school of gb rock,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/16snyiu/school_of_gb_rock/,0

to me now across the sweating fog and with a shiver, i am with her. before now, there was a warm electric night in august, and she’d looked like pretty trouble lighting her last cigarette at the foot of a street lamp. she was quitting this time for good. she said it from the corner of her mouth and her invisible words were followed by a curl of smoke. it always seemed odd to me to celebrate an end with another quick beginning, but maybe i didn’t know the implacable nag of comfort as she did. the times that we had broken up before, she’d always come back, wordless and tearful and desperately affectionate and hopeful eyed. and foolish or loving, i’d never turned her away. so maybe my comfort was just different from hers. she savored hers in a breath and i, a touch. i held her hand as we walked in that loose fingered way that pretends at cool composure. writhing blue plumes followed her from her other hand, mixing with the boudoir halos of sodium lights that led us in their curving procession toward the river. “do you think we’ll ever be this young again?” she asked. an odd question, but not for her. “in another life perhaps.” i said, staring straight ahead, watching our shadows. i had found love in those shadows once, stretching out onto the flat cobblestones of a nearly vacant city square where we’d eventually ended up dancing. i’d been humming (or maybe she) and a street lamp stood at our backs and made us great gray giants in the space beyond. i’d watched her shadow tilt and rest its head on my shadow's shoulder. i’d felt her hair pooling, spilling down my back. this time, our shadows slinked across the pavement toward somewhere hungry and accursed. “we should change streets.” “why? oh—“ she chuckled “you’re not actually afraid of a bridge are you?” there was a chiding smile in her voice. i slowed my stride, tried to tug her back without answering. but she was right to laugh. it was superstition. a statistical oddity that made the porter’s island bridge “the suicide bridge.” it wasn’t astoundingly high, but the water below was shallow and the rocks were plentiful and the legend of weeping maria tended to keep the bridge lonely at night. cars passed quickly and rarely was there ever anyone to talk a person away from the railing. that was all there was to it—a self-affirming urban legend. still, as the tower and cables of the bridge loomed ahead, i felt the dread of a place where so many people had stood and watched the grand expanse of night sky and dropped to their deaths. i watched them in my mind, one by one, faceless human shapes plummeting through the wide lightless air. they always jumped at night. she stopped thirty feet onto the bridge and folded her arms over the railing. the river whispered its labored gurgle below and she sighed. “it’s pretty here.” “it is.” “i wonder if weeping maria really lost the ring or if she threw it.” “it’s just a story.” my words came out half statement, half question. “yeah, but it’s a better story if she’s complicated instead of clumsy.” i gazed at her and her smallish smile. she looked like all there was in the world with the distant black mass of porter’s island behind. i wanted to be close to her, but i didn’t dare lean as she did to watch the moon licked strip of water below. i compromised with a pair of hands on the railing and braced against the emptiness beyond the cold length of metal. the rail could have been as wide as my leg and felt no more substantial. “maybe she did throw it away.” i paused. “but if she did then she’s evil, isn’t she?” she didn’t answer me. the story of weeping maria was a simple one—a blocky gem cut into facets by many different tellings. she was, by most accounts, a lovely young immigrant girl from mexico or guatemala or some other place south. a beggar, a flamenco prodigy, an apple picker’s daughter, the child of a nun who had become pregnant and, disgraced, found her way to a brothel—the details of maria’s youngest years were varied. ever consistent was the man. a handsome and wealthy and nameless rancher’s son had fallen madly in love with maria. he proposed with a diamond ring worth more than everything maria owned or would ever own. then on the old stone bridge that had spanned the river where the modern one now stood, she lost the ring to the water. some said that the diamond was so big, that in the shallow water she could still see it, soaked in moonlight and glinting from the bed of a wide gray stone. she leaned, reaching, full of hope and sorrow. then she had leaned too far. years later it was said that her ghost walked the bridge on quiet nights. she would appear behind a person walking or standing by the rail, and with a voice like honey she would ask the person to get her ring. they would always oblige her. but being a girl born from poverty, where a good pair of shoes was something to covet, she would implore the person to remove theirs lest they get ruined by the river. whether it was more folklore or not, those that jumped allegedly always left a pair of shoes behind, standing side by side, toes pointing off into oblivion. if maria had thrown the ring, then asking people to fetch it wasn’t an act of sorrow—regret perhaps—but perhaps something unknowable and sinister. “it’s probably a good time to go back,” i said, rubbing a circle into a bare patch of back between green spaghetti straps. “there are other pretty things in this town, some of them close to bartenders and food.” she had long since finished her cigarette and now twisted the filter between her fingers. “fair enough.” she began to stand, then froze. “look.” a man was walking the bridge two hundred feet or so away. he had come from the porter’s island side, staring directly at us. he was mumbling something unintelligible, rocking slightly back and forth. “he’s drunk,” i said. she watched without acknowledging. then the man buckled at the knees, folded into a shadow of his own making, whined loudly, pitifully. he made me uneasy and at once, i realized how alone and isolated we were. his screech startled me, raised the hairs on my arms and neck. if he wasn’t drunk, if he was mentally unstable, he might see a pair of strangers as something threatening. “we should go. we can tell someone to get the guy some help.” “i don’t—“ she trailed off. took a slow step toward him. “hey. i think going over is a bad idea.” “see.” “what?” “…pero…” i felt a sudden jab of dread, cold and dank and suffusing my middle. i grabbed her wrist and felt my clammy hands slide against her warm skin as she took another step. the man stood slowly, shaking, peering through space at us and at nothing. i was so focused on his face that i didn’t notice right away what had changed about him. a small thing, a loss—*his shoes*. had i had any strong thought, i might have said something entirely useless, but the man’s wail filled what room i had for words. “lo siento mucho, mi amor!” *i’m so sorry, my love!* i felt urgency in the pull of her wrist. my dread swelled. the man sidled over the rail, looked behind him, fell. there wasn’t so much a splash, but a wet crack and then the hush of the river cutting through the dark. —— the day after, i sat in a cafe and ignored the bustle and sipped a coffee that had stained my mouth with bitter char. a touch of sugar made it cloying. she moved a poached egg yolk around with a fork until finally it burst and bled into the hollow of her plate. she looked frail, sleepless, and her fresh pack of cigarettes was already missing four. “so you really don’t remember? you were staring. pulling away from me.” she winced. “no. i don’t remember him jumping—i don’t remember him at all. i remember feeling good—great really—like the world of you and us and the night and the city were all part of some riddle that i had solved.” she groaned miserably and put down her fork. “now i just feel this throb of regret or embarrassment or something in me and i don’t know what it’s from, but it’s there.” “i wanna help.” “you saw a guy die. you actually remember it. so i feel like i should be helping—ugh, lo siento, i thought i wanted these eggs, but i can’t.” the dread tickled. “you just did it again.” “what? oh fuck—the spanish? what did i—“. she pushed away her plate and folded down onto the table. “jesus. is there something wrong with me? ptsd or something?” “i don’t know.” i reached out a hand for her arm. she brushed her fingertips along my knuckles and spoke sideways into the table top. “you know, i don’t think i’ve ever loved you more than last night. i remember that. i remember leaning and feeling weightless and naughty and so fucking full of this, like, separate, inexhaustible well of happiness. and then you were pale and grabbing me. i thought you’d gone crazy.” she sighed and deflated a little more. “i guess i had.” —— she withered and she bloomed for three long days. *lo siento*. *no entiendes*. *perdóname por favor*. her little spanish interjections became more fraught. peppered into conversations then uttered alone in quiet moments through clenched teeth. she remembered none of them. she’d awake, clawing up the bed sheets, sweating and searching the darkness wildly—“lo siento!”—heaving in breaths before falling back onto the pillow, still for another hour or two or three. at times she seemed to rebound, bright and affectionate, staring luridly at me as i made toast or played on my phone. her gaze then was like something borrowed from a blushing moment in a sultry story—a look that was only mostly her. *jódeme como esta noche es el final de nosotros.* she would grasp and suck my tongue and still remembered only rags of what she’d done. five days after the bridge, she was scheduled to have a meeting with a therapist. she hadn’t been to one in years and for the most part, that had been okay. but she had never been so frayed in the time that i’d known her. she paced our small apartment fitfully and neglected the plants she loved and pounced on me with unreserved passion that felt increasingly more like desperation. she tried again and again to explain. perhaps she thought i needed her to if i was going to see her as normal. or perhaps she needed to for her. “there’s—there’s an itch i can’t fucking scratch. a question i’m expected to answer, but i don’t know the question and maybe i never did—am i making sense?” she sat at our coffee table where we ate our dinners and she flipped her pack of cigarettes over and over again. she hadn’t opened it, hadn’t smoked all day, but perpetually seemed just on the verge. “i don’t understand what you’re going through, but yes, you’re making sense, i think.” “christ. half the time i’m not even sure if i’m speaking english. i don’t know some of the phrases i’ve said. how does that work? jódeme?—*fuck me*? i didn’t learn that in school. i mean, what the fuck.” “i don’t know. and it is weird, undoubtedly. but in two days, you’ll talk to a doctor who might be able to explain something. right?” “yeah. maybe.” she stared at the tumbling pack, moving, static. her fingers repeated the motion. “it’s like quitting kinda. feeling an urge to eat or drink but nothing feels right. you forget sometimes that you’re craving a cigarette. the solution is simple and it makes you crazy because there’s the urge and there’s you trying to be healthy.” *flip. flip. flip*. “i want you to fuck me. i don’t, but i do, and you’re going to because i don’t know what my cigarette solution is. okay?” —— that night, she fell asleep quickly and i watched her for a while. none of her fret ever seemed to invade her sleep until she’d startle awake. her face was warm peace, and she hadn’t smoked all day and she hadn’t celebrated a thing about it. this time, i was the one who woke, not to frantic spanish apologies, but to a clock that read 2:09 am. i turned over in bed and found myself alone. her phone sat on her bedside table, her pack of cigarettes. the bathroom door was open, the front door unlocked, her car sat quietly on the street outside our apartment. i don’t know how many directions i chose or how many blocks i walked or how many stumbling drunks i passed leaving the shuttered bars. i just know that the street lamps began to curve and felt a familiar knot twisting into me. i followed the road into silence and the slow rise of cables and towers. the silhouette of porter’s island looked desolate. the bridge looked desolate. and a few hundred feet from where it left the land, i stopped. my dread had worn me for days, my helplessness and confusion, and all at once it poured from me and pooled against the railing—around a pair of shoes i knew too well. hers. it was easier to collapse than to peer over the side, easier to weep than to squint impossibly through the darkness to find her broken body. i knew she was there. i didn’t need to see a thing. i held her shoes to my chest and slumped against the railing of the suicide bridge and tried to be numb. i almost succeeded for a second or two. “ella era una puta.” the voice cut a gouge through my nerves. i had been alone. i *was* alone. “ella era tu familia.” my words cut just as deeply. i hadn’t thought them—*she was your family*? whose family? “eras mi familia. mi prometido. tu *me* elegiste.” *you were my family. my betrothed. you chose **me***. i searched around me. nothing. no one. just a voice, a woman’s sob, and the sudden shock of ice upon my neck. another shock fell, a crawling rivulet, another after—stinging horrid pin pricks. tears. *maria*. “lo sien—“ i halfted, tried to summon any words of my own and gagged on the effort. silence was worse, clawing my throat raw as my lungs labored against my tightening ribs. “lo siento mucho, mi amor.” *no*. it’s what the man had said. before he jumped. *i’m so sorry, my love.* i staggered away, rose to my feet and fell back down again as i ambled toward the street. then i was running, sprinting away toward solid ground, heart pounding as i tried to shake away the chill of those tears. i turned only once, and there on the bridge, wrapped in the haze of a street lamp and a blanket of fog, was a woman standing alone who hadn’t been there and always had. she held something small—i saw it glint in the sallow light as it flew from her hand, down and down and down. *lo siento, mi maria*… she shrieked. anguish and heartache and rage—a keening, icy sound that rolled across the mist and rattled in my skull. then she took a step forward, lifted the fluted cloth of a skirt, threw a leg over the railing. my heart strained for…*her*—for a love i didn’t know. a perversion of the love i’d lost. her other leg followed, and for five of my breaths, she stared through the depths of the air down into the shallows of the river. she didn’t make a sound as she fell. silence as i turned away, shaking, terrified and broken by it all. and for the long walk home, i wept for the wrong woman. that was two nights ago. —— the next morning they dragged a scattered body from the rocks, the second in a week. a jane doe. she’d spoken of quitting cigarettes, of hungering and thirsting insatiably for a phantom comfort. she felt crazy for it and i think i know why. she was raging lust and hobbling torment in the end. passion and guilt. *ella era una puta.* a whore. restlessly, i dreamt of a girl without a ring, smiling flirtatiously for a man who had given one to his love. the girl wasn’t as pretty as the man’s new fiancée, but she made the man sweat. her sensual lips that parted and pursed and curled at the corners, her messy curls that lapped her nearly naked back. he had snuck the girl into his bed while his maria perused the market, while she strode past florists and fruit sellers and cheap bars full of leering and laughing men. maria’s life had been color—the coral pink of his favorite dress, the fire of a diamond, the ink of the night. and then it was only red—a pair of heels that weren’t hers, standing in his foyer, side by side. she climbed the stairs, listened to a woman’s giggle, a woman’s moan, she opened the bedroom door and the girl clawed up the bedsheets to hide her guilt. “no entiendes!” maria understood perfectly well. “perdóname! por favor!” forgive her? how? when the *puta* was *famillia*. maria had a *sister*. i know that now with certainty. i feel the truth of it. and i think in some way, the woman i loved became that sister. the lust remained and the torment remained, haunting her mind, but she couldn’t remember the rest. i wish i had it so easy. i remember too much. of my own life and of maria’s but i am missing parts too. she—the woman i loved for years—i can’t remember her name. she is maria in my phone now, on her socials, in my memories, but i know she wasn’t a maria because i know the face i see in the pictures isn’t hers either. that face i have only seen for a moment as it screamed atop a bridge, nightly in the haze of my dreams, and now, in the windows of my hollowed apartment. she watches from the other side of the glass, weeping, impatient, angrily tapping the sound of footsteps into my mind. she wants me to come with her. to the river. to the bridge. and there are times when i want to. i feel the misplaced guilt of another man’s betrayal and i know the penance i must make. there are other times when i am filled with fear. i don’t want to die. but i lose more and more of my life and my love with each passing day. this morning i awoke with my hand on my front door. maria wept giddily through the peephole. and the only thing i could think to utter was: [lo siento mucho, mi amor](",nosleep,"if you meet her on the suicide bridge, i’m so

[in today's issue: a new alliance? eire making moves! and a sad day :\(]( **building a better tomorrow** *a new age of amicitian foreign affairs dawns* the lux capital | on wednesday, it was announced that the kingdom of amicitia had officially become a member of the b.u.i.l.d. alliance. the b.u.i.l.d. alliance is a multi-national diplomatic initiative started back in july by mount augusta, the imperial federation, and the fempire union. since then, the alliance has grown to include the nations of arsenia and new jersey. rumors had been circulating for some time in regard to amicitia's admittance into the alliance. this speculation was sparked by observations from *sapphire wave* correspondents of increased meetings between amicitia's diplomat jjonthan and mount augusta's diplomat comradenick. in addition to this, jjonthan was reported to have made two separate trips to other b.u.i.l.d. nations; one to meet with king jalhf in the imperial federation and another with chairman jindosh in the fempire union. amicitia's joining of b.u.i.l.d. comes at an interesting time for civmc's global politics. many amicitians are curious as to how this will impact their nation's presence in the wider world. overall, it seems that most amicitians are hopeful when it comes to amicitia's role in b.u.i.l.d. though others, particularly amicitian traditionalists, have shown quite the degree of skepticism in seeing their beloved kingdom join such a large-scale multi-national alliance. [photo taken by a sapphire wave correspondent in mt. augusta of comradenick and jjonthan speaking with each other.]( here's what jjonthan had to say in an official statement earlier today: >we have, no doubt, entered a new stage in amicitian foreign policy. rest assured, this is not something we have entered into lightly. > >the b.u.i.l.d. alliance leaders have all shown themselves to be supportive of and helpful to our kingdom's national goal of diplomacy, culture, and friendship. it is the belief of myself, the king, and our prime minister that this alliance will help those goals be fulfilled not just in amicitia but in our fellow b.u.i.l.d. nations, too. > >global politics is a tricky thing. and it's not uncommon for tensions to arise when many different interests are at play. we recognize this as an inevitability. we don't seek to eliminate tension entirely (as strange as that might sound). instead, in tense situations, we seek a healthy tension- to seek an understanding of all viewpoints, and to uphold a respect for the dignity of all nations even if we find ourselves on separate ends of an issue. > >i think that's what this server needs. especially in tough times such as this. a little bit of positivity and understanding. it's not an easy thing, but that which is worth it never really is easy to do. > >peace is always possible. does our diplomat show a blind idealism? or a noble creed to build amicitian foreign policy off of? the kingdom's continued presence on the global stage shall surely show this. ==================================================================================== **the sounds of b.u.i.l.d. - song recommendations from b.u.i.l.d. alliance representatives** *to commemorate amicitia's joining of b.u.i.l.d., this issue's recommendation column will feature suggestions from different leaders in the alliance.* king jahlf (the imperial federation) - ""tuck everlasting"" by action/adventurethis song describes the feeling of getting too sucked into nostalgia and idealizing the past while not feeling like you can enjoy the present fully. i enjoy a lot of pop-punk and tend to be pretty nostalgic, so i very much vibe with this. i also love listening to smaller bands and unfortunately missed seeing them in concert recently, so this song has made it into my rotation again. altelier (new jersey) - ""telekinesis"" by travis scott (feat. sza & future)sza's vocals are really pretty. kanye west definitely worked on the album that this song came from. jjonthan (amicitia) - ""half the world away"" by oasisit's a dreamlike song, melancholic yet hopeful. though what really draws me to it is my own personal experience as someone living over 4,000 miles and an ocean from their country of origin. it's there that this song meets me and it's there that it imbues my experience with deeper meaning. ==================================================================================== **the men of eire** *amicitia's farming isle has seen a meteoric rise to prominence thanks to the efforts of two natives* eire | last month, the kingdom of amicitia acquired its first new territory in the form of the the island of eire, granted on behalf of former player, deathsu99. upon its integration to the kingdom, eire was underdeveloped, lacking much infastructure and sustainability. well, that's changed. this last month has seen a complete turnaround for eire thanks to the efforts of players tdavis232 and bighurt32. tdavis is know to many of us as amicitia's own lord chancellor and minister of agriculture.there was much curiousity surrounding lord davis at the time of his appointment due to his upbringing being outside of the lux capital. there was worry that his background in the rural hills of eire would see him unprepared for the complexities of government life. well, the lord chancellor has certainly showed that a grassroots approach can be just as good (if not greater) than the glitz and glamor of the city.under his leadership, eire's wheat fields have experienced rapid expansion. this has led to a consistently reliable source of food for all amicitian citizens. not only that, but all excess wheat has enabled the kingdom to meet quotas for multiple trade deals that have dramatically increased the kingdom's gdp.whatever that farm boy is doing seems to be working. [the advancements made on eire.]( lord davis hasn't been alone in these efforts. he's been joined by fellow eire native and farmer bighurt32. mr. hurt's contributions to the island have far exceeded harvesting and tilling, however. bighurt has proven himself to be one of amicitia's most inspired and efficient builders, completely revolutionizing the culture surrounding eirish architecture.amicitian art scholars have deemed mr. hurt's distinct and striking style of building as ""eire rustic"", notable for its simple yet grandiose expressions of the quiet yet impactful presence of rural life in national prosperity.the eire rustic builds pioneered and created by mr. hurt in the last few weeks have included a stunning windmill-styled manor, an expansive storehouse for farming supplies, an impressive stable system for breeding, and a shaded dock at the southern end of the island.mr. hurt is showing no signs of slowing down in his builds. and, thanks to him, eire has developed its own style, voice, and visual presence in the kingdom. [eire at night.]( what these two men show is the true spirit of what amicitia really is. the reality that any improvements or advancements seen in our kingdom can only be attributed to the ingenuity, devotion, skill, and heart of its citizens. the more aware we are of this the stronger, this reporter believes, our kingdom will be. ==================================================================================== **the art of amicitia** today's art piece: *blessed are those who seek wisdom* when the early amicitian settlers arrived at the island which we know today as the lux capital they were greeted by the abandonded ruins of a mysterious tribe who inhabited the island before them.among these ruins was this interesting depiction of the norse god thor.what's instantly notable about this statue is thor's lack of defined features (most noticeable being his torso), the sharp and almost crude block work, and striking presence- as if it demands to be heard.amicitian scholars have long wondered what the pre-amicitian peoples (called luxians) were attempting to convey with this statue. often polarizing amongst art critics and civilians alike, *blessed are those who seek wisdom* remains a mystifying and intrguing window into the lux capital's past. ==================================================================================== **reggie: a life remembered** *last week, tragedy struck the lux capital as the life of reggie the church parrot came to an abrupt end* the lux capital | last saturday was filled with fun and games for the amicitians. like most weekends, amicitians were enjoying their time off by engaging in favorite past times of making stick fights and playing silly buggers. this bliss was disturbingly interrupted towards the end of the day, however, when an accident in the church of amicitia saw the life of king bluebox97's parrot, reggie, come to an end. for those who don't know, reggie was a parrot personally saved by the king from a river following a visit to the real of aeros.""reggie was stuck in a river, struggling to get out,"" explains amicitian historian hiram bettey in his recent book, *the king's menagerie: a history of amicitian royal pets*. ""accounts say the king himself left the royal yacht to save him. which isn't too farfetched to believe as we all know our king has a particular penchant for animals."" after reggie was nursed back to health, he took up residence in the church of amicitia, alongside the king's chief adviser and diplomat, jjonthan.and it was in that very church that reggie met his end at the hands of a misplaced lava bucket. the king was understandably devestated. despite this, he still put on his best face to address the nation in the midst of his grief. with one sentence in particular given with tears clearly being held back by his majesty: >...though reggie is lost- his spirit can never die. regardless of one's politics or views on parrots, you can't help but believe that the king truly means this. and in the way he delievered such a short yet heartfelt proclamation, the amicitian public seemed to share that belief, too. perhaps reggie's spirit is kept alive now in all of us? it is worth mentioning, however, that some sources have claimed to have seen a parrot very similar in appearance to reggie living in lambat's margaritaville.sightings of this parrot began a week after reggie's death. [reggie's monument- designed and built by king bluebox97 himself.]( reggie will be remembered by amicitians everywhere. both in memory and in stone as the king had a monument to his beloved parrot erected mere feet from his castle. we still hear his whistle at night and are inspired by his call in the morning. ==================================================================================== that's all in the news for now. from us here at *the sapphire wave*, we just want to thank you, our readers, for supporting local journalism and for your thirst for the facts. until we meet again. stay safe out there on those waves. \-team &#x200b;",CivMC,the sapphire wave: issue iii (09/23/2023),0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/16r6nvh/the_sapphire_wave_issue_iii_09232023/,0

just left wisconsin. reagan had his big win. he won every state except one, the great state of wisconsin,” trump said. “i won wisconsin, first time since dwight eisenhower in 1952.” > >\- donald trump hi everyone! sorry i haven't posted in awhile, i've been pretty busy with college. i hope my writing hasn't gotten dull since my hiatus. i hope you enjoy this post. trump won three states in 2016 that the gop hasn't triumphed in since the nineteen eighties. this lead to him winning the presidency in arguably the greatest upset since truman warded off dewey. this meant that voters who voted for barack obama, john kerry, al gore, and bill clinton defected to trump. the finger pointing was relentless. i've talked before about the two theories of why trump won in liberal, and to a lesser extent, conservative circles, and basically they boil down to this: either trump won thanks to appealing to these voters' economic angst (cowboy hat progressive theory) or trump won thanks to appealing to their bigotry (racist hick theory). both go to great pains to avoid a hard truth that you have to deal with in a liberal democracy: not everyone is going to like you, and the people that don't like you aren't necessarily evil/stupid. in a country like ours, 40% of the country is guaranteed to dislike you at any given moment. the fact of the matter is that if democrats can get around trump's white working class appeal (i died typing that) in the rust belt states, they should do it. before i go on a big tangent about how trump was actually super destructive for the gop's prospects everywhere in america, including the rust belt, we need to realize that there's nothing that makes the obama-trump voters particularly special. awhile ago, i complained that working class had become completely divorced from the actual idea of an american worker and now meant, basically, a white republican, and i stand by that. the fact of the matter is that there is nothing that makes the west pa fracker somehow more moral than the philadelphia suburbanite, nor does one party trading the former for the latter constitute ""abandoning real america"". the gop, and some progressives, don't seem to understand this concept. the republicans, perpetually martyrs to their own base, have leaned into the working-class larp. kari lake famously told the mccain republicans to ""get out"", while marco rubio of all people made an impassioned speech on the senate floor in defense of the working union man's rights. not only is all of this stuff bullshit, it's also politically unwise and misunderstands the nature of trump's 2016 victory. i'll stop jerking your chain and spit it out: trump didn't win because he crossed the aisle, he won because he doubled down on right-wing politics even as he was arguably the most liberal nominee in recent republican history. hillary clinton was very unpopular and ran a dull, unimaginative campaign that was mostly focused around her own shortcomings. trump didn't triumph because he found a ton of mondale voters and aligned with their positions on trade, he won because the mondale voters were fed up with liberals and were ready for the lib destroyer in chief. to understand why a guy who openly wiped his ass with conservative orthodoxy became the most powerful republican since roscoe conkling, we need to understand the direction the gop has been going in. ever since reagan left the political scene, a few collective emotions have dominated his party. the first is the increasing sense of alienation. nostalgia is hardly limited to the right, but conservatives are very concerned about moral decay and believe that 1) the democrats are making alarming ground 2) the republicans aren't doing anything about it. this has been the case since 1992, when george h. w. bush raised taxes and the party rank-and-file responded with pat buchanan. with a mentality like this, fighting the left has taken priority over actual progress. as an example, trump was an amazingly ineffective president that tossed out a whole bunch of old conservative policy planks, and the right overwhelmingly supports him. the right believes america's institutions, particularly the press and the federal government, are controlled by the left. trump is the one inspiring such bitter opposition from these quarters. as a result, many conservatives think he's onto something. the simple answer as to why trump won the rust belt was that its traditionally democratic base in the rural areas was drifting right, and then the democrats walled off and nominated a ridiculously unpopular candidate while the republicans nominated a guy who, despite becoming the first republican to hold the pride flag, had used his one genuine talent to rebrand himself as the right's last chance to hit back against the establishment. understanding the sickness, we can also understand what cures are not going to work. connecticut senator chris murphy's plan to meet up with rural georgians and address the ""wreckage of neoliberalism"" won't curry favor on the other side of the aisle, and won't shore up the democrats' margins in states like pennsylvania, wisconsin, and michigan. murphy is hardly alone. joe biden, since 2020, has engaged in a comically fragile larp about being a white union worker (his family comes from management) who will defend/create jobs and restore the middle class. it's bullshit and ultimately isn't going to help a lot. the actual bills he has passed, such as chips, may very well help him but that would be for separate reasons entirely. the democrats' key to the rust belt is overwhelming liberal turnout to counter the overwhelming conservative turnout. trump was a one-play card that can't work twice. since 2016, the left has turned out with astounding discipline almost without fail. were those presidential victories in 2016 and almost victories in 2020 and maybe victories in 2024 really worth it? the gop is getting slaughtered everywhere else. the michigan republican party had a miniature night of the long knives and is now bankrupt and chaired by the kind of nut you expect to devote time to local politics, handing the democrats their first trifecta there in a generation. meanwhile, in wisconsin, perhaps the most disproportionately powerful conservative political machine is being dismantled piece by piece. last year, in pennsylvania, the party actually ran a celebrity doctor from another state and a dude whose main pitch was ""i will literally rig the next election"". all are dramatically outgunned in statewide races and losing ground in legislative races. time will tell if joe biden will be able to turn those maybe victories into actual victories next year, but either way can anyone seriously say that trump's political legacy for rust belt republicans was a good one? no other republican candidate in the rust belt not named donald trump has had a remotely good day since he won those states by the tiniest of margins after an election full of freak coincidences and dominated by low turnout. like i've said, i don't buy the argument that trump has some unique strength with the rust belt that can't be replicated and/or made up for by the other republicans (minus cruz) that he beat in 2016, but would it even be worth it? and there's been another aftereffect of running the lib owner in chief we've already seen the beginnings of. and that little bit about ""unique strength"" might be the case now, but for very different reasons than ""working class appeal"". this is trump's last election. obviously, should he win, he will not be able to run again, and if he loses then he's probably toast. what then? remember how nearly every single one of trump's imitators on the state level, both in the rust belt and elsewhere, has flopped? conservatism in the united states has become uniquely linked to a guy whose days in politics are, like all of us, numbered. max weber identified three sources of authority-- *traditional*, such as institutions like monarchy and the church, *democratic*, where authority is derived from rules and laws voted on by the people, and *charismatic*, where legitimacy comes from a charismatic leader. the central problem with the last one is that nobody is perfect and everybody dies. trump is no exception. he won't be around forever and makes bad choices for the party. nowadays, every republican's wikipedia profile will have a whole section devoted to ""donald trump"". the party dutifully runs out people on the wrong side of the trump question, electoral consequences be damned. a huge part of this party's base is intrinsically connected to trump and views any effort to undermine him or simply offer an alternative to him as not being truly conservative. as a consequence, hard right stalwarts like desantis got labeled as rinos just on virtue of running against trump. so, when he is gone, the 2028 republican nominee will be left with the unenviable position of filling socks he, by definition, can't fill, making sure every niche group of nuts that don't want to compromise is mollified, and winning the general election with a country getting younger, more secular, and less white by the day. trump's unique personality has lead to a myth of infallibility his conservative rivals can't cook up. there was something weirdly emasculate about desanctus and lyin' ted, and i have no doubt the same problem would happen with vivek ramaswamy or josh hawley in 2028. which brings me to a bigger point: the right's coalition is now so radicalized and embittered that they not only can't accept the ""smart answer"", they also can't necessarily accept someone from the other camp. these are the rational, linear consequences of running an entire political party on retaking the country from the establishment. take josh hawley and vivek ramaswamy again. hawley wants to, effectively, nationalize the tech companies and ban pornography. meanwhile, ramaswamy wants to (barely exaggerating here) abolish the government and return to the gold standard. trump is pretty popular with republicans. if these wannabes or someone in their vein is to get the nomination, they will actually be turning off a sizable part of trump's followers. you think the guys voting for trump because of the tax cuts and good economy are going to eat up hawley's government interventionist rhetoric? or that abolishing social security will play well with the general electorate? funny story, my dad, to this day, doesn't really know who desantis is and didn't understand the concept when i explained it to him because taxing corporations and canceling textbooks doesn't sound like a very republican thing to do. in short, trump damaged the gop badly in the long run and 2024 is really a question of whether or not they can coast on biden's unpopularity. he also damaged them very badly in the short term, and if john kasich had won the 2016 nomination, he'd be president with a republican trifecta right now. the republicans chose donald trump instead, and now they're stuck with this ill-fated experiment until it runs its course, and it looks like only the positive/redeemable elements of trumpism will leave with the man himself.",AngryObservation,"angry observation: long and short term, trump has been a disaster for the

today's post in my series on the serial killers of the soviet union and russia is a particularly appalling and depraved individual by the name of [alexei sukletin]( a murderer, cannibal, and vampire, who committed seven murders between 1979 and 1985 in the soviet republic of tatarstan. while a relatively obscure figure as far as russian serial killers go, he certainly deserves infamy as an utterly callous and degraded criminal. **alexei vasilyevich sukletin** was born on 23 march 1943 in the city of kazan. his father was killed in world war ii before alexei's birth, so he was raised by his mother who worked as a field medic. it was already during the boy's childhood that his violent tendencies first manifested as he apparently strangled a cat when he was just six years old, killing a dog at some point later. young sukletin was a poor and disinterested student at school and started drinking as a teenager. in 1960, he attempted to rape a woman by knocking her out and pinning her to ground but was thankfully interrupted by two men who apprehended the would-be rapist and took him to the nearest police station along with his victim. due to his young age and ostensible remorse shown at the trial (he was crying his eyes out and begging for leniency), sukletin was only given a two-year sentence. as we know, rapists aren't exactly held in high regard in prison, so sukletin became a victim of derision and bullying by fellow inmates who nicknamed him the alligator for his prominent jaw and surly demeanor. prison did nothing to remedy the youth's anti-social tendencies and after being set free in 1962, he soon committed another crime. this time around, he convinced two acquaintances of his to rob an elderly woman's apartment. they trio introduced themselves to the owner as maintenance workers and after being let inside, knocked her out and robbed the place. however, their luck quickly ran out as the woman soon regained consciousness and contacted the police, providing them with enough details of her attackers to get them arrested that same day. as sukletin was a repeat offender, he got a lengthy 12-year sentence. to make the stint more comfortable, sukletin became an informant for the prison authorities, telling on inmates who broke the rules. for that, he was considered part of the lowest possible caste by his fellow prisoners, who held him in contempt, beat him up, and even raped him. he failed to secure an early release and left prison in 1976, exactly 12 years later. at 33, sukletin had spent half of his life behind bars and lacked formal education or work experience, so his prospects were looking decidedly grim. while he managed to get married in kazan, he was clearly not made for family life, cheating on his wife, striking her in fits of anger, and eventually leaving her after finding out she was pregnant. he moved to a nearby village called [vasilyevo]( and soon got hired as a guard at a community garden. it was there that sukletin met his future accomplice. madina (or [dina]( for short) shakirova was born in 1956 in the vasilyevo village. she grew up in poverty and after barely finishing school, moved to neighbouring kazakhstan to look for well-paid work. dina's efforts proved unsuccessful and she left the country after a female co-worker tried to rape her. having moved to kazan, dina got a job, first at a factory and then at a farm, and soon fell in love with a man called rashid. the two got together but after it turned out that dina was pregnant, he insisted on her getting an abortion. she refused, and rashid left her, which caused the young woman to contemplate suicide before deciding to carry on for the sake of her daughter. she met sukletin in 1979 and despite the man's alcoholism and moody nature, the insecure, poorly educated single mother was impressed by his apparent knowledge of literature and decent manners. it wasn't long before she left the baby to be raised by her parents and moved in with sukletin. sukletin was unhappy with the meagre wage he was earning as a guard, so he talked dina and a friend of his called rinat volkov into pulling a blackmail scheme. the woman would travel from the village to the city and take a taxi back late in the evening. during the drive, she would complain to the taxi driver about her unhappy marriage and eventually invite him to the house for sex. if the driver agreed, they would go to bed only to be ""suddenly"" discovered by sukletin and volkov playing the roles of dina's husband and brother respectively. they would pretend to be taking photos of the ""lovers"" in bed and blackmail the driver into paying them lest the photos were made public. the scheme was successful but sukletin eventually got bored of extorting money from taxi drivers and decided to escalate his crimes, acting on his darker, more violent urges. it's unclear where his taste for human flesh originated from, but his two biggest heroes were jack the ripper and cannibalistic central african dictator jean-bedel bokassa. one day, sukletin told dina that he wanted to kill her friend ludmila, which dina initially thought was a joke. after ludmila came over and sukletin had sex with her, he gestured to dina that he was about to kill the visitor, at which point the terrified woman asked ludmila to leave. that infuriated sukletin who proceeded to beat dina black and blue, after which she became even more subservient to him. in november 1979 (or 1981 depending on the source), sukletin met a woman called ekaterina osetrova at the kazan train station and invited her back to his house in the village. dina shakirova was waiting for them inside, and when the pair emerged from the bedroom having had sex, she distracted ekaterina, while sukletin knocked the woman out with a hammer wrapped in a rag. he then placed the victim into a tub, bound her, cut her throat, and started drinking blood from the wound, ordering dina to do the same. after the woman's heart stopped beating, sukletin and dina strung her up and dismembered the body, cutting out the organs. they used the meat to make soup and dumplings, eating some themselves and feeding the rest to their dog. ekaterina's bones were buried in the back garden. in early january 1980 (or 1982 if we go by the other timeline), sukletin and dina bumped into two young women on the street and invited them home to celebrate new year, where the women, tatiana and elena, got drunk and went to bed. next morning, tatiana was nowhere to be found, but elena was told that her friend had left for kazan at the crack of dawn and was then quickly escorted out of the house. in reality, tatiana had been murdered in her sleep and dismembered, and the only reason elena was left alive was because sukeltin thought she was too skinny for his tastes. after the pair got rid of elena, dina went to a local store and bought a tape recorder using tatiana's passport, while sukletin carved the victim's meat and sold it to the neighbours under the guise of pork. just a month later, in february, 15-year-old rezeda galimova was lured to sukletin's house. the girl had just enrolled into a university in kazan and was looking for a place to stay, so sukletin promised to help. sadly after rezeda entered the cannibal's house, she was raped and bludgeoned to death with a hammer. the girl was pleading for dina's help, but shakirova ignored her and even wore the victim's blouse after her death (the rest of the clothes were burned.) in march, sukletin brought home 22-year-old nadezhda sityavina, whom the killer had taken a liking to and even considered dumping dina for. soon afterwards, however, he killed nadezhda in a fit of anger, keeping some of her meat in the fridge and selling the rest to the neighbours, while dina got a new blouse to wear. one day, nadezhda's friend came from kazan inquiring about the missing woman and noticed dina wearing nadezhda's clothes. sukletin figured she knew too much, so he murdered her as well. by spring, sukletin had killed and consumed five women but his appetite was far from sated. at the same time, his relationship with dina shakirova was becoming increasingly strained. in may, the cannibal was visiting kazan when he spotted 11-year-old valentina elikova buying some ice cream. introducing himself as the girl's uncle, he invited her back to his house and was so convincing that valentina eventually agreed to go with him. the sight of a child was too much for dina and she attacked sukletin in an attempt to save valentina but was beaten up herself. for some reason, sukletin decided to keep the girl alive for a while, so one day when he was out dina tried to put her on a train to safety. unfortunately sukletin intercepted them on the way to the station, brought them back to the house, and beat dina into unconsciousness, while valentina met the same fate as the previous victims. according to other sources, this last episode did not happen, and sukletin knocked out dina and murdered the girl as soon as the two came back from swimming in a nearby lake the same day that valentina arrived to the village. the breaking point for shakirova came shortly after, when sukletin ordered her to go out and kidnap a baby for him to eat, which in her mind put her own baby daughter in direct jeopardy. again, there's conflicting information saying that the baby episode happened in march that year, shortly before sukletin's birthday, in which case it was the valentina elikova murder in may that became the last drop for dina. in any case, she gathered up her courage and left to live with her parents. sukletin wasn't worried about her going to the police and instead found a new girlfriend in 23-year-old [lydia fyodorova]( whom he met through his drinking buddy and lydia's relative anatoly nikitin. sukletin was aware of the fact that he needed a new accomplice, so at some point he confided lydia in his activities, presenting his murders as ""public service"" meant to rid society of its dregs. to the killer's chagrin, lydia not only refused to help but eventually started to blackmail him, threatening to alert the police unless he provided her money to fuel her alcoholism. deciding that lydia had become too dangerous, sukletin conspired with her own relative nikitin to get rid of her. on 12 march 1985, the trio were drinking at sukletin's when suddenly the two men turned on lydia and proceeded to rape and murder her. after burning her clothes, they dismembered the body, ate some of it, and got rid of the remains by placing the head into a vat filled with water and hiding the bones in a nearby shed. sukletin then contacted dina shakirova (she and her parents lived in the same village), and despite having been regularly abused and threatened by him, the woman still unexplicably decided to come back to the village, where she helped conceal the traces of lydia fyodorova's murder. soon after, lydia's family went to the police, saying she had gone missing. having established that the woman had recently moved in with sukletin, the police paid him a visit and even briefly searched the house but didn't find anything suspicious and were satisfied with the explanation that lydia had left in an unknown direction after a spat. however, the cannibal's days as a free man were numbered. in june 1985, sukletin was drinking with a friend called gennady uglov, when suddenly uglov asked him about lydia's disappearance. the drunk sukletin then blurted out that he had murdered and eaten seven people, which uglov didn't take seriously. sukletin then suggested that they kill dina together and eat her heart, but uglov waved it off as a joke as well. to prove just how serious he was, sukletin took uglov outside and showed him the vat containing lydia fyodorova's head. the horrified uglov stayed silent for the moment, but while the two continued their binge in kazan, he took an opportunity to lose sukletin in a crowd and rushed to the police. however, the law enforcement considered his story little more than drunken ramblings and didn't follow up on it. the next day, sukletin, who had become suspicious, invited uglov over and tried to kill him, hitting him on the head with a champagne bottle. the injured man managed to escape, however, and made his way to the hospital where the concerned doctors called the police. when officers arrived to sukletin's property this time, they instantly felt a nauseating stench and quickly discovered the head in the vat, as well as a piece of human skin in the garden. inside the house they found the victims' passports and personal belongings. the cannibal's fridge contained human meat and half a bucket worth of rendered human fat. despite no traces of blood, a nail was discovered upon which sukletin hanged his victims' bodies, as well as slabs and knives used for dismemberment. it took three days and a whole company of soldiers to unearth the remains buried all over the garden, which in the end amounted to four bags worth of bones. sukletin was immediately arrested, followed by dina shakirova a few hours later. after news had spread about sukletin being a cannibal and a murderer, the locals burned his house to the ground and turned the place into a dump site. during the interrogation, sukletin confessed to killing lydia fyodorova but initially denied any other wrongdoing until he was told that more remains had been found in his garden, at which point he admitted guilt in the other murders as well. however, he never showed any hint of remorse, proudly insisting that he was cleansing society of ""amoral elements."" he even gifted one of the detectives an autographed photo of himself with the inscription ""*to remember your first meeting with a cannibal.""* during his time in jail, he bragged about being a cannibal to other inmates in an attempt to impress them but was quickly beaten up the same way he was during his very first stint in prison. as for dina, who was kept at a local monastery for her own safety, she only admitted to covering up lydia fyodorova's murder at first but after being threatened with capital punishment for her part in the killings that sukletin had just confessed to, she started to talk for fear of making her daughter an orphan. *""i never killed anyone myself, though i admit that i was sukletin's accomplice. i prepared warm water and after the murders, i helped string the bodies up for dismemberment. i carved the meat. i used the meat for cooking. i cleaned the house after the murders to conceal traces of blood... i admit my responsibility for these crimes and don't diminish it, but it was sukletin who roped me into it. i was afraid. better to be executed than be eaten by him.""* along with sukletin and shakirova, the police also arrested anatoly nikitin who helped the cannibal kill his last victim, as well as rinat volkov who took part in the extortion scheme. sukletin, shakirova, and nikitin were transferred to moscow where they underwent psychiatric evaluation and were all deemed fit to stand trial (to sukletin's great surprise.) shakirova was diagnosed with alcoholism and ""psychopathy-like personality changes"", whereas sukletin was noted to possess psychopathic personality traits, such as egocentrism, heightened excitability, cruelty, and vindictiveness. *""why did you kill for the first time and how did you come to use human meat for food?""* *""i was curious. i love broads. there. like being in bed with them. wanted to see what they taste like.""* *""are you not afraid of god, sukletin? of judgement day?""* *""ha-ha, what do i care for god? i'm my own god and devil! to be honest, i am afraid of death. don't feel like dying right now, haven't lived long enough. beat it with your judgement day!""* the trial lasted for a month, with sukletin behaving in a calm manner and even being allowed to smoke in the court room so as to coax a confession out of him. he relished the details of his crimes, refusing to believe that he could be executed for killing prostitutes and alcoholics, but was always adamant that he never raped his victims. unsurprisingly, however, he was sentenced to death by gunshot. his last wish was to have a meeting with dina, during which he asked for her forgiveness and gave her an apple. the death sentence was carried out in kazan on 29 june 1987. as for the others, sharikova and nikitin were sentenced to 15 years in prison, while volkov received 7 years. dina was spared from a death sentence because she didn't commit any of the murders, was coerced by sukletin into being his accomplice, and showed remorse for her part in the crimes. she served her sentence in two prisons but wasn't treated well in either. at first, other inmates provoked shakirova and beat her up, giving her the derisive nickname ""dina the meat grinder."" after she was transferred to another prison, she was boycotted and ostracised by the prisoners. despite being [released]( in 2001, dina was unable to break the cycle of misery, coming back to the vasilyevo village, where she was shunned by her relatives and neighbours. she married again but her husband was an alcoholic like sukletin. [madina]( shakirova died some time after 2008 from alcoholic cardiomyopathy, her body was discovered near kazan train station. &#x200b; **previous posts in the series:** [anatoly slivko (part one)]( [anatoly slivko (part two)]( [vladimir ionesian]( [alexander berlizov]( [gennady mikhasevich]( [vladimir vinnichevsky]( [andrei chikatilo (part one)]( [andrei chikatilo (part two)]( [andrei chikatilo (part three)](",serialkillers,serial killers of russia - cannibal and vampire alexei sukletin,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialkillers/comments/16qavwl/serial_killers_of_russia_cannibal_and_vampire/,0

its because when they play a real team, they fail in every single way possible and nobody acts surprised it happened. colorado was no different but what made it extra special was the hype. and guess what, fox is still ignoring it (big noon kickoff usc vs colorado next week)! why would you go to boulder 3 times in 4 weeks when colorado got openly pantsed by a legit team like oregon? the ducks exploded on a weak buffs defense and put up 35 in the first half alone. after next week, i hope i’ll never discuss colorado as a pac-12 contender again. now give me that theme music! \*shout playing\* **ucla vs utah** bad news utes. cam moon rising is still out. maybe this is the time for freshman qb dante moore to break out in his first start at ucla. \*ding sound\*. one play, the game is over. not to say that ucla had some effort, at least their defense showed up. if this didn’t happen, then there might’ve been overtime. oh, what a shocker. dante had less than 50% completion despite outthrowing a 3rd string qb on yards. to be fair, utah’s offense wasn’t on par either. you know your team is top-tier when you are 4-0 on a tough start and your starting qb hasn’t taken a snap yet. speaking of him, they might need him next week when they’re in corvallis. gonna be hard to beat a former clemson qb, just saying. **ole miss vs bama** who would ever think that bama would be at a crossroads this early in the season? if you are a bama fan, the last two weeks were hell. turns out the decision to start tyler buchner was a complete failure and milroe now has the starting job again. for now. to be fair, ole miss had a qb conundrum of their own with transfer spencer sanders threatening jaxson dart’s job. it felt like a retread for bama in the first half. the offenses on both sides were muted. ole miss had the lead for most of the game. but then, milroe’s skill set increased tenfold and the offense came to life to aid an already lights-out defense. you really think that bama would lose consecutive home games? not against ole miss in a rivalry that bama owned more than other teams. the next potential upset bid is two weeks from now with bama coming to kyle field. or let’s hope zach arnett grows some balls and get miss state ready next week. **oregon state vs wazzu** it is a bittersweet game. the two lone survivors of the pac-12 squaring off in a ranked matchup. prior to the matchup, there were talks with the mountain west about some kind of deal. there were preliminary talks of ideas such as relegation, just like what european soccer is doing. onto the actual game, i think we got another weekly pac-12 heisman candidate to showcase. this week is cameron ward for wazzu who threw for 404 yards against an upstart beavs squad. by the 3rd quarter, wazzu would take full control of the game. dj uiagalelei and company would clean up their act with 3 touchdowns in the 4th, but it was too far out of reach. congrats, wazzu! you are the unofficial winner of your conference this year. let them hate. **iowa vs penn state** there is nothing like a white-out game at penn state. this is where student spirit is at its best and the opposing team’s worst nightmares. weird that penn state had chosen this game instead of michigan, but they did. after all, these two teams met as #3 and #4 back in 2021 in iowa. a pinch of bad weather from a tropical storm should make it chaotic. oh, you thought that this ranked matchup was a game? bitch, you don’t know iowa. they have no offense. and in a whiteout environment, this was one of their worst performances in recent memory. no points. and when you play in that environment, you signed your death warrant without even starting training camp the previous year. drew allar just had to command the game while the fans did the hard work for him. 31 points exactly. once again, why this game instead of michigan? **ohio state vs notre dame** goddammit, i was this close to making this into a greatest game but i’m keeping my word. notre dame has been there and done that. but the one rival that the irish haven’t dominated was the buckeyes. they haven’t defeated those ohio bums since 1936, albeit there had not been enough games played between the two teams. both teams came in undefeated and with big expectations. although this was not saturday night big ten, ohio state would set the mood with a low-scoring game. that and marvin harrison couldn’t stop being injured for one fucking second. both teams knew that this game would come down to the trenches, but ohio state would have the more explosive weapons to keep the irish on their toes. the buckeyes did pull out with a 10-point lead but notre dame crept back in. 14 unanswered points and the lead in the 4th. and now, the buckeyes, running out of time, have to score a touchdown. they would have to go for 4th down. “mccord. handed off. egbuka. around the edge! he is stonewalled! notre dame gets the stop! and they get the football back!” brutal. it was 4th and 1, too. this should’ve been the dagger, but the defense made the stand to force a punt. ohio state would have one more chance. an intentional grounding would make it 3rd and 19 with 15 seconds left. “mccord. floats it. endzone! caught short! egbuka makes the catch inside the 1!” oh yeah, ohio state has receivers. the irish would be thanking touchdown jesus it was not in the endzone. it all comes down to this. final play of the game. sudden death! “give it to him. trayanum up the middle! he’s in! touchdown ohio state! they walk it off at notre dame stadium!” heartbreak. the buckeyes would pull out the wiser move and run into the endzone. what made this play worse for the irish was that there were 10 men on defense instead of the usual 11. there should’ve been a third man who would try to block the run from chip trayanum. ryan day would take it and run and take shots at legend lou holtz while being interviewed. ohio vs the world, you say. after this loss, notre dame is on the brink. they have usc and clemson in the future. but they also have duke next. college gameday is gonna be in durham next week. it’s a shame the season would potentially end like that for the irish. what a game. **2 minute warning** aside from those ranked matchups played, we had plenty of more action to go around. jim harbaugh is back as the sheriff in ann arbor and the refs helped in a beatdown over rutgers. at least the knights covered. wisconsin extends their winning streak over purdue to 17 straight. lsu won in a shootout in death valley in the first golden boot matchup played in september. byu, ucf, and cincy were all hazed by the kansas schools and oklahoma while texas put an end to their closest conference rivalry by decapitating baylor. we had miami vs miami a few weeks ago; now the sequel. houston is the real houston as they beat sam houston state. georgia, tennessee, and florida are back to beating up inferior opponents. virginia tech keeps losing to them as marshall picks up a signature victory for the sun belt. louisville did better than florida state against boston college. syracuse defeated army in the first game between the two new york schools since 1996. the iron skillet will stay in fort worth as sonny dykes wins his 4th straight meeting as head coach and 2nd with tcu. kentucky and maryland are 4-0 each as they took down their first shitty conference opponent. will rogers threw for almost 500 yards but came up short against beamer ball. arkansas state gets a win. that’s a bad thing if you’re paying attention to the bottom 10. umass would come short of sweeping the new mexico schools as the lobos escape in overtime. and south florida earned its first fbs victory in almost two years. well-earned considering they were covering bama last week with flying colors. **high score** shoutout to miami, ohio for setting the high score this weekend. coming off of their first victory bell win in 15 years, they would drop 62 on hbcu school, delaware state. **lolcow of the week** we got a special one. remember that northwestern team that was fucked to mars and back? they were down 21 against minnesota. you may think that the game was over then, but the wildcats somehow had dark magic and they erased the deficit at the last second to force overtime. charlie mangieri was the hero of the game as he caught the game-winning walk-off touchdown to seal northwestern’s first big ten win since that ireland game and first on american soil since that rutgers game in 2021. to clarify, minnesota, you just lost to sexual hazing u. automatic lolcow. i gotta wash my mouth. here’s to another football feast, everybody!",UrinatingTree,college sportsball week 4: showdown saturday,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UrinatingTree/comments/16qzgn7/college_sportsball_week_4_showdown_saturday/,0

""that stings."" he was referring to everything of course. but his midsection hurt worse than anywhere else. that made sense considering what the additional tests had said happened in there. as he was sitting on the edge of the bed, bracing himself to stand, something shifted and he burped. ""sweet mother of fuck."" he said softly. ""that smells awful."" ""are you okay chief?"" nurse dennis asked. he'd been the lead tech that had helped stabilize vickers after he'd come through. and also the one vickers had absentmindedly thrown across the room in his confusion. ""take your time."" ""i'm good."" he said as he pressed up off the bed and stood on wobbly legs. ""would you believe me if i said that my last hospital stay was for worse damage than this?"" ""yeah i read the report."" dennis said as he kept his hands up in case vickers stumbled. ""the fact that you survived either of those is insane. but then again you're a seven foot tall cat. perspective says anything is possible."" on the other side of the plexi-glass enclosure the colonel stood with her arms held behind her back. she'd never actually seen any of the were's up close before. the one that had been kidnapped in the desert had been sent through to the site near sturgis, and she was not on the roster to visit there any time soon. video feeds and medical pictures did not do justice to the massive operator only a few yards away from her. as vickers went through the motions of maneuvering as the two nurses guided him, his hands had to be tucked in or they would run across the ceiling. the four-x scrub top they'd gotten him strained at his shoulders and chest, and the matching pants were so short that they looked like capris. and when he was done with the simple exercises, and the nurses had noted his issues and complaints, he turned to look at her. it was eerie looking into his eyes. he still had the combination of cold calculation and severe (yet surpressed) ptsd that would inevitably give him a thousand yard stare when he retired. but to see it in the eyes and facial structure of a predatory cat made them even more intimidating. and the fact that he towered over her only made it worse. *glad he's on our side.* she thought as he approached the chair the was set in front of her and the communication device. *at least on paper. the russians and chinese would shit themselves if they found out we had someone like this.* ""colonel."" he said in that deep voice that still had a boston accent. ""long time no see."" ""master chief."" she replied with a nod as she pressed the button to speak into the room. ""how are you feeling?"" ""been worse."" he said honestly. ""how did it go with the others? have they even come over yet?"" ""not yet."" she answered. ""after seeing what happened with you they're holding off while adjustments are made."" ""as they say,"" vickers said with a shrug. ""that first step was, in fact, a doozy."" she chuckled. ""glad you're in good spirits chief."" she said. vickers tilted his head. ""stuff like this is why i opted to go first."" he explained. ""figure i can take it. and i imagine the data was helpful for both sides."" she nodded. he was right on both accounts. ""so."" she began. ""obviously this sets things back a bit. you need to recover, even if only for a few days, and we can't bring the elder or his guard over just yet. not until we've got some sop's in place."" vickers nodded. that was nothing unexpected. ""in the meantime the president has diverted from where he was going to meet them and is coming here instead."" she said, and it was obvious that she was more than a little perturbed by that fact. ""busy schedule and what not."" vickers shrugged. personally he didn't care to meet the president. he also knew that the meeting was primarily so that he could meet the elder. besides, he'd already shaken the man's hand a few times before. he wouldn't complain if he missed that meeting. though he also knew that he was, for all intents and purposes, the government's first defense if atrafar or the elder decided to cause problems. not that he expected them too. at least not with the president anyways. he did have some doubts about the pack they'd be meeting though. ""along with that."" she continued, breaking him out of his thoughts. ""since things are shifting, and the elder isn't expected for at least a week. we've decided to bring your fellow team members to you."" that surprised him. he'd expected to rendezvous with them during a minor detour to pendleton. the fact that they were pulling a bunch of seals inland and away from their normal schedule meant that they were prioritizing this meeting. ""hmmmm."" he said as he considered that info. ""they really want you to convince at least a few of them of your way of seeing things."" she said with a slow and quiet pantomime of biting something. he got the message. ""tough."" he said. ""not happening."" ""that's what i said."" she informed him. ""and i get the sense that the concept is a bit of a mixed bag to them. some seem for it. but most see it as an unnecessary danger."" ""they should probably listen to those guys."" he replied. then he gestured to himself. ""this... comes with some distinct downsides. and as captain dennis here can attest, some of them are a touch dangerous."" he nodded at dennis, who'd turned to look over at them at the mention of his name. ""i've already made them aware."" she said. ""but you know how the hawks are."" he nodded as he rolled his eyes. they always wanted more, never the same or less. ""when do they get here?"" he asked. ""and who all is coming?"" she pulled up the tablet she'd been holding behind her back. on it she had the roster. ""team three."" she said after a moment. he locked up as he tried to remember who was on that team the last time he was on earth. ""ramirez, gupton, teller, and magsaysay are the main ones you served with."" she said. ""rest are new to you. he considered that. not bad for almost three years away from the main force. ""surprised guppy's still in."" he said. ""he was having his third kid last time i talked to him."" ""yeeeeaaahh."" she said slowly in response to that. he raised an eyebrow. ""not my business to tell you. but that ended up being a bit of drama according to his file."" vickers just nodded. guppy and his wife were always drama. though, he suspected that that was likely ex... wife now. back then he'd been glad that gupton had been assigned to a different team. ""so, how we gonna do this?"" he asked. ""gonna just have me walk out and blind side them with the full cats musical or something?"" ""depends on how your singing voice is."" she said with a smirk. then she shook her head. ""no. we've got some ideas."" ""can't wait."" he said as she began explaining the plan. she took a deep breath and braced herself, causing him to cock an eyebrow again. ""there's more?"" he asked. she nodded. ""lieutenant williams will be there."" she said. then she tilted her head for a second. ""though she is a lieutenant commander now."" there was a grinding noise that the intercom barely picked up from inside the room as vickers' jaw clenched at the announcement. dennis and blick, the other nurse, both turned to look at him curiously. he turned his head a bit and cracked his neck without using his hands. ""that's.... not an issue."" he said through clenched teeth. ""i don't answer to her anymore."" ""i hope that proves true chief."" she replied. ""remember the... difficult... position you're in."" *take no shit.* he thought, remembering the ground rules he and choi had come up with. *take... no... shit.* ""roger ma'am."" he said instead. \--------------------------- ""so yeah. like i said; just press the bracelets to the little sensor and the computers will unlock."" the sergeant leading the briefing said in response to one of the questions that one of the wolves had had. samantha had been meaning to tell them about that, but she'd shown up almost late after having dozed off a bit. the meeting they were meant to be having had been postponed a bit. something had occurred that had delayed their trip here and they were working through the travel arrangements. but they were still coming. other than that things were fairly simple. the base had attached a handful of officers and nco's to help them with anything they needed. this was mostly for if they had issues with the room, or needed to get medical attention or something. but they would also be offering simplified pt sessions for anyone who needed some exercise, and could field travel requests if any of them wanted to go somewhere as a group. though the town outside the base was small and had very little to do. and the requests would have to be routed up and reviewed. the sergeant, last name washington, was a lot peppier and more excited to be working with them than the lieutenant from before. samantha thought the young sgt might get along well with most of the wolves. when the briefing was done she went outside. a few of the other wolves did to, mostly to check out the exercise equipment, though a couple of them did start tossing one of the footballs back and forth. she sat alone off to the side on a bench that was definitely frequented by the smokers of whatever unit usually stayed at these barracks. she could smell the cigarette and cbd smoke traces, even if nobody had used this spot for a few weeks. she could also smell the sour scent of dip spit. she just liked it because it was away. she didn't like that she couldn't see the sky past the massive camo-net and cargo boxes. but it was still a nice bit of solitude. one of the others walked past and looked at her as he did. he tilted his head a bit and somehow the part of her brain that was causing most of her problems got an entire sentence out of the simple motion. ""i'm fine."" she said with a nod. ""just.... taking it all in."" the other wolf nodded and continued on. she watched as they moved over near the cargo containers and began checking them and the netting out curiously. ""you okay jenk?"" the familiar, slightly african accented, ngoko asked from over near a set of pull-up bars. she looked over just as he raised his arms up and grabbed the bars. she gave him a thumbs up. she had a feeling that the fellow e-4 knew exactly what that meant. but he nodded and began pulling himself up and down.. the truth was she was still in a funk. the... event... between her and fletcher, had just happened only a little over a week before. and he had assured her that they were going to be okay, and she thought he was right, but it was still pretty fresh. they'd both agreed that this trip would be a good reset for the relationship, letting him recover a bit more while she also came to terms with what had happened. and the fact that the barracks had her feeling like she was back in the army before her transformation had only made the reset part of it feel more real. she took a deep breath as she just tried to stay grounded. ""burgers in the kitchen!!!"" brighton yelled from the door nearby, breaking her concentration. ""raw ones are already set up!"" that knocked the concept of being back in her pre-transformation life out of her mind. she would have never considered eating an uncooked burger before becoming a wolf. but right now a raw burger sounded..... amazing. she got up and tried not to look like she was rushing toward the door. the wolf who'd gone over to check out the containers and net was just flat out running. *fucking idiot brain.* she thought.

processing everything dassyra had just told me. not only had mr. byrne, the old and eccentric millionaire, actually traveled to farcrest, he had also contacted dassyra’s tribe, and revealed his otherworldly nature to them. on top of that, he had also sired a half-orc child that turned out to be one of my pupils. “let's gather those pesky herbs of yours and call it a day. i can see in your face that you are exhausted.” dassyra said in a humorous tone. “i wouldn't be if a certain someone hadn't tried to kill me.” i replied with a tired smile. wise or not, byrne had instructed dassyra to kill any person from earth despite their true intentions. i glanced at dassyra’s tattooed arm. after experiencing the raw strength of her blows, i could only hope for wolf to inherit at least half of her mother’s strength. “mothers can be overprotective at times.” dassyra apologized as she tried to get up, however, her knees gave out before she could stand. she clenched her teeth and placed her hand on her stomach. i instantly jumped up to help her. despite her endurance, the wound on her side was too recent for her to try to swat down a slippery scholar with five levels in \[swordsmanship\]. “it's just a small bruise.” dassyra said, ignoring the fact that the ice wraith buried its claws deep into her flesh. i could only guess what kind of pain she was experiencing. a mere scratch from the undead puppet had left my body completely numb. considering how nonchalant dassyra and elincia were about big and powerful monsters, i guessed survival was different in this corner of the universe. my near-death-experiences counter was too high for a lifetime, at least for someone from earth. dassyra placed her arm around my shoulders and dropped her weight on my back. my knees complained and i instantly regretted skipping leg day for the last seven years. dassyra was built like a rhino. “you are heavy.” i grunted as i helped the two meter amazon of an orc. “thanks, it's hard to maintain the muscle here in the outpost. we have no gymnasium here and training with the younglings barely makes the cut.” dassyra replied as she displayed a tusked smile for me. i didn’t mention there were times when wolf and firana left me gasping for air after sparring. “certain someone tried to kill me!” the changeling barked before returning to its vulture form and taking off again. i saw it soar the skies and made a mental note to give it a proper treat next time. dassyra leaned on me and pointed in the direction of the cascade. “fire vines in that direction.” i struggled to make the words leave my mouth but eventually, i managed. “godspeed.” the edge of the valley was an almost vertical wall of white rock that raised several meters up the sky. from the top, a stream of water formed an arch just to land into a deep pond probably formed by years and years of erosion. other than the waterfall, small trickles of water fell along the stone wall and formed small silvery streams that joined the creek down the slope. i had a heated discussion with dassyra because she wanted to help me with the harvesting. i was stalwart, she was wounded and lacked my cheat skills that let me harvest the right ingredients. finally, after appealing to a whole litany of arguments, the orc woman agreed to let me do the dirty work. “if a stray monster appears and something happens to you, the caretaker is going to kill me.” dassyra said as she slowly walked behind me. “she told me a whole lot about you.” “if you still tried to kill me, then elincia must not like me a lot.” i replied. “oh, don’t worry about that. she adores you.” i had to endure the impulse of looking over my shoulder to see if dassyra was joking and focused on the fire vines in front of me. the plants seemed to like humid places with lots of disponible water because they grew in dense clumps around the small streams of water. i used \[identify\]. **fire vine. \[identify\]: rare plant that gathers fire mana from the environment. if mature enough, its pods can ignite dried plants. grows in humid locations to avoid starting fires. alchemy ingredient.** was i going to bring great amounts of a potentially explosive plant into a manor mostly made of wood and full of cute orphans? i sighed. experimentation would have to wait. “the caretaker told me how you appeared out of nowhere, acted like a damn maniac, and fixed most of the orphanage's problems.” dassyra continued speaking. wolf must have inherited his reserved personality from his father. “we are yet to solve the orphanage's biggest problems.” i replied, trying to dismiss the part i played in the orphanage's current situation. stable but at the edge of the precipice. “you are quite similar to byrne-samuel, rob. are all men from your country that prone to fixing people's issues?” dassyra asked. “there are lots of kinds of men back at home, but i guess it is generally expected from us to fix stuff.” i replied as i shrugged my shoulders. “household appliances mostly.” i didn't expect dassyra to understand my joke. back at the orphanage my jokes usually went over elincia's head and got me only confused looks. however, dassyra laughed heartily. “you know what house appliances are?” i asked, shocked. “of course i do. i had byrne locked in a cage answering my questions for a week before i could convince the elders to let him go. he did enter our territory without permission after all.” dassyra said with a smug expression. “i kind of wish we had vacuum cleaners in this world.” “vacuum cleaners are great.” i replied. i walked along the stone wall, searching for more fire vines among the ferns and brambles, with dassyra glued to my heels. i never suspected the amounts of enjoyment a conversation about electric appliances and small modern commodities could give me. despite having green skin, ivory tusks, and arms strong as trees, having a conversation with dassyra felt like interacting with someone from my own world. over our heads, the changeling drew wide circles in its avian form. “what happened to byrne?” i asked as our talk about soda flavors died. a search for the man had taken me into this world so i was curious about his whereabouts. if i managed to find him i could dispel a lot of doubts regarding the system and the origin of the portal between our worlds. “i don't know. he liked to investigate things, he traveled to farcrest every other month and met with the previous caretaker to discuss whatever he was researching at that moment. one day, when i was away patrolling the northern frontier, he went to farcrest without an escort and he never came back. the farlands are unforgiving, so he may as well be dead.” dassyra replied. i didn’t want to hint that he could’ve just abandoned her so i pushed the conversation in another direction. as much as i wanted to figure out what byrne knew, i was more worried about wolf. a dead parent wasn’t trivial for a teenager kid. “and wolf knows this?” i asked. “yes. wolf quickly realized he’s not a pureblood orc. human kids are weak compared to orc kids so… i had to tell them. he took it well, all things considered.” dassyra explained. “don't get me wrong. half orcs are welcome in our towns, they are kin to us. however, most of them choose to accept the system and live among humans. ongo and risha were raised with the old caretaker and they both decided to not return.” risha. elincia's best friend had been a half orc from dassyra's people. i didn't know how to feel about elincia keeping it a secret from me. i shook my head knowing that i wasn't the one to complain considering the amount of lies i keep telling her. i pushed those ideas to the side. “has wolf mentioned something about coming back to the farlands with us?” dassyra asked with a shy tone and i understood how hard it had been for her to ask the question. “wolf hasn't said anything about returning with the orcs, but he has not mentioned anything about staying with us humans.” i replied. “in fact, he rarely speaks about himself. he's worryingly stoic for his age.” dassyra laughed again and the tension of the moment disappeared. “it's good to hear he hasn't forgotten how to be a true orc.” the woman smiled. “what else? does he have a fiance yet?” my brain took a moment to click. people were considered adults with merely fifteen years in this world. i shook my head. “isn’t he too young for marriage?” i asked. “now you are talking like a worried mother.” dassyra laughed. “what about a girlfriend, then?” i didn’t know what the orphanage's dating policy was but i knew for a fact that a lot of schools forbid teens from dating. not that it worked anyway. i made a mental note to ask elincia if she had 'the talk' with the older kids, the last thing we needed was an unplanned pregnancy. “as far as i know, wolf doesn't have a girlfriend. but again, keeping secrets from parents and teachers is definitely a teenager thing.” i said, prompting another laugh from dassyra. now that we were talking in english, she didn't seem as stoic as before. “wolf is mostly reserved. he never complains about anything and he's very diligent with training. the other kids respect him and, for some reason, the younger children like him a lot despite wolf's attempts at ignoring them. i think they know wolf is kind inside.” i said. dassyra nodded with a satisfied expression. “is he strong like us?” she shyly asked as if she was talking about something frowned upon. “he's stronger than the other kids, probably stronger than an adult man but not a lot more than that.” i replied, sensing that there was a strong correlation between the amount of strength and the likelihood of wolf coming back to join orc society. dassyra kneeled by my side and examined one of the smaller vine pods. all the questions about byrne’s discovery of the magic portal left my mind as we continued talking about wolf. “do you want me to speak with him about returning with your people?” i asked but dassyra instantly shook her head. “no. wolf's almost an adult now. half-orcs have to make their own decisions, that's our law.” she replied. “wolf is a kid.” “byrne-samuel used to say the same all the time.” dassyra smiled just to continue mimicking byrne's voice. “how dare you take twelve years old to fight black wolves?! kids that age belong in a classroom! half of you orcs are savages, and the other half are brutes!” dassyra's expression suddenly became melancholic. “listen, dassyra, maybe wolf don't have to live with humans.” i said, picking dassyra's attention. “the marquis will conscript the kids as soon as the winter ends. if you take them under your protection, they might have better chances to survive and wolf will return home like you would want him to.” dassyra stopped picking small fiery vine pods and looked at me. “the caretaker already asked me, and the answer was no.” she replied with a stone face. “why not?! he's your son!” as far as i knew the orc woman, she didn't seem irrational nor cruel like the depiction of orcs from classic fantasy series back home. “they would be safer fighting in the human army, rob. think about it. i can present the kids to the elders, but they will not be accepted if they use the system. we don't deal with the corruption, ever. even in the case they reject the system, they will have to fight anyway, every orc in the farlands has to fight for our kin to survive.” she harshly replied. “do you think the gnome girl will survive a fight against a black wolf or even a minor slime without the help of the system?” i opened my mouth to reply but i couldn't find any counterargument to dassyra's words. “you are a lot like byrne-samuel. you have a peaceful view of the world, and you want that for others. but things are just too different here. for one reason or another we have to fight. this is a dangerous world, rob. only the strong survive and no amount of pity you feel for the caretaker is going to change that.” the silence fell upon the valley, only interrupted by the constant singing of the waterfall against the stone wall. “i don't feel pity for elincia.” i finally said. “i do believe she would manage even without my help. she's a great woman; strong, caring, smart, compassionate. i'm not fighting for the orphanage because i pity them, i'm fighting this fight because i admire her, because i want to be more like her.” my words got lost under the sound of the cascade as if i never uttered them, however, something changed inside me. a realization. i wasn't helping elincia and the orphanage only to repay my father's commitment. i was fighting for the orphanage because i wanted to be more like him. i wanted to be a better person. more like elincia. i covered my face with both hands. even if the difference was minimal, it meant a world to me. dassyra examined me with a critical eye, as if she was sizing me, before speaking. “very few people would say something like that.” dassyra smiled tiredly. “most of the orcs, young and old wouldn't even look in a poor governess' direction and say 'i want to be more like her'. they would look at a freaking wendigo and say 'yeah, i want to be strong like that'. this goes for you system users too. all they look for are more levels and powerful classes. nobody looks up to the common farmer but everyone has to eat their grain to survive.” dassyra put both her hands on my shoulders and forced me to face her before she continued speaking. “maybe byrne-samuel was wrong about the peoples from earth. maybe you are not half as cruel and destructive as he pictured..” dassyra said. “maybe.” i replied and she let me go. i worked my way through the vines covering the stone wall until i managed to gather a pouch full of the red pods. considering the amounts of herbs elincia used to brew, i assumed it was more than enough for quite some time. dassyra walked by my side in silence. i let \[identify\] and \[awareness\] scan the surroundings and soon after i found the remaining moon laurel that i needed to complete my shopping list. after an hour, i wiped off my hands on my pants and stretched my back. we already had all the ingredients we needed to start making money. a wave of relief washed over my body and my muscles released tension i didn't even know i had stored. now, we only needed to come back to bring the ingredients back to farcrest, just like in the initial missions of rpg games. go to the forest, retrieve ten herbs. easy as it goes. dassyra guided me back to the cascade but instead of returning to the orc outpost, she took off her boots and dipped her feet into the creek. “if your feet are as bruised as mine, this will help you.” the woman said as a blissful expression overran her face. “and you have to bring me up to date with earth affairs. my last update was fourteen years ago and i have to know what happened with the game of thrones finale.” my heart skipped a beat. last time i had seen byrne was five years ago at the office while dassyra had seen him for the last time fourteen years ago. the timing wasn’t right unless time passed at different rates in this world. maybe byrne just gave up this world and came back to earth. i wanted to voice my concerns but giving dassyra a false hope of byrne being alive and well left a foul taste in my mouth. in the end, i sighed and got rid of my boots. footwear had been an issue since i had exchanged my comfy shoes with the bean seller. i did not regret the exchange, the orphanage needed the food and beans were god-tier nourishment, secondary effects aside. however, my boots were as uncomfortable as they were sturdy. i left the herb pouch by a rock near the creek, then i rolled up my pants and jumped into the pristine water. despite the fact i had drank it only a couple hours earlier, i didn't expect it to be that cold. my feet complained about the sudden change of temperature but after a minute i got accustomed to it. just as dassyra said, it felt great. we sat side by side on the riverbank. a part of my brain was telling me to rush back to the orc's camp and return to farcrest but i felt tired, my back was killing me, and the idea of talking in my native tongue was enticing. there was still so much i wanted to ask, but my mind felt numb and the only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the cold water running between my toes. “did byrne use the system?” i finally asked. if byrne had a class and she told dassyra about our world, then that meant the warning about keeping it a secret was just a suggestion without a threat behind it. seeing dassyra's interest in my world made me want to share it with elincia without the risk of being punished by the system. moreso, it would support my theory of byrne coming back to earth. before dassyra could answer my question, a stinging pain sent an electric pain through my feet. my mind pictured a piranha munching on my toes so i reflexively pulled out of the water. what i didn't expect to see were ice crystals forming all over my feet. it was magic. dassyra jumped out of the water at the same time as me. “we have to get back to the outpost, quickly.” over the peaks of the mountains, a dense mist started to saturate and slip into the valley. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [first]( | [prev]( | [next]( | next \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

hope you slept alright!” she whistled, high ears and beaming eyes on me as she pulled her steaming bowl over to her. “day warms you both, i hope you’re ready for your first real paw with *polani!*” “lord knows i am. got a load of produce to haul from the port off to the capitol and then some heavier freight they want us to drop off in dawn creek before bringing a small shipment to hidden plains on the way home.” chris mumbled around his food, the low growling rumble of his voice not even phasing me anymore. “i’m willing to bet i know what that last shipment is, door denter.” taisa whistled, sticking her tongue out as she bumped her shoulder into his side. “lemme guess, not gonna tell me?” “nooope! you’ve got a bright star, i’m sure you can figure it out!” “you and your guessing games. gonna drive me nuts, wool ball.” he joked, a soft smile on his face as he gently returned the bump. “well don’t you two go guessing so much you forget you’ve got *our* shipment to your ma’s friends back on earth ready for next paw. rensa and i intend to spend *ours* getting it ready for you to take.” i whistled, pointing my tail at the two of them before popping a piece of melroot in my mouth amongst hurried assurances they wouldn’t forget. the soft give of the cooked melroot in my first-meal gave a satisfying squish as i chewed at it, watching the pair chatter back and forth as i savored the food’s warmth. rensa’s claws clicked and her leg thumped down the stairs, recieving a chorus of greetings as she took her tea and nuzzled my snout before taking a long sip before starting in on her first-meal. chris looked down to taisa, a broad smile on his face, her ears high and happy with her tail wound tightly around his leg. *like rensa and i when we were younger.* i flicked my ears, dashing off the thought. as good a pair of friends as they were i couldn’t imagine them *together!* chris is a good man, certainly been nothing *but* helpful since she’d brought him back from the exchange, but still; human and a venlil wouldn’t - *couldn’t* \- work… right? **---** **memory transcription subject: taisa, venlil starship engineer, venlil-human exchange participant** date \[standardized human time\]: september 15th, 2136 “parnel, you old groben! what’ve you got for me?” i whistled, matching the tone of the welcome whistle above my head. the old graying venlil looked up from his papers spread on the counter, the tip of his grease stained tail twitching with amusement as he returned the greeting with a note of mischief in his voice. “well if it isn’t my favorite wool-oil! come to see what i’ve got in stock? or are we lookin’ for something a little more *specific*?” “oh you *know* what i’m here for! how’s that m600hc coming along?” “it’s getting there, not sure how i’m going to get it from *there* to ***here*** but i’m working on it.” he sighed, shuffling his papers together before looking back up at me. “but that’s a chat for another time. for now though i *did* secure it, and at a stars-*blessed* deal!” “almost makes you wonder why she got **\[translator error: human cultural context missing\]** in the first place.” “why she got what?” i raised my ear in question, tilting my head. “been a while since we hit an error.” “**\[translator error: human cultural context missing\]**? oh, uh. laid up, stricken from the registry, put out of service. why she was even available for you to get in the first place.” “ah, based on the conversation i had with the seller she had an… *accident.*” he replied, sifting through the papers again so he could read one. my ear swiveled off of chris, refocusing on parnel. “what *kind* of accident?” “she got attacked by the arxur; starboard hull is ripped open like a popped can of sprunk. a slug punched through and burst a pressurized tank.” he mumbled, running a paw up the wool of his snout. “crew managed to get away with all paws but, well, she’s never getting through atmo under her own power ever again, and i don’t plan on picking parts from a crater.” “at least they’re alright. what’s that mean for us pulling parts off her? kinda hard to bring a hull down without her bein’ able to control her own descent.” chris rumbled, leaning an elbow down on the counter as he tried to make crown from tail of the papers parnel had spread out. “talking with a salvage company right now, they said they’ve ‘got a plan’ but i’m far from trusting of contractors, *especially* new ones.” he sighed before fixing an eye and ear on me as chris nodded. “this all is going to cost me a pretty credit, so no digging around the crop on me, taisa. you know i won’t burn ya but a man’s gotta make a livin’!” “i’ll behave when it's here. so long as you give me fair prices we’ll be *just* fine.” i softly chuckled, jokingly poking a claw his direction before rifling through the papers and pulling out the listing he’d printed out so i could show it to chris and tell him what it said. “have i ever done ya wrong, taisa?” he laughed, that same hitching whistle i’d come to know so well. i tapped a claw on the side of my jaw, a mischievous twist in my tail as i answered. “well there was that *one* time…” “oh *predator shit!*” he hesitated a moment, flicking his ears in apology to chris before continuing. “i didn’t know that condenser was bad and you know it!” “i know, i know. just pullin’ your tail! we’ve got to oversee some freight on-boarding at the star-port, so we’ll get out of your wool, *for now*. have a good paw parnel!” he waved his tail to us as we departed, calling after us. “you two as well! always good to see you taisa, don’t be a stranger!” **\[\[advance memory transcription time unit: 5 hours\]** “*stars* that took a long time. they just *had* to send us the most skittish receiver in the capitol; they **ordered** the brahking thing so they should have seen ‘human’ under the captain! and that *loader!!!* they’d clearly never operated a grav-lift before!” i huffed, plopping down into my seat as chris coaxed *polani’s* ion thrusters to life. “might’ve been new. ‘sides, did you see how crowded those pads were? far cry from a few weeks ago when we started.” he rumbled back, pulling us up into the open sky on our exit route as i looked over polani’s sensors. “yea, but only a few of those are merchant vessels. something is happening out there.” i whined, gently grasping my tail with one paw as i looked down at the ships below. venlil navy ships, old and new, sat in that all to familiar pristine white and black livery with the u.n.’s symbol adorning their hulls. “well let’s cross our fingers and hope they don’t drag us into whatever it is. i’m more than happy to run freight and make money over sticking our necks out any day of the week.” he sighed, guiding the nose toward dawn creek once again. i nodded in agreement, as much as i resented that every other species in the federation called us weak; i didn’t want to fight anyone, certainly not the grays. mama’d had me use her old rifle a few times, trying her best to make it so i could help a little more on the farm. i was an alright shot but certainly nothing special. and certainly no warrior. for them though… for **him.** i glanced over at him, his visor off and gleaming on top of the console in front of him as he brought polani up to speed. the sun shone across his hair, kind eyes and warm features flitting over to meet my gaze before giving me a soft, happy smile. you’d do a **lot** for him. i tried to return the gesture, pulling my mouth back and curling my lips up and away from my teeth while my wail waved happily behind me; chris’ reaction, however, told me i was rather short of the count. “good try, tai. needs a little work but you’ll get there.” he laughed, reaching over to gently scratch my ear. “now, how about we go pick up this ‘package’ at dawn creek you still refuse to tell me ‘bout.” “well now i certainly can’t spoil the surprise!” i whistled back, poking his side gently. “i’m still pretty sure i was right that it’s new parts and you just don’t wanna say it.” “you’ll see soon enough, nosy dulbet.” i responded, sticking my tongue out a little, receiving the same in kind. chris banked us over, following a tailwind high in-atmo as we made our run. having a ship that was actually comfortable in a transatmospheric zone was a treat compared to shamrock. cut a journey that would’ve taken us two thirds of a claw down to a quarter, although i knew we both sorely missed the views. not to say this wasn’t something special, the expanse of vp below looked like a swath of turquoise fabric stretched tight across an old bed. little dots and wavering lines of azure blue and deep shimmering black marked their way across the surface, tracing rivers, lakes and ponds far below. in the distance i saw the rise of a city, coming around the horizon as chris nosed down, starting our deceleration burns as the skyline grew below us. he reached forward, tripping the hail and calling the tower. “dawn creek shuttle field 15-alpha this is vp-2865-hr on approach, requesting clearance for landing at available cargo pad of convenience for load and unload of cargo.” “-2865-hr you are clear for landing, 15-alpha, to pad charlie-16.” “-2865-hr to charlie-16, copy.” the city’s star-port grew, an ugly gray scar of concrete surrounded by industrial buildings cutting off the rolling fields and forests at its edge like a line in the sand. chris leveled us off, swinging the ship around to make an easy landing. the crackling roar of the thrusters mixed with the heavy thrum of hydraulics pushing out our landing gear before the soft thump of the pad below rose to meet us and the ever-increasingly talkative ship added more to my harvest-list. “still not tellin’?” the high lilt in his voice undercut by that heavy resonance sung through and around the helm. that familiar voice now like an engine’s hum to my ears and heart while i saw a small smile pull at his lips as he reached forward to snag his visor. “you have minutes if not seconds before you find out; you’ve made it this far so i'm sure you’ll last, door denter.” i whistled, beckoning him with my tail as i passed. “come on, wouldn’t wanna keep our cargo waiting, would we?” he let out an exaggerated huff before the heavy thump of his boots followed me out of the helm and towards the cargo bay. it was astounding just how much could fit in her: rows and rows of towering columns of standard cargo crates filled the hold near to the roof. what was even more astounding was how much we got paid for the first trail of the trip; our account had jumped twenty five percent from just one run, not even a full paw’s work! i was sure that enthusiasm would diminish when we got our fuel bill, but for now, my wool loved the breeze! “hopefully these guys can offload and unload faster than the last ones.” chris mumbled as he stepped up beside me, running a hand through my wool and scratching at my ears before sending the ramp down with his pad. “hate to be stuck here another few hours. especially if these ones end up bein’ scared of humans; i don’ wanna end up like that blue texan we saw on the news.” “i’m sure it’ll be fine, loading should go down as easy as shadeberry gin, my towering heartwood.” i purred, tapping his side with my tail before wrapping it around his wrist for a moment, squeezing tightly at the name i had given him. “besides, at worst ya just end up taking a nap while i keep an ear on them.” *as much as i’d rather be with you for that*. “you make a pretty convincing case there, darlin'.” he sighed, giving my ears one last scratch before walking down the ramp. i spotted our cargo standing below us at the base of the ramp: a familiar trio, plus one gojid. in an exterminator’s uniform. *well that can’t be good. hopefully they didn’t get themselves in any trouble.* i waved my tail in greeting, letting out a happy whistle as i did. “day warms you three! it’s good to see you again, we heard someone needed a ride home! although i don’t know if we’ll have room for any *extra* passengers!” the taller figure draped in white stood straight, before calling out, “taisa?!” my tail waved faster as i bleated across the open space, “yep! sam sent us a message last paw!” the two venlil with her visibly relaxed, while the gojid behind them tightened up a little when he saw chris’s towering form, quills flaring out as his ears flapped in confusion. he almost looked *familiar*, though i couldn’t quite put my claw on it… though maeve’s happy squeal interrupted my recollection, “this is *incredible*!! it’s so amazing to see you two; we have so much to tell you!” “well we’ll be happy to hear it, just gotta drop-n-grab some freight then we can bring you aboard..” chris rumbled, his posture easing with the venlil as he beckoned the herd of laborers with grav-lifts over to us. “with any luck, these guys will get the *polani* loaded up faster than the last crew.” “*polani*?” the gojid asked quietly as his sight drifted up to the painted tail-tag, “you guys out of heartwood?” i bobbed my tail, swinging my ears to him to give him my attention. “i grew up there. stars know the port’s a whole lot more quiet than anywhere else.” the gojid huffed out a laugh, their ears swinging genially. “don’t i know it! been almost **\[ 15 solar years \]** but i won’t soon forget wandering that damn port looking for someone to take my gear to the office.” valek’s tail swung a greeting. “this is ulmic, he was assigned to escort us to the star-port.” “give me a *little* credit, pup; i volunteered."" valek’s tail flicked in mischief while alvi beside him bapped his snout with her own. i brought my attention back to the gojid as chris and i reached the bottom of the ramp, chris guiding the lot of us out of the way of work, “your gear? did you *work* in heartwood?” “work *related*. i was fielding offices to try and showcase some more effective flamers; heard a few of your officers were looking to clear predators a bit… *faster* than average.” their attention shifted across the loading crew as they appeared to choose their words. i nodded, gesturing the ground crew past us and up the ramp, chris quickly signing the presented pad before handing it back to an outstretched paw. “my mama and one of her coworkers, shenod, probably. unless it was after she retired.” their attention snapped back to me, their sight lingering on my spots for a moment. “mama? you’re rensa’s girl?” a memory crossed my mind, mama speaking with a gojid *other* than salamar in town one paw. “i am! she’s doing well, outside of the leg of course.” his ears fell sympathetically; chris guided us to the side as a larger haul was loaded on. “good to hear she is doing well.” he sighed a little, looking up at the tail-tag again. “say, that festival of yours should be coming up, shouldn’t it?” “that it is.” chris rumbled, checking boxes on our ship pad as he watched the lines of crates carted on and off the ship. “already got a handful of ‘threats’ from her parents about making it back on time.” “oh they’re just messing with you; they know we wouldn’t miss it for the world.” i whistled, poking him in the side with my claw before wrapping my tail around his leg. “besides, bring back some new produce from earth for mama and i bet she’ll let a claw or two slide.” he chuckled, rubbing at the wool on my crown before marking off another rack of crates. “we’ll have to remember that. i'm sure ma’ll let us bring a basket or two home from her garden.” “maybe if you bring one back for the *entire* office you’ll keep farzen and marlek off our tails.” the gojid rolled a deep grumble as their tail thumped behind them, “those two idiots are still in silver? i’m none too fond of your kind, human, but you shouldn't have to deal with brapic like them; protector knows we got enough of that in dawn creek. i’m disappointed that heartwood’s hospitality was so lacking.” chris belted out a laugh, shaking his head. “thankfully we haven’t been introduced, but their reputation sure as shit precedes them. no, everyone i’ve met in heartwood that hasn’t been welcoming has either been skittish, rude or just dismissive. i’ve had worse, sure, but i don’t think i could have had a *better* reception than what heartwood has given me; nah, heartwood’s hospitality is just fine.” ulmic stared at the tail tag for a long moment, grumbling a long *hmm* before he straightened and took a deep breath, “well if you don’t mind, i have an office to… *handle*. i have a short form for the captain to sign, but…” his ears flashed to chris for a moment, “all things considered i think the captain’s second would be fine in their *absence*.” he reached out, offering me a short form confirming i had received ‘pd patients for treatment’. “sure, let’s get you on your way.” i beeped as i took the form, quickly skimming through the document before signing and returning it. “pd patients, huh? stars, what'd the three of *you* get up to?!” valek’s wool flared as he glared at ulmic, while alvi seemed to shrink at the mention. ulmic waved off the question and answered quickly. “regrettably they didn’t have a form for ‘diplomatic escort’, so it was between this and ‘predator disposal’. use the quills you got, right?” ulmic took the completed form and turned away, watching the trio in their periphery, “i’d tell you to stay out of trouble maeve, but you didn’t seem to listen. at least try to stay out of the news, eh?” the bundle of white called back over their shoulder, “no promises!” before turning back to us. chris had just finished signing the final manifest as the work-herd filed out of the hold before turning to the trio. “alright, let’s get y’all situated, you can chill in the crew quarters or the galley during the flight; gonna be an extra-atmo hop so shouldn’t be more than a few hours, little less than a claw. maeve, you can lose that get-up once we’re inside, we’re all friends here.” the two venlil walked behind chris as he led us up the ship, while maeve collected her travel bag and matched my stride. “you mentioned the festival last time, is it really so close?” “just over the hill! shouldn’t be more than three or four paws now, we’re gonna spend a ‘day’ or two with chris’ family while he finds stuff to ship back with us and reaches out to some of his old contacts. i’m… excited?” maeve tilted her head under her veil. “excited? to come to earth? you’re one brave venlil!” i gently grasped my tail, softly kneading at the wool of my tuft before murmuring my answer. “it’s… there’s a few reasons: he keeps raving about his ma’s ‘vegan cooking’, those *astounding* views he’s showed me in pictures, the money’s good, i’ll be doing what i’ve always dreamed of… and it’s, well it’s important to him, so it’s important to me. hopefully i can get past the *dog* though.” i shuddered, quickly smoothing out my snout wool and giving my head a shake. maeve watched the light disappear as the ramp closed, removing her veil to bundle it in her bag the moment it did. “i’m sure you’ll be fine. i’m sure it’s well-behaved, but just in case it isn’t: try not to run, especially if it comes up to sniff ya, that’s just how dogs get familiar.” “c’mon, woolball, you’ll be fine. pa does a good job trainin’ his pups. ‘sides, i won’t let ‘em hurt ya if’n they get excited anyhow.” chris rumbled, giving me a reassuring smile over his shoulder as he secured the cargo ramp for extra-atmo flight. “we’ll be there and having a good time ‘fore ya know it and then right back here for the festival!” i sighed, wrapping my tail around his wrist and tightening gently before he pulled away. “i know, just worrying is all. not my fault you lot keep predators that set my wool on end as pets!” “you said they were ‘kinda cute’ on the station!” “yea but that wasn’t with the prospect of *meeting* one in a few paws! and you kept showing me the videos of them being just as goofy as you, door denter!” i bleated back, jabbing a claw up at him, earning a rolling belly laugh as he started walking towards the helm, leading us forward. valek scampered after him with alvi close behind, tails curling with curiosity as valek launched into a barrage of questions about dogs. chris answered as fast as they came, his responses resonating off the walls of the corridors as he answering question after question with a happy smile and kind words. i sighed, watching the pair converse as alvi listened on attentively before finally working up the courage to ask one of her own. “h-how do dogs help your doctors? what would they know about disease?” “a few ways. can train ‘em to pick up on some health problems, help with anxiety or mental health or just… just helping people who need friends. they love doin’ it too, workin’ dogs are never happier than when they’re doin’ their jobs!” my tail swayed about behind me, betraying my attempts at hiding my adoration as i watched him answer. a soft purring sigh slipped from my snout as we walked, earning a glance from maeve. her words were quiet on the tail of my perception, “chris is so… *gentle*, isn’t he?” i nodded, one ear swiveling to her as i watched the trio in front of us. “y-yea, warm too. stars know he brightens my every waking moment.” i watched the trio round the corner, trailing slowly after them as maeve walked with me. once they were out of sight, she asked, “so… does he know yet?” i froze, a bloom racing up my snout and ears as i fixed her with one eye before my mouth bolted off. “uh… y-yea, yea he does. we had that conversation last paw, actually. it was… nice.” *stars, that was fast.* \--- [first]( | [prev.]( | [next](",NatureofPredators,letter of marque - a nop fanfic 41,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/16p81o9/letter_of_marque_a_nop_fanfic_41/,0

[foto fra værthus ]( *det beviser min påstand om den såkaldte ""frikendelse""* jeg gik fra at være på de sociale medier dagligt, til at holde mig helt fra drama grupper m.fl. i flere år, takket være den, som stadig i dag blaimer for dine elendigheder, så uansvarlig som du er! da jeg kom på tiktok i 2023, valgte jeg at se alle mennesker med friske øjne, pga. ny livserfaring, og dermed gav jeg også dig en ny chance, for at se om din adfærd ændrede sig. jeg begyndte at se et mønster, og støttede blindt et menneske igen, noget som jeg havde lovet mig selv ikke at gøre, og det var både naivt og skammeligt af mig. jeg vil gerne slå fast en gang for alle, for at skyde alle rygter til jorden. **- jeg har aldrig boet hos malene sandgaard** **- jeg har aldrig været en del af “sekten” som det bliver kaldt her på reddit** **homofobi** i din jagt på at ramme mig personligt, vælger du at træde en hel gruppe af mennesker med store støvler. vi lever i år 2023, hvor det at være andet en heteroseksuel, ikke længere skal ses ned på. heldigvis er mine skuldre så brede, at ordet “bøsserøv” ikke påvirker mig, men blot får dig selv til at fremstå som hadsk menneske. din åbenlyse homofobiske adfærd, kommer du heldigvis selv til at stå på mål for, og jeg kan kun smile over, at min seksualitet har så stor en betydning for dig, som menneske der ikke har en personlig relation til mig (og aldrig kommer til at have det) **manglende billeder af mig selv** fra dagen jeg startede på tiktok lavede jeg en aftale med mig selv om at jeg ikke ville gå på kamera, netop for at undgå udstilling. jeg gjorde min facebook privat, så kun mine venner har adgang til den, igen for at undgå udstilling af mine privat billeder bare det at du kommenterer på, at man ikke kan se billeder af mig, beviser for mig at jeg netop tog det rette valg at ikke dele den del af mig selv. **min eks** *""det kunne være, hans ekskæreste skulle have givet ham nogle flere tæsk"" - malene sandgaard* det er helt korrekt, at jeg har en ekskæreste, som ikke har behandlet mig specielt pænt, hvilket inkluderer psykisk og fysisk vold. det har sat nogle ar på sjælen, som jeg arbejder med hver eneste dag for at hele, og jeg er så pavestolt over den lange vej, jeg er kommet med mig selv. partnervold er ikke noget som skal negligeres eller koges ned til et “ømt punkt” man kan bruge mod et andet menneske for at få dem ned med nakken. det er modbydeligt. jeg har af gode grunde valgt ikke at dele de mest personlige oplysninger omkring dette emne, netop af frygt for at det skulle kastes tilbage i hovedet på mig. en handling, som jeg desværre blev budt med, og kun er blevet klogere af. samtidig vil jeg udnytte muligheden til at fortælle til andre, der sidder eller har siddet i lignende situationer. du er ikke alene! “lev uden vold” har en hotline på tlf. 1888, som man kan ringe til døgnet rundt. ingen mennesker fortjener at leve i et forhold, hvor vold foregår. **de manglende tænder** igen er der meget fokus på mit udseende. jeg er en 2 meter høj mand, med lidt for mange kilo på sidebenene, men heldigvis relativt sund og rask. det er åbenbart blevet en ting at mine tænder skal nævnes, og derfor vil jeg lige for en god ordens skyld fortælle om den del af historien som malene af gode grunde undlader at fortælle i sin jagt på at udstille mig. det er ingen hemmelighed, at jeg for nogle år siden var kræftsyg, og derfor modtog kemoterapi. kemoterapi er en meget heftig omgang medicin, som desværre har mange skadende effekter på kroppen (også flere år efter endt behandling) og desværre i mit tilfælde gjorde det, at nerverne i min kæbe tog skade, hvilket medførte smuldrende tænder, samt store smerter i kæben. det gør, at jeg den dag i dag, kan se frem til en protese, ikke af kosmetiske grunde, men sundhedsmæssige grunde, hvilket du godt vidste eftersom jeg havde fortalt dig det. men det var vigtigere for dig, at få mig til at fremstå som en “bums” der ikke kunne passe på sine tænder. det lykkedes dig desværre bare ikke. afslutningsvis, vil jeg sige at jeg håber du en dag får øjnene op for dit spor af uvenskaber som du har efterladt dig gennem livet, og måske en dag finder indsigten til at arbejde med dig selv. wasa / knækbrødet.",tiktokdramadk,offentlig tilkendegivelse og afstandstagen til sandgaard.,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/tiktokdramadk/comments/15r398v/offentlig_tilkendegivelse_og_afstandstagen_til/,0

(but he didn't pay nedry enough.. just like hogwarts doesn't pay its staff enough. that's asking for trouble, yo!) * it's supposed to have been built around the same time of the earliest stone castles in europe. it ought to look and feel more like the few mostly-intact examples we still have, such as the [chamber of the pyx]( at westminster abbey. i'd prefer to see a hogwarts that is all rugged stone with nods to norman or more ancient scottish architecture. hogwarts ought to be more quintessentially british than french - or more accurately, more quintessentially scottish. as a building that is supposed to be the safest place for... anything apparently it ought to reflect that a bit more than the film version did. not quite as solid as the 11th century [st. george tower]( but you know.. something in that sort of direction. the magical community of the british isles sent their children there, their future. they were vulnerable as children always are, but even more so since they were the progeny of a hated and hunted minority. the magical community of the middle ages wouldn't have taken any chances. (yes, i know the magic is what ultimately protects them, but i don't think parents who fear for their children's safety would choose a pretty building over a rock-solid one. this is one reason why modern schools look an awful lot like prisons. that and they don't have money for fancy stonework.. just like hogwarts.) i also don't think they need to go as far as the style of [braemar castle]( but i admit i'm biased toward that particular structure since it was once owned by my ancestral clan, farquharson. (til that they also owned [balmoral castle]( up until prince albert purchased it for queen victoria!) i wouldn't be mad if hogwarts looked a little bit like the balmoral in that painting either. ultimately, the juxtaposition of impoverished characters like the weasleys, lupin, and others against the ""spared no expense""-ness of hogwarts castle doesn't feel right. i know the author is disturbingly conservative even though she lived through poverty herself, but if families like the weasleys need to tighten their belts just to afford school supplies, and if the likes of malfoy can throw their weight around in governing the school, that's a pretty clear indication that hogwarts doesn't have a lot of wealth. it doesn't make sense for it to look like that. so, give me a less fancy structure with fewer ornamental windows and such, and let the fascinating, storied, hoarded collection of portraits, tapestries, statues, and suits of armor do all the talking (literally) to make a fucking *magical boarding school* inside an ancient fucking *castle* an incredibly cool place to be. it doesn't need to be a constant feast for the eyes, the *concept* of is what fascinates. &#x200b; oh, and plea #2 for the series? can magical effects like statues and staircases moving, secret chamber doors opening and the like stop being treated as if there are actual physical mechanisms involved? there's no reason why the movement shouldn't be completely smooth and noiseless. it's magic goddamnit. &#x200b; &#x200b;",harrypotter,"hogwarts, the castle itself.",0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/16es8kt/hogwarts_the_castle_itself/,0
