15w0atz,1692502455,how to diy an air purifier to filter smoke,"if you are in kelowna or west kelowna and struggling to find an air purifier or just cant afford one, there is an easy diy solution. if you have a window ac unit, floor (portable, with tubes) ac unit, or even an old box fan, all you need is a furnace filter. i used one of these: [ this is similar to the corsi-rosenthal box concept created during the covid 19 pandemic, however it only uses one filter instead of 4 and uses equipment that many people already have. i don't know many people who have box fans, but i know countless people with portable/window ac units. the boxes are undoubtedly better, but this still works and is much cheaper and easier to make. simply pick a filter that fits your ac's interior air intake closely in one dimension, and then cut it to size in the other dimension. in this case a 16 inch wide filter fit my unit perfectly, i just had to cut it in half to fit the vertical dimension. then, making sure you align the airflow direction arrow correctly (these are directional filters) tape it to the unit with whatever you have. i used some aluminium tape because i wanted to do a fairly neat job, but you can use duct tape, electrical tape, or anything else that will hold it on. the suction will pull the filter against the unit, you just want to seal off as many gaps as possible so that most of the air goes through the filter. you can usually get two uses out of a single filter, so it's cost effective, with the filters usually costing $20-$30 each. i usually have to replace them during smoke season once per month, your mileage may vary depending on your ac. mine is a 12,000 btu toshiba unit from 2019, and does an excellent job of moving lots of air, and in my experience has beat out a $250 danby purifier with one of these filters. you can also do this with an industrial box fan that can be purchased for cheap at most hardware stores and are normally not in super high demand as they are large and can be loud, so find one that is bearable for you and accept the tradeoff of a bit more noise for cleaner air. you can always run it during the day when you are away from home and turn it off when you get back, it'll still filter a lot of air in that time. keep in mind if your ac has an especially weak fan, this may not work super well, and may trip the machine's circuit protection, causing it to pulse the fan. i've had this happen with another machine, and the solution was to leave a gap at the edges, after which it worked fine and still managed to turn the filter entirely dark brown after the fire season in 2021 so it did obviously still did something. stay safe out there, and my sincerest condolences to those who have lost properties to the fire. stay strong kelowna",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/15w0atz/how_to_diy_an_air_purifier_to_filter_smoke/

15obm6i,1691766871,can we learn anything from the hawaii wildfires? how about burying power lines?,"was just reading about the horrific wildfires in hawaii and one of the theories about how it started was that downed power lines and transformers may have started it. the fires were then fuelled by strong winds from an offshore hurricane. with kelowna being a city obviously at risk from wildfires and sometimes prone to storms, it sounds like burying our power lines could be an effective strategy to help mitigate fire risk. i know some of the more expensive real-estate streets near where i live in the mission already have buried lines, and maybe it's already policy for newer developments. but does anyone with more knowledge of this than me have any insight into the feasibility of doing it for existing overhead lines? is it already on the city's roadmap? if not, why not?",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/15obm6i/can_we_learn_anything_from_the_hawaii_wildfires/

13lgiss,1684458068,why????,"news release the city is seeking the public’s help to identify the culprits who poisoned a mature tree at 1055 sunset drive. this incident is the third of its kind within the last 12 months, excluding a separate incident involving a burnt tree on earth day. “it’s hard to understand how someone in our community would go out of their way to kill a tree like this, to drill 25 holes in it and fill them with herbicide,” says infrastructure general manager mac logan. “the city will have to recover the cost to eventually remove the tree replace it, but the idea that someone would actively choose to harm their community in this way bothers me greatly. it’s now happened for a third time in less than a year and we as a community need to stop such acts.” tragically, the poisoned tree will perish over the next two to three months and city staff will seek to preserve the tree in an effort to continue to support local wildlife until it is deemed a safety hazard and needs to be removed. previous acts of intentional vandalism targeted urban trees on manhattan drive and in the clarence greenspace area. the vandalism at clarence greenspace last summer led to the harm of more than just the initial target. due to a connected root system, six other aspen trees died as a result. in addition to the targeted poisonings, on earth day this year, the kelowna fire department responded to a fire burning in the root system of a mature tree in kelowna’s waterfront park on cedar avenue, and while extinguished, the tree was significantly damaged and had to be removed. investigations to identify individuals responsible for this latest case of vandalism are underway and we strongly encourage residents to come forward with any information they might have. anyone who may have witnessed, or has information relating to, this incident is asked to phone the kelowna rcmp at 250-762-3300 referencing file number 2023-800746. if you wish to remain anonymous, you may also contact central okanagan crime stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or leave a tip online at crimestoppers.net.",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/13lgiss/why/

15vvgac,1692488702,emergency mental health tips," as a community, we are going through what are likely some of the most harrowing days of our lives thus far. my heart goes out to everyone who is on the front lines, who has been evacuated, who is anxiously anticipating the further unfolding of events, and who is offering help to those in need. friends and neighbours, we are in this together! i am a registered clinical counsellor who lives and works in kelowna. during my masters in counselling, i did extensive research into the mental health impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. based on my research, here are a few practical tips we can use to support ourselves and each other during this truly unsettling, truly unprecedented time: 1. **connect with your community.** coming together in community is one of the best things we can do in this dire situation. if you are able, find ways to help people out by donating to support agencies, offering space in your home for evacuees, or volunteering your time. 2. **lean into relationships.** when you are able, be a support to others by reaching out, talking with them, helping them out if needed, and making yourself available. when you need support, reach out to friends, family, and loved ones. there are always people who are able to offer help and people who need assistance! 3. **talk about your feelings.** any emotional response you are having is normal and valid. if you are afraid, that is completely understandable; if you find yourself in emotional denial, that’s normal too; or if you are feeling positive, energetic, and eager to help - also a normal response! everyone’s nervous system reacts differently to emergencies. again, the best thing we can do is lean into our communities in whatever capacity we have. 4. **know whose mental health is at risk.** not everyone is at equal risk of developing adverse mental health during extreme weather events. anyone who lives in close relationship with the land is at higher risk. this includes indigenous peoples, farmers, outdoor workers, and anyone who is concerned about the environment. minority groups, individuals with a history of trauma, and individuals with already present mental health concerns are also at heightened risk. take a moment to think about who you know that falls into one of these categories; if you are able, reach out to them. 5. **be aware of long-term mental health impacts.** individuals who have past experience with traumatic events and/or extreme weather can develop longer-term mental health challenges such as acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome, or post-traumatic stress disorder. these conditions do not always develop right away; it can take up to a year or more for symptoms to emerge. don’t be afraid though - mental health struggles are treatable! be aware of symptoms associated with these challenges. if you notice symptoms developing in yourself or someone you know, reach out for professional support. also be aware that experiences of extreme weather and natural disaster can become cumulative, leaving an individual at higher risk of developing adverse mental health in the future. 6. **advocate for climate action.** human-caused climate change is making extreme weather such as wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, and floods more frequent and more severe. if you are concerned about climate change then find ways to advocate for climate action. here are some ideas: write to your elected officials, write letters to the editors of your local news outlets, join a climate advocacy group like one listed below, and talk with family, friends, and loved ones about your climate concerns. research suggests that the one of best things we can do is to use our collective anger, grief, and anxiety to fuel conversations about climate action.

166jeek,1693507658,nearing end of season personal financing,"worthiest of bros and brodettes, i am returned once again to impart some financial knowledge for your end of season. while you were all waiting for fire season (finally here) i studied the blade. big shouts out to santaclaus hotshots, saw you boys flowing north as i ripped south to go get fucked up at a wedding in napa, so happy day 5/6, get that paper. instead of blowing up this sub every couple of weeks, i decided maybe it would be better to give you totally unsolicited advice when it comes to personal finances at the end of the season before y'all do something dumb with your money. up to you all if you want to use it or not. to be clear - i'm not telling you to yolo your fire season into 0dte calls on amc, that would be 100p on you. this is simply an attempt to help you grow your wealth and not go into next fire season broke. &#x200b; * if you have a retirement account with your agency and they match your contributions, awesome, you're a good little saver! it's free money so don't leave it on the table. if you do **not** have a retirement account or refuse to let the government invest on your behalf (i don't blame you) here is what i would do: * go to your bank or another financial institution and open a roth ira. you can contribute $6,500 annually unless you make over $153,000 as a single tax filer ($228,000 for y'all married folks/joint filers). roth ira's give you the benefit of using post-tax income and you wont have to pay any subsequent income tax in the future on any gains from your investments. additionally, a roth has zero penalties if used before retirement for education expenses and financing a home will only require around 3% down. pretty neat, innit? * determine your investment style and objectives. i commented on someones post about this earlier this season and included it here. buy low sell high. * [how to think about your investments]( * debts * know the difference between ""good debt"" and ""bad debt."" pay off your bad debt first while making the minimum payments on your good debt to avoid getting murdered by interest rates. * good debt - anything less than 5% * bad debt - anything over 5% edit: good debt would also include something that gains intrinsic/extrinsic value like student loans, mortgages, business loans. bad debt would be thing that depreciate in value such as a vehicle or a credit card. one loses value while the other has an absolutely jacked interest rate. * the 1x1 or 2x rule * do you ever feel guilty about making a frivolous purchase after the season ends? me either, thats why i have a tikka t3x a1 tactical in 6.5 with a viper pst gen ii mrad scope and harris bipod. but on the flip side of that, any time i make a ""large"" purchase out of pure hedonism i also put the same amount (or more) into my retirement/investments. this way i don't feel so bad about being a degenerate. whatever you are willing to spend on yourself, double it. now you'll be wealthier in the years to come and you have a new snowmobile (its a 2012 skidoo but its new to you). * broad based exposure, long term perspective * you are absolutely not going to beat the investment banks or hedge funds. many have tried and few have succeeded. capturing alpha in a world where there is less and less every day is a fools gambit. trust me, i've been doing quantitative analysis on stocks for years and if theres anything i have learned its that markets and banks will stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent. * example - backtest to 1982, if you had invested $10,000 in the s&p that would be worth $1.5m today * etf's, index funds, and mutual funds are your friend here. they are very similar as far as structure where you own a bundle of stocks rather than one on its own. much more tolerant to risk and negative volatility. * dividend snowball * dividends are just payments companies make to investors for owning their assets, not all companies pay them out but there are some powerhouse companies out there that return astounding amounts of capital over time. * for example - you bought 10 shares of company abc for $100/ea. abc pays you a 4% annual dividend on a quarterly basis (4% for the year, 1% every three months). while $40 doesn't seem like a lot, you are essentially buying 40% of one stock in your first year and as it pays out over time that will compound into more shares and higher payout so long as you hold onto your shares. * it may look small now but the power of compound interest and dividend reinvestment will grow overtime. this is almost exactly how berkshire is structured now. warren doesn't really seek out individual winners or hedge risk anymore because the portfolio generates insane amounts of free cash flow. stick with it for the long run and keep stacking it up. thats all i have for you. think of investing as sacrificing some purchasing power today for way more purchasing power down the road. it's the difference between financing an f-250 king ranch right now vs paying cash somewhere down the road. with any luck, some of y'all will put away 10% of your cash to make it more bigger. use that information as you will and i hope you all have a safe rest of your season. be the american the japanese believe you to be. also shouts out to all the contractors who got butthurt when i told the goggins wannabe to go suck his dick. keep it up and one day you’ll be able to pass the fitness test. i hate you and i hope you have a horrible christmas.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/166jeek/nearing_end_of_season_personal_financing/

1618zoh,1692992428,bc wildfire service pull firefighters out of north shuswap after protestors confront rcmp," in case of paywall: british columbia has pulled firefighting crews out of the north shuswap area after a group of protesters confronted rcmp at a highway checkpoint, where the demonstrators argued the mounties do not have the authority to block people from entering a wildfire evacuation zone. forrest tower, a spokesperson for bc wildfire service, on thursday confirmed the wednesday evening retreat and attributed it, in part, to the protesters on the trans-canada highway near sorrento. the crews were reassigned to neighbouring firefighting efforts and have not yet returned. bcws said the protest, in an area where tension between local residents and fire officials is high, put its teams in danger. a video of the shuswap clash, posted on facebook, shows a small group challenging rcmp officers at a checkpoint, with orange pylons and what appears to be a spike belt separating the two sides. jeff rosner, a sicamous resident who recorded the incident, said the crowd members attended the checkpoint to seek answers about the fire. they tried to bring supplies such as food and fuel to friends inside the evacuation zone who remained to defend their property, he added. the protest was reminiscent of those that unfolded during the pandemic, when some people opposed to covid-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates banded together to challenge politicians and those who enforce the law. misinformation, a distrust of authority and the belief that individual rights trump all defined the extended pandemic protests – and the themes resurfaced on the video of the wednesday clash. derek sutherland, the head of protective services at the columbia shuswap regional district, said that while local community members have not always agreed with how fire officials have managed fires in the area, north shuswap residents told him they reject the group that gathered at the police barricade. “they are not supportive of this freedom convoy that was coming to the area,” mr. sutherland said. local residents, he said, were not part of the confrontation. mr. rosner, on the other hand, said everyone in the crowd was from the shuswap area, including evacuees. janis smith, a celista resident, said the agitators should leave the community: “i don’t know who they are and what they are trying to accomplish but they are making it worse, so if they could just go home that would be great.” rcmp, in a statement thursday, said no one was arrested and that the mounties do not expect to press any charges: “it appeared that the intentions of those involved were to overwhelm the police road block and gain access to the area.” police have increased their presence in the area in response to what they described as “ongoing efforts by some individuals who have undermined bc wildfire service fire suppression work through the movement of vital equipment, and have compromised emergency personnel safety through threats of violence.” the area, rcmp said, is not safe because of the threat from wildfires, as well as damage to power lines and unstable trees and buildings. mr. tower, bcws’s information officer, said fire officials considered a number of factors, including the protest, before pulling crews out of the north shuswap area and temporarily reassigning them to other parts of the bush creek east and rossmoore lake wildfires. bcws, on social media wednesday, said it was aware of an “organized effort to dismantle” an rcmp checkpoint. “this is the latest of several decisions that have significantly impacted operational activities in the area. at this time, the environment is unsafe for bcws operations,” the post said, adding it would pull crews out of the north shuswap area. “this decision was not made lightly. the safety of people is our primary concern.” the bcws posts, which appeared shortly before 10 p.m., were quickly deleted. mr. tower said bcws made the posts based on information from rcmp and other partners. as it was posted, rcmp informed bcws that the “situation that we were describing was not as serious in the moment,” mr. tower said. bcws opted to delete, rather than revise, the post “in an effort to not give something steam that didn’t, and doesn’t, deserve to have it,” he said. “we know the power of social media in terms of making something bigger than it might be.” mr. tower said crews were constructing a fireguard near sorrento prior to leaving the area. bcws estimated it had about two days worth of work left to do there once crews return, he said. fire behaviour in the area was not “significant or concerning” thursday and while ground crews have moved out, mr. tower said that helicopters continue to work on the entire bush creek east blaze.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/1618zoh/bc_wildfire_service_pull_firefighters_out_of/

15wxe7s,1692593029,days off and district days to an incident.,"i noticed that some modules on my district were taking days off before leaving on an predetermined assignment to ""reset"". their reasoning is that since they have been working multiple days on district they need to reset before they leave so they don't go over on the maximum days worked for the length of an assignment. i was always under the impression that days worked on district would not affect the length of your assignment and they started once you arrived on scene for your assignment. of course it's nice to take days off before leaving for a couple weeks but i never believed it was actually necessary. i can't find anything that's specifically talks about going from home unit to an assignment though. what is everyone else's take on this? some references: according the the red book for forest service maximum consecutive days worked – home unit... fs – during extended periods of activity in support of local fire management, personnel will have a minimum of 2 days off in any 14-day period. interagency business management handbook (yellow book) management directed days off at home unit supervisors must manage work schedules for initial attack, dispatch, and incident support personnel during extended incident situations. during periods of non-routine or extended activity, these employees will have a minimum of 1 day off in any 21-day period. this minimum requirement should rarely be needed since scheduled days off are normally given much more frequently during periods of routine activity.... indicators of the need for a day off include long shifts, but equally important, the actual observation of the physical and mental condition of the employee.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/15wxe7s/days_off_and_district_days_to_an_incident/

14kfw5x,1687877611,"take care of your mental health ladies and gents, it's no joke. a word of caution from an engine slug.","hey everyone, these last few months have been a bit of a doozy. last year i finished up my fourth season on a fed engine crew, and unfortunately i will not be returning, almost certainly for good. i had some issues with anxiety and depression stemming from a rough childhood throughout junior high and into early high school, but by the time i graduated i was pretty much good. it wasn't perfect, but i was on a med which was working pretty well, and it got to the point where i no longer felt the need to attend therapy as the meds seemed to be enough. i got hired my first eligible season out of high school on a district that was basically entirely a super dry steppe out west. despite this my first two seasons were mostly project work and a few small ias. my third and fourth seasons i was off district for a good forty perfect of the time, and was able to spike out and do some wui stuff in quite a few different states on some pretty large incidents. despite some stressful times on rolls, it wasn't really the work that started getting to me, as it was the neglect of my own mental health with no work life balance. i would go back to the bunkhouse on my off days after rolls and after regular shifts and just sit there. i'd listen to podcasts and it wouldn't even register. no book could keep my attention. i was completely out of it, and if i wasn't working then i wasn't happy. the only thing that invigorated me was the job. if i wasn't working, i was thinking about going back to work. it's the only thing that really gave me any happiness, especially in that last season. the season ended, and i went back east. i started looking for jobs and after a couple months i found a fuels crew job out west, and i was getting ready to head back. to date i have no idea how it flipped on me so quickly, but it was like half a decade of shoving down my emotions came crashing down in about a week. i was absolutely distraught, and i couldn't do a damn thing. suicidal ideation unfortunately has happened on both sides of my family, and i regret to say that i was that low for a significant portion of my time. i finally told my uncle (who raised me, and for all intents and purposes is my father) everything, and being a cna who had worked a bit in the psych ward, he took me to the emergency room. he knew how serious it was, and it was. had he not been there, i probably would have jumped off a bridge. i spent about a month in the psych ward. if you've ever seen one flew over the cuckoo's nest its honestly not that far off. not the chaos, but the hours of heavily medicated people sitting in front of the television in a white room with scrubs. they tried some new medications on me, and i got lucky. some people need years to find the right combo. for me it was only a matter of weeks. i'm out now, and generally stable. i would probably be dead without the med combo i'm currently on. i have made a promise to myself to never return to fire. it's honestly shocking, but i never once felt anxiety on the job. i just got into this mindset where i was able to perfectly compartmentalize any and all feelings, and just focus on work. that being said, someone who has had as serious of anxiety attacks as me probably shouldn't be in emergency services. i never had a severe panic attack on the job, but if i do, i'm going to get somebody killed in a burnover. there is no way in good conscience that i could go back to my crew when the risk is that high. please note, that is not me saying that people with mental health issues should not be in fire. some of the best firefighters i know opened up to me about overcoming addiction, mental health issues, rough relationships, and incarceration. life's challenges often breed the strongest people. this is simply me saying that, knowing my current situation and mental history, i am no longer a suitable candidate for this job. i'm looking for another job now, something less stressful. i got pretty good running a saw so i'm going to apply for one of the state parks or city parks and rec boards. everyone i've talked to says you get to be outside make these spaces nicer for people to spend time in i did some trails work, so i think that i'm going to enjoy my future. it breaks my heart into a million pieces that i can't do fire anymore, but that's just something that i'll have to accept and move forward with. please, if you're experiencing anything like this, depression, anxiety, ptsd, doesn't matter, there is no alternative to healthcare. no amount of zyns, jack daniels and hours in the gym can compensate for the love and support of your family, therapy, and meds if you are determined to need them. going to a doctor doesn't mean you need meds, just remember that. everyone's case is different, and mental healthcare is a hell of a lot more these days than just shoving prozac down your throat. you never know what might work for you. health insurance is obviously a big issue with this position, and also obviously the biggest barrier to getting decent mental healthcare. i'd be willing to argue that most people reading this (if any of you have read this far) don't currently have a health plan as a default perk of your employer. that being said, there are options. it would obviously be a big change, but lots of state agencies give health insurance out to their wildland firefighters. i've met a few people with odf who say one of their primary reasons for staying with the state of oregon is the pretty decent health plan that they get. furthermore, since most of us here are still getting paid peanuts as seasonal employees, lots of us qualify for some okayish prices on health insurance plans. my home state of arkansas has a state run health insurance marketplace that i got my plan through. it's arkansas, so the program isn't great compared to other states, but i was able to pull off a half decent plan from it that isn't completely batshit in price. lots of other states have something similar, and also have people whose sole job is to help clients sign up for them. do some digging, you never know what you might find. tl:dr take care of your mental health, american healthcare sucks, but it can be okayish if you get lucky like me. peace

14eq8ns,1687302064,"some notes from three seasons fighting fire in minnesota, for anyone curious.","spent a few seasons on an engine crew in northern minnesota, thought some people might be curious about how things are done further east. you ever fought fire in alaska? i never was able to unfortunately, but just about everyone i worked with has, and according to them the superior national forest is practically identical. low lying areas full of spruce and tundra-like peat, canoes, skeeters, spike camp, absurdly thick vegetation, seaplanes, hardwood stands that never burn no matter how much drought and wind driven runs you throw at it etc. balsam fir is the devils work. we cut that shit down every chance we got. sapling within ten yards of the rx containment line? cut it down. those things send embers up like a rocket. dig line? almost never. most of the time we just put in a saw line and called it a day. small ias burn so slowly here that it's a lot more efficient to just put a saw line in, cut down ladder fuels from the black, put in a hose lay, and start digging and spraying. i don't think that i ever actually dug line on an ia. what's the point? i could have started digging a hole in may and by the time i was let go in october i still wouldn't have found mineral soil. bwca. one of the most protected tracts of land in the north. guess how protected? no signs. no markers on the lakes. just map and compass out here baby. you know what protected also means? no pumps unless you get special permission in dire circumstances. otherwise, it's bladder bags the whole way through. water? you bet your ass we got water. it makes up almost 20 percent of the forests total acreage. that means that we can set up a pump practically anywhere, and it also means that we've gotta unload gear, portage canoes, and reload gear every lake. a great workout and also horrendously irritating. big fires? sometimes. we tend to get a 10,000+ acre fire every 5-10 years, sometimes a hell of a lot more. they're usually pushed to their full acreage in one or two days of wind. we're smack dab in the center of the country and also right next to lake superior, so the storms here can be quite rough ergo the winds. i saw a bobcat on a few fires, and some feller bunchers, but otherwise next to no heavy equipment. hardly a dozer to be seen on the superior (though i think ely has one). what's the point in most cases? if it doesn't get bogged down, there sure as heck isn't any mineral soil to speak of. the state uses these tracked things called bombardiers in wetland fires, but the fs doesn't have any that i know of. not sure why. ticks. not quite as bad as further east like michigan, but still pretty awful. several people i've met have had lyme at some point. permethrin seems to be the substance of choice to keep away creepy crawlies. saw quite a few moose close to the canadian border and some black bears on a few occasions, but we've also got bobcat, timber wolves, beaver, lynx, mink, fox, wolverine etc. pretty great place to be if you love animals and beautiful forests. rain. lots of rain. overall, if you think you'd like the superior, try it out. the people are super nice (coworkers and townsfolk), most of the districts have pretty decent housing (some really old cabins and others newer apartments), the fires are fun, the environment is great (if a little wet and buggy) and almost all of the supervisors are ex-shots and jumpers who put in their time out west before moving east, so they know their shit. i never worked on the chippewa, but all of their people on severity to the superior were pretty dialed. never worked at voyageurs national park or with any of their crew. the state is pretty much impossible to get a perm position with unless you've got a 4 year. the vast majority of seasonals are only on for a few weeks every spring before green up, and a few weeks before the snowfalls. some of the dnr employees liked the short schedule so they could make some decent money before going back to their primary career, and others were needless to say a little sore at the policy.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/14eq8ns/some_notes_from_three_seasons_fighting_fire_in/

149p4n8,1686792592,should i quit because i am the slowest on my crew?,"today we had a pt hike and i really fell out. all things considered it shouldn’t have been as difficult as it was for me. i am 2 months into the season and have been honestly struggling. i am ashamed to say i’m the slowest on my crew. not by a long shot but still. i am trying as hard as i can, pting twice a day once with the crew and then a run after work, really putting in the effort to be knowledgeable and eager and have a good attitude, but i can’t help but feel like maybe i’m not cut out for this job. i am worried no one on my crew trusts me. it’s not about respect, but i understand that crews need to be able to rely on each other. and i feel like no one thinks they can rely on me because of my fitness and because i’m slow on the hill. i never quit and i never fall so behind they lose me (accept today), but it is obvious i struggle more. the crew is very tight but i haven’t yet felt accepted. people talk about how slow i am. and i’ve heard them say that really my only use on the crew is being an experienced emt. i have been considering leaving, despite loving this more than anything i’ve ever done and wanting a career in fire. i just feel like some people aren’t cut out, and i may be one of them. i’ve heard from people that i will progress etc. but if im not capable now maybe i shouldn’t be dragging my whole crew down. what should i do? is quitting the right option to keep the burden off my crew, especially since i am pretty ostracized from them already. or should i stick it out and embarrass myself until im no longer an embarrassment? i just don’t want to be seen as weak but i feel like either choice will make me look weak. update: all of these comments really boosted my mentality. i was expected a ton of “just quit if you can’t cut it” comments which is exactly how i was feeling. it is nice to realize that a lot of people have gone through this as well. this job is hard and it’s supposed to be hard, but it will get easier. for clarification: i work in r1 for the feds. i was hired on a hand crew but we send out brush trucks as well as crews and i have worked on both modules. fire season hasn’t picked up here yet but i have been on a couple of assignments already so my crew has seen how i work on an incident as well as in training. i talked to a couple of my crew members who have a few years experience on me about how i’m feeling. surprisingly they were very supportive and basically said that they can see improvement already and that i deserve to be on this crew. they said i’m the first woman on this crew in any position in at least 5 years so i think thats a part of why i feel so left out. they did tell me to never say this quitting shit again around anyone else or the crew really will see me as weak, so i probably won’t be confiding in my team again.. but it was nice to hear that they don’t hate me as much as i feel they do. i’m coming from a fuels background for the most part so i got strong with the saw and gained that endurance…but that work never had this much hiking with weight. i understand everyone has to start somewhere and im trying to keep my attitude up and my self hatred to a minimum. i also realize that as embarrassing it is to be slow on the hill, being the girl who quit before the season even really began would be so much worse. i’ll stick it out and probably look for a crew with better vibes next season if this continues.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/149p4n8/should_i_quit_because_i_am_the_slowest_on_my_crew/

16cn9sg,1694113634,nffe targets leadership in congress to pass wildland firefighter pay cliff bill,"&#x200b; as the deadline to avoid a severe pay cliff for federal wildland firefighters approaches, the national federation of federal employees (nffe) is focusing on house and senate [leadership]( to pass critical legislation by the end of the month. if funding is not approved by congress by september 30th, federal wildland firefighters will see their base pay cut by 50 percent, up to $20,000. union officials and wildland firefighters are meeting with members of congress next week to lobby support for the wildland firefighter paycheck protection act (wfppa) and the tim hart wildland firefighter classification and pay parity act (tim’s act). both pieces of legislation would permanently increase pay for federal wildland firefighters and help avert a wave of mass resignations within an already understaffed workforce. facing a potential government shutdown, congress is saddled with several other significant political [issues]( that have taken priority over increasing spending to protect wildland firefighter wages, such as aid for the war in ukraine and natural disaster relief funding. with those spending concerns, as well as legislation to avoid the pay cliff for wildland firefighters, it is critical that house republicans join their colleagues to approve additional funding. “we are incredibly close to an absolute disaster for not only our wildland firefighters, but the country as a whole,” said nffe national president randy erwin. “if congress allows this pay cliff to happen, the federal government will not have a workforce to protect our lands from the wildfire crisis. communities will burn and people will die. nffe and wildland firefighters across the country have worked tirelessly over the past year to have legislation introduced to avoid this catastrophe. congressional leaders, especially house republicans, must listen to their constituents and understand that their inaction on this issue will be devastating. congress must pass a bill to avoid the pay cliff before it is too late.”",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/16cn9sg/nffe_targets_leadership_in_congress_to_pass/

[ [ [ it's commonplace for the news media to cast blame for these problems on poor working conditions, scandals and under-funding, but are those explanations adequate? recruitment campaigns all seem to take the approach of appealing to the selfish gene: join us: here is what we offer you! no-one these days is appealing to the notion of service above self. no-one is asking the younger generation to step up, shoulder some of the burden, or do their duty. we just never hear that kind of thing anymore. what gives, canada? what needs to change? 0 comments ",canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/15wemvq/how_to_increase_enlistment_in_volunteer_fire/

zuqyj9,1671944158,happy holidays and joyeux noël!,"on behalf of the moderation team of r/canada we would like to take the opportunity to wish you all a happy holidays, a merry christmas and a happy new year. &#x200b; feel free to take the time to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming new year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over hanukkah and christmas day. many of us will find ourselves shovelling snow, tending to homemade rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it is a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities! &#x200b; challenges of covid-19, flu, and other respiratory virus remain prevalent this year and severe snow conditions are creating dangerous travel conditions. with these in mind, please be safe, look after yourselves and others, and listen to local guidance towards how you can continue to be safe and healthy this holiday season. &#x200b; while many of us turn our attention towards our families, the holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. many users here may feel isolated, or may be in crisis, but you are not alone. there are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. if you or someone you love is in crisis, we encourage you to reach out, talk, and get help. we know it is not easy to take that first step to realize you need help. &#x200b; for those of you who have served, we encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. if you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, the cf member assistance program crisis and referral centre can be contacted 24/7 at 1-800-268-7708 (tty: 1-800-567-5803 for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing). recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. you are not alone. &#x200b; we hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. no matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. please do not drink and drive. &#x200b; our thoughts are also with the thousands of first responders working through the holidays and those deployed overseas serving in the canadian armed forces. those on the front lines are keeping us going through this pandemic, keeping us fed, healthy and moving forward. &#x200b; look after each other, and always remember there is a person at the other side of the screen. we encourage everyone takes the opportunity to be kinder to each other and remember that with renewed focus on mental health, being kind to those you may disagree with can make everyone's experience more positive. we encourage you to share pictures, stories and experiences you have had this year (or previous years) to help spread a positive holiday spirit. &#x200b; we hope you all had a joyous and happy hanukkah, and enjoy a merry christmas, a great holiday, and a very happy new year! ***************** au nom de l'équipe de modération de r/canada, nous profitons de l'occasion pour vous souhaiter à tous de bonnes fêtes de fin d'année, un joyeux noël et une bonne année. &#x200b; n'hésitez pas à prendre le temps de partager avec la communauté vos vœux pour la nouvelle année à venir, vos propres traditions de vacances ou vos expériences pendant hanoukka et le jour de noël. beaucoup d'entre nous seront amenés à pelleter de la neige, à s'occuper de patinoires artisanales ou à déguster des friandises spéciales pendant les fêtes et c'est le moment idéal pour partager nos activités de vacances uniques (et souvent très similaires) ! &#x200b; les défis posés par le covid-19, la grippe et d'autres virus respiratoires restent prévalents cette année et les conditions de neige sévères créent des conditions de voyage dangereuses. dans ce contexte, soyez prudents, prenez soin de vous et des autres, et écoutez les conseils locaux sur la façon dont vous pouvez continuer à être en sécurité et en bonne santé pendant les fêtes. &#x200b; alors que beaucoup d'entre nous tournent leur attention vers leur famille, la saison des fêtes peut également être une période difficile et stressante pour de nombreux canadiens, alors un mot gentil ou le simple fait de tendre la main à un vieil ami pour lui dire bonjour peut signifier beaucoup à cette période de l'année. de nombreux utilisateurs peuvent se sentir isolés ou en situation de crise, mais vous n'êtes pas seuls. il existe des ressources pour vous aider, ou même pour avoir quelqu'un à qui parler. si vous, ou l'un de vos proches, êtes en crise, nous vous encourageons à tendre la main, à parler et à obtenir de l'aide. nous savons qu'il n'est pas facile de faire le premier pas pour réaliser que vous avez besoin d'aide. &#x200b; pour ceux d'entre vous qui ont servi, nous vous encourageons à tendre la main à vos frères et sœurs, le simple fait d'entendre une voix amicale peut faire la différence entre la vie et la mort. si vous êtes un ancien combattant ou un membre actif en crise, il existe de l'aide, le centre d'orientation et de crise du programme d'aide aux membres des fc peut être contacté 24/7 au 1-800-268-7708 (ats : 1-800-567-5803 pour les personnes sourdes ou malentendantes). reconnaître que vous avez besoin d'aide est aussi important que d'obtenir le soutien et l'aide dont vous avez besoin. vous n'êtes pas seul. &#x200b; nous espérons que vous passerez tous des fêtes de fin d'année en toute sécurité. quelle que soit la façon dont vous les célébrez, soyez prudents et n'oubliez pas de ne pas boire (ou fumer) et de ne pas conduire. chaque année, nous voyons des articles tragiques sur des familles déchirées à la suite d'accidents évitables. s'il vous plaît, ne buvez pas et ne conduisez pas. &#x200b; nos pensées vont également aux milliers de premiers intervenants qui travaillent pendant les fêtes et à ceux qui sont déployés à l'étranger dans les forces armées canadiennes. ceux qui sont en première ligne nous permettent de traverser cette pandémie, de nous nourrir, de rester en bonne santé et d'aller de l'avant. &#x200b; prenez soin les uns des autres et n'oubliez jamais qu'il y a une personne de l'autre côté de l'écran. nous encourageons tout le monde à saisir l'occasion d'être plus gentil les uns envers les autres et à se rappeler qu'avec le regain d'intérêt pour la santé mentale, être gentil avec ceux avec qui vous pouvez être en désaccord peut rendre l'expérience de chacun plus positive. nous vous encourageons à partager des photos, des histoires et des expériences que vous avez vécues cette année (ou les années précédentes) pour aider à répandre un esprit de vacances positif.",canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/zuqyj9/happy_holidays_and_joyeux_noël/

14xqpdr,1689173424,"more housing: 650 non-market apartments in false creek north. ""i'm concerned it'll block my view of false creek""","\[update: passed unanimously! video of the public hearing: [ a huge thank-you to everyone who wrote in. that was an amazing response - more than 800 people sent in comments in support. [the agenda]( has a link to everyone's comments.\] tldr: we have a terrible shortage of housing, especially affordable housing. the province has agreed to build three non-market rental buildings in false creek north, including two high-rises, with a total of 650 apartments. the city still needs to say yes. there's a public hearing thursday afternoon, and there’s significant opposition (27 comments opposed, 3 in support). if you'd like to counterbalance the opposition (or if you're also opposed!), it takes literally 60 seconds to [submit a comment]( it can be as simple as ""i support this plan."" just set the subject to ""false creek north non-market housing."" &#x200b; [non-market housing is planned for sites 3, 4, and 5]( when false creek north (the former expo lands) was being planned for redevelopment, the goal was always to have it be mixed-income, with 20% non-market homes. over the last two or three decades there's been 540 non-market homes built (i think a bit less than half of the target), but there were long delays in getting anything else built. the city of vancouver announced in february that it had reached an agreement with concord pacific to acquire three sites in false creek north for non-market housing, between granville bridge and cambie bridge. bc housing will build a 28-storey building, a 29-storey building, and a seven-storey building, all with non-market housing. the proposal also includes a new fire hall and a daycare. there'll be a total of about 650 homes. you sometimes hear housing skeptics say, ""we don't need more housing, we need more *affordable* housing."" they're wrong (we need both!), but it's certainly true that there’s a huge shortage of housing that’s affordable to people with regular jobs. there's limits to how much non-market housing you can build, because unlike market housing, it requires public subsidy (typically contributions of land or capital). but when there's an opportunity to get 650 non-market homes built, with construction fully funded by the province, it seems like a good idea to take it. the target is that 30% will be ""low end of market"" (helping to cross-subsidize the lower-income apartments, but run on a non-profit basis), 50% will be lower-income (household income below a certain threshold), and 20% will be ""deeply affordable"" (shelter/pension rate). the lower-income thresholds are: annual household income of up to $58,000 for a 1br or studio, $72,000 for 2br, $86,000 for 3br. 25% of the apartments will be 2br or 3br, so suitable for families. because these are non-market rather than market, i expect there’ll be an application process to apply for them. (for an example of what this might look like, see the application process for [catalyst community development’s rental buildings]( but for renters (more than half of vancouverites), this helps even if you’re not living there yourself: when there’s 650 renter households who are living in non-market rentals, that’s 650 fewer households competing for market rentals. when we’re trying to drive up the vacancy rate, everything helps. thing is, **non-market housing runs into exactly the same obstacles as market housing**. the city’s zoning is quite restrictive, and actually allowing bc housing to build these projects requires the city to change its laws. so there’s been several months of public consultation, and now a rezoning hearing thursday afternoon. it looks like there’ll be a fair amount of opposition. confusingly, the city’s term for non-market housing aimed at lower-income households is “social housing,” but it also has an entirely separate category for “supportive housing,” i.e. housing for people who are homeless or destitute. this is non-market, mixed-income housing, not supportive housing. reading through the comments from opponents, a lot of people talk about “increased criminal burden.” i think they’re imagining that this will be supportive housing. comments from opponents: * i'm concerned my view of false creek will be blocked, and feel that the space could be better used as a park. * the initial plan to build 8 storey buildings was what drove us to buy at 930 cambie street. this updated plan is jeopardizing the value of our condo and obliterating the views of false creek we currently enjoy. this change of plan is unacceptable. * an excessively large development could lead to overcrowding, increased traffic congestion, limited parking spaces, and decreased privacy for residents. such negative impacts would compromise the character and charm of our community, potentially diminishing property values and causing distress to current homeowners. * this project will obviously damage yaletown and increase the criminal burden of our communities! * social housing needs to be balanced with market housing to integrate all members of society, to ensure integration, diversity and safety. having 2 large high rises concentrated in one small area risks creating an area that is no longer safe for tourists on the false creek walkway, children and families in cooper's park. more: * [agenda]( for the public hearing * [previous post]( * frances bula on the [obstacles faced by non-market housing]( may 2021 * [hamilton non-profits face 'infuriating' delays to build affordable housing, as city looks to change]( april 2023. similar stories from hamilton. part of [a series](",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/14xqpdr/more_housing_650_nonmarket_apartments_in_false/

13ig7e7,1684175555,a plea/reminder to everyone here and in the rest of the province: be fire safe this summer!,"now that summer has unofficially started, we're in for hot days and dry grass and forests. i think i speak for literally everyone when i say we do not want yet another year of out of control wildfires. it's inevitable that we'll get some that won't be human caused, but it's everyone's duty to be responsible for themselves. that being said, here are some things you can do to minimize the risk of starting a fire: * don't toss cigarette butts out the car window or carelessly onto the ground. if you see your friend do this, please call them out on it. be that stick in the mud. remind everyone you hang out with that it's irresponsible. * obey local/provincial fire bans. look, i know some people really really like bonfires out by the lake or whatever.. but all it takes is one ember to fly off in the wind and land on a patch of dry grass for disaster to strike. your desire to have a bonfire at the lake does not override nearby residents' right to not have their homes burn down. * get familiar with how to use fire extinguishers and carry some with you if you go out rving/camping. look up youtube videos if you need to, ask/show your friends how to do it. it's never a bad idea to familiarize yourself with this invaluable tool. * report any dangerous fire activities to authorities. see some drunk college kids being reckless with a bonfire? call it in. see a fire started by a lightning strike? call it in. the sooner it's known about, the sooner firefighters can act. * know when to use water to put out a fire and when not to. anyone who's been a cook knows you should never use water to put out a grease fire. cutting off oxygen is the key, as that is the fuel for most fires. throw dirt on it, use an extinguisher, or cover the fire with a lid if it's small enough. i want to enjoy this summer as much as the rest of you do. please feel free to add more fire safety tips and remember to tell your friends to be responsible. as a certain bear once said: only you can prevent forest fires!",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/13ig7e7/a_pleareminder_to_everyone_here_and_in_the_rest/

1335uu6,1682800165,critical mass ride report (april),"been pretty annoyed about the whole broadway bike lane situation + the stanley park thing as well so decided to get out and ride a bike along with about a hundred other people. numbers were actually pretty good - along with this, it was a nice mild sunny day so i had my first day this year riding in a t-shirt and shorts, and i saw many others doing the same. a perfect day for cm really. we started off at the art gallery, as usual, and then headed along hornby towards the granville bridge, where we stopped for a minute to let everyone catch up and do a chicago bike hold-up. then we proceeded onto broadway for a few km, going back on the cambie bridge, and then after some riding along w georgia the mass decided to go over the burrard bridge onto cornwall ave, where a 5 year old was seriously injured by a speeding car this past summer. after this, we headed back onto broadway and ended the ride at olympic village, so we did around 30km more or less. i really liked how the mass decided to focus their attention on routes that had sub-par or non-existent bike infrastructure; biking on broadway and seeing all the bikes and shops around me without having to worry about being hit by a car was a pretty euphoric feeling. along with cornwall ave, where community members have been advocating for lower speed limits as it passes through pedestrian heavy vibrant neighbourhoods - and of course, again, a 5 year old kid was almost killed by a speeding car while she was standing on the sidewalk. overall morale was pretty good, i'd say. most drivers were very supportive and we got a nice stream of friendly honks going for quite a while. there wasn't really any antagonizing of drivers or starting fights for no reason - everyone was just there to have their voices heard, and to have fun. and yes, we did let road cyclists pass, for the naysayers. of course, when you have a big enough mass, you've gotta start corking - and i was one of the corkers for about half of the red lights we passed through. 99% of the time, drivers simply waited patiently for the mass to pass through the intersection, which we were very thankful for. there was only one time where a taxi driver started laying on his horn and yelling, and we simply responded with clapping and positivity. remember, corking allows the entire mass to clear the intersection faster than if we had split up into multiple groups, and it keeps people safer as cars aren't trying to force their way through the group. if you ever get caught in a cm, please be patient - i'm sure you're able to wait a minute. there was one time where a fire truck was zoomin down the road and it was almost like moses parting the sea, the way a hundred people all moved over to the right at the same time in order to clear a lane to let them through. ironically, because of us, the fire truck most likely made it to its destination quicker than if the street had been filled up with cars all trying to get out of the way. there were also two times on broadway where some idiots in luxury suvs decided to cross the yellow line into *oncoming traffic* in order to pass the mass and there was one instance where they got trapped by an oncoming car and had to sort of force-merge their way back into our lanes. it's very telling where motorists' priorities are when they'll happily wait in rush hour traffic twice a day five days a week, but as soon as they get delayed for 5 minutes by anyone who isn't in a car, they'll start performing dangerous maneuvers and using their vehicle as a weapon to force their way past other people. we're just as entitled to the road as much as they are. when people go ""but you don't need bike lanes on broadway!!11!11"", this is literally a prime example of why we do. cars and bikes just don't mix well. it was a great feeling to take back our streets for a few hours. i'm totally headed to next month's ride and i hope to see some of you there as well.",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1335uu6/critical_mass_ride_report_april/
131zb8f,1682698705,it's spring! help our local nesting birds thrive,"hey vanteam. our birds are delightful, hilarious and add a lot to our local communities. they're also nesting right now! if you want to help them out this year, here's a list of things to be aware of that'll make their lives easier. &#x200b; * cats. cats decimate bird populations. truly, birds have little chance against even the laziest indoor/outdoor feline (lookin' at you, earl). bells do not work very well. google ""coloured cat collars"" and consider putting one on your cat. yes, they'll look like an (even more) deranged member of the insane clown posse, but they'll murder less. and less murder is good. or keep them inside. just for spring. they'll live. the birds probably will not. * keep dogs on-leash in on-leash areas. many forest trails, particularly in the north shore, are on-leash. birds nest both low and high, and when your dog goes traipsing through bushes they may be unintentionally stomping on bird nests. their energy freaks birds out, too, so even if your bud didn't step on anything, it might have scared mom so bad that she won't return to her eggs. * do not -- ever-- put mouse traps out in the open. you ever see a bird, probably a crow, with a smashed top-beak? mouse trap. let's apply some empathy. ""oh, hey, cool, cheese"" -- slam. ""ow! why?"" beak broken forever. it doesn't grow back. your crow friends laugh at you. you have to sleep on the lower branches and you get pooped on at night. if you must trap your mice, please use a box -- that's what they're for! open traps are brutal bird killers. * put reflective stickers on your windows. birds smash into them all the time and it's very sad. if they aren't killed outright, often time they're concussed and easy prey (see #1). my partner and i saw a mother flicker teaching her babies about glass by having them try to fly into it for an afternoon. it blew us away and broke our hearts; they're so much smarter than we think. * clean your feeders and fountains. if you have them, please keep them clean. while we were slammed with covid, our local birds were slammed with avian pox. it was gruesome... we suffer together, truly; clean food and water for them means healthier fledglings. * pause any major yard work such as bush/tree removals until the second half of june. the sun makes us eager to get out there, but jumping in too early with the saw is a sure-fire way of freaking birds out. naturally, planting local flowers and bushes helps our ecosystems, which benefits the birds. have more ideas? share them! together we can make vancouver a safe and beautiful place for all creatures, human and bird alike.",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/131zb8f/its_spring_help_our_local_nesting_birds_thrive/

(we have multiple offices and branches so we are profitable) we also have cash incentives to get you to become a monthly donations (thousands of dollars spread out with each top seller) we have 10 days to get 5 donors or we get fired. so i will be telling you about the charity i’m working and to donate thru the websites until i get fired :) if you have a job opening thats not as scummy as this that i can interview for let me know. please do not be rude to canvassers upper management are the leechs they are selling you a charity( a good cause) and making money from it they make 30+ a hour most canvassers are immigrants or students who believe in what they are doing raising money for charity’s if we don’t meet our quota we get fired this is a job like everything else some are amazing people. tips to send canvassers away. put a no soliciting sign up we will usually not knock tell us you are already contributing we will usually thank you a simply no i’m not interested saves a lot of time. if we stop donating to canvassers and donate directly to charities more of our money will be going to a good cause then to someone who is selling u the idea of helping when they are taking most of your money. we aren’t actually doing your tax forms or anything like that we are just signing you up thru our end so we have proof we signed you up to donate. charity’s that we work with they are good cause and you should donate if you are able to afford it.(please donate through the website and not thru canvassers) < doctors without borders > < unicef (united nations emergency fund) > < wwf ( world wide life foundation) > < red cross > < plan international > < bc children’s hospital > < bc cancer agency> i like the bc children’s hospital, donations help fund medical programs as well as programs so children can be children and have fun and really experience childhood. just because they are in the hospital doesn’t mean that they can’t experience what being a kid feels like. it also helps the hospitals be able to get emotional support dogs and cats and i think thats really cool :)",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/11ybye5/psa_door_to_door_charitys/

[#]( why the enthusiasm for lvt in the early 1900s? there were many reasons but the main one was that cities were competing for new residents: > land value taxation spread like wildfire throughout western canada as a consensus emerged that it spurred development. in this rapidly developing region, where municipalities were competing for population and investment, the pressure to adopt a more efficient basis of taxation was irresistible. [#]( lvt didn't last long as the only tax. enthusiasm for lvt waned after the world entered a recession and vancouver's first property bubble burst. in 1918 vancouver switched to a hybrid of lvt and something similar to today's property tax. over the next several decades, homeowners became an increasingly powerful voting bloc. tax policy was incrementally changed to be more favourable for them. the changes would: > ""reduce the relative tax load on vacant land and single-family dwelling groups but would increase the tax load on apartments, industrial and commercial groups” (vcc minutes 1969). [#]( in 1984 lvt was fully eliminated. *shout out to /u/vqql whose [comment]( inspired this post.*",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/142mi8a/vancouver_used_to_have_a_property_tax_that/

15v8sue,1692428043,cycling review (long): central valley to bc parkway loop,"(long read, my apologies!) edit: just realized i posted the title going backwards whoops! given the heavy smoke expected in the next few days and having nothing to do on a friday night, i decided to loop the central valley greenway (cvg) and bc parkway (bcp) tonight from commercial and broadway to new westminster. earlier this week someone was discussing the awkward rupert station transition (it's gotten worse!) but there's other screwy spots that make this an intermediate/advanced ride, which is a shame because this could otherwise be a really fun day trip/outing. the following is a pretty comprehensive review bcp eastbound vancouver - 8/10 overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride in vancouver proper. heading through trout lake on the dedicated bike path is pretty easy and people generally stick to the gravel pedestrian path. there's a short but steep climb between 19th and stainsbury to reconnect with the skytrain line at nanaimo. the bike path at nanaimo has been really improved recently, with clear separated lanes to a dedicated incline at nanaimo station up to slocan st. there's an awkward transition at slocan to 29th ave that requires a bit of road use, but then the dedicated path behind 29th is pretty well developed and spills on to vaness, which is not a busy road when it needs to be taken. passing joyce station i find it much simpler to take venables st to boundary than the separated bike path because of heavy pedestrian use, and relatively light vehicle traffic with intersections only on the south side. bcp burnaby - 6/10 similar heavy pedestrian use on the path in central park path with no real work around. the metrotown area again has heavy shared pedestrian use on the bike path, and i found it was better to ride beresford alongside very light traffic. crossing the road at willingdon requires a lot of caution. the transition at central blvd and imperial has been improved from a very thin awkward sidewalk riding against traffic, it's been widened with a vehicle fence which feels so much safer. once you get back on the parkway the ride gets pretty choppy with many busy and undeveloped vehicles crossings that require a lot of caution until you return to beresford. i also found the road to be better than the bike path, although i've taken both without issue. the traffic is very light and there's no absent minded pedestrians. crossing to prenter st the path gets very narrow, with construction entirely blocking a transition on to the bike path. edmonds station gets very nice again with a short dip through a park and a dedicated path behind the skytrain maintenance yard.. the path is winding with a steep decline, so it's definitely best to have the brakes ready! overall this stretch is a real joy until 22nd station in new westminster. bcp new westminster - 4/10 what. the. fuck. as soon as you get across 22nd station you're riding a thin sidewalk along stewardson, which is the bcp in both directions and the only pedestrian sidewalk. thankfully i was the only using it at the time. lots of intersections to be cautious of right turning drivers along. this is not a safe path to ride, use a lot of caution. once you get to quayside things open up a bit again with shared road and light vehicle traffic. there's one section of diagonal train tracks to watch out for along this stretch lest you catch a wheel! crossing the train tracks to columbia st leads to a nice separated bike path downtown, the transition to the cvg at the patullo. cvg new west (westbound) - 4/10 things are really nice until you pass the patullo. then you're stuck on a thin stretch of sidewalk with only plastic pylon barriers, riding against traffic until mcbride st. this section is very unsafe to navigate without a lot of caution, nerve wracking, it's a busy road and there's nothing but a few plastic bumpers between you and the oncoming traffic. things get nice and riding through the park at victoria hill, only to end up back against traffic, crossing driveways and intersections on the sidewalk at e columbia.... not ideal but not scary like the previous, and next part. as soon as you cross cumberland st there's about two blocks of incredibly narrow shared use sidewalk, with pedestrians and two way bike traffic for about 200m. like this would be nerve wracking to walk along if it was busy, much less ride. i would even have trouble dismounting safely here, so thankfully there was no pedestrians. then there's a massive hill to climb on e columbia heading to royal columbian, followed by a downhill to catch your breath at kelly st. following kelly to hume park the cvg gets a dedicated lane again, which is a nice descent that wraps around the park to the bottom of e columbia/north road. a clear crossing, a slight separated path, then you're back on the sidewalk against traffic on north road. with no signage to tell you to follow a dim path east off north road on a gravel path, i lost the connection and ended up taking lougheed highway to vancouver. cvg burnaby - 8/10 again i missed the connection and ended up going against traffic on north road until getting to a bunch of parking lots, where i took a break and walked it through. however i've ridden the burnaby portion of the cvg before and can say that this is a much nicer bike path with dedicated trails through burnaby lake and shared lane with light traffic along winston and still creek. the only issues that really presents itself with crossings is an awkward intersection at douglas rd and still creek. there's no simple way to navigate this intersection so use caution. i'm also not a huge fan of separated lanes running along sidewalks that cross parking lots, so tend to just use still creek when traffic is light. the little path connecting gilmore is really cool, but it tends to flood in the spring/fall. a little path behind the home depot to boundary, and a large crossing with a pedestrian light connect to vancouver. honestly pretty good! cvg vancouver - 8/10 honestly this path is generally well thought out and straightforward with very few inclines. it's one of the ideal bike paths i've seen in this city with minimal light shared road use except for rupert station. you may as well just walk it right now anyways, since the east side of the street next to the station is barricaded to dismount anyways. a steady incline to nanaimo st (felt brutal by this point haha) and then a mix of dedicated and traffic controlled lanes to e 10th ave. technically the path crosses broadway here and continues left on 8th, but for transit connection go left. there's an awkward hard left turn and a mixed use pedestrian crossing, but the short stretch of 10th between victoria and commercial has again been greatly improved.",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/15v8sue/cycling_review_long_central_valley_to_bc_parkway/

xrkv07,1664490317,my best friend relapsed and is likely going to die in a matter of weeks if he isn't involuntarily admitted somewhere. what should i do?,"he had been stable on prescribed morphine after getting off fentanyl for almost a year until his relationship fell apart last week. he then called me yesterday morning saying he was kicked out of his moms and in bad shape (he is an adult, lives in fraser health region) so i picked him up and brought him to my place to talk. ^^^^^ i then realized the extent of the situation as he pulled a roll of tinfoil out of his bag and started smoking what i assume is some sort of super-heroin (worse than fentanyl because somehow he still passed a urine test for his father this morning after i had him picked up from my house). ^^^^^ the way he was acting on it makes me think it was one of the new variants that contains benzodiazepine analogs that are not yet identified here so tests won't show them, but i have never seen anyone more incapacitated in my life and i was unable to have a real conversation with him the entire time he was here. he fell down multiple times, had scrapes and bruises already when i picked him up, and was in and out of states of what seemed to be psychosis saying things that made no sense and even walking back in to the house thinking he was at his dad's house at one point. ^^^^^ i was just in awe because this is someone i've watched battling addiction for many years, he's overdosed multiple times, but finally was stable and building his life again until this week i guess. i sat there with narcan the whole time as he came in and out of consciousness with no sense of reality. i texted his dad and told him what was going on and he came and picked him up to take him straight to royal columbia in the hopes they would do a 72hr psych hold or whatever the standard protocol is, but somehow, they let him refuse treatment and walk away despite the fact that he looked like he was about to die. his dad told me he just asked ""am i being detained?"" repeatedly and they let him walk away. ^^^^^ he is currently sleeping at his dads house and i know as soon as he wakes up he will head out to find more of that shit. he said multiple things about self-harm last night, but problem is that he often would sarcastically say that for as long as i've known him so it would be disingenuous for me to say that he meant it this time, so idk what to do. ^^^^^ i am the only one he trusts, he's having paranoid delusions with everyone else, so if he knows that i called in and got him picked up i would potentially lose all contact with him and maybe never see him again. at the same time, he's so gone right now that i have no hope of any sort of personal intervention, heavy duty medical intervention is likely the only way he lives in this scenario. i don't know what to do, his parents don't know what to do (they are divorced and don't speak but i've been in touch with both of them exchanging info and filling them in on the reality of the situation). ^^^^^ is there any good option here?",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/xrkv07/my_best_friend_relapsed_and_is_likely_going_to/

xjrjgu,1663725450,saved a life today: reality vs theory/news,"i (f28) am an hcp (health care professional) and during my workday was called to bring a naloxone kit to the front of the building because they suspect someone was overdosing. my coworker d (f) came with me as support. when we arrived on scene there were a couple men surrounding a man who was collapsed on the sidewalk, blue in the face, not breathing. i’ve never seen someone like that before. one person was giving (poor) cpr. nobody called 9-1-1 yet so d got on the phone right away while i get started on the naloxone. i point at an onlooker staff and yell to get an aed. (i should mention as per my job requirements, i have to have emergency first aid and cpr-c, and thankfully i just renewed at the end of august) everyone around me looked clueless. they had no idea what an aed was. when the first dose gets into this guy’s system, he gasps for air, and i can actually see his face become more pink. but the effects are short-lived and i continue giving naloxone until i’ve run out of doses. i continue to yell for an aed (surprisingly at my job there isn’t one) until someone understands). somewhere in between my manager s (f) comes out and she takes over cpr. this guy would breathe for a little, and then slip back into unconsciousness. i finally got an aed at the same time the paramedics arrived. they took over and so we left the scene to give them space to work. later we find out he declined the ride to hospital, is up and talking and having a smoke. the paramedics said if we had not been there, he would not have lived. he said thank you to d when she saw him later. i’m generally very calm and logical during emergencies as i’ve been through a lot now (even though it shouldn’t be common my my profession). but i’ve never actually had to use naloxone, or use/see actual cpr, or see someone dead/dying/brink of death, or need to control the scene. i’ve learned that again theory is very different than reality. 1. naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose but definitely does not last as long as we were taught 2. cpr looks way different on an actual person 3. not everyone knows what an aed is 4. someone who looks like they’re dying is more obvious than i thought (vs sleeping) anyway, i just wanted to share what i learned today, and maybe discuss any tips or advice for future emergencies or any “firsts” that wasn’t what you expected. tl;dr me and my coworkers brought a man back to life from the brink of death from opioid overdose and this was my first big emergency scenario and it was way different than what i learned eta: thank you for the awards! thank you for letting me know about potential ptsd. i will be more aware and mindful of my mental state and speak to a professional if needed. i really appreciate all the kind words and advice/tips as well! eta2: aed stands for [automated external defibrillator](",vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/xjrjgu/saved_a_life_today_reality_vs_theorynews/

169eai1,1693790682,growing disillusioned with my job- oh yeah hey i'm a cso btw.,"in discussions about the trades, it becomes apparent that we need more skilled workers in these fields. however, as someone deeply involved in safety on the job, it's disheartening to witness the ongoing compromises. safety often takes a back seat, and it's only when an unfortunate incident occurs that people start paying attention. this negligence is driven by concerns about expenses, inconvenience, annoyance, and time constraints. even organizations like worksafe sometimes seem focused on saving money or time, leading to ambiguous laws. our occupational health and safety standards in british columbia are notably higher than those in other provinces, yet there's a push to lower them to a ""universal"" standard across the country for the sake of time and cost savings. the title ""construction safety officer"" is primarily associated with vancouver building codes, but what most of us do is act as ""qualified coordinators."" it's crucial for all of us to have at least a minimum ofa 2 certification to cover these sites. sometimes, the responsibilities can be overwhelming for a single cso due to the vagueness and subjectivity of the regulations. it's frustrating that every site i oversee seems to have its peculiar issues. phrases like ""look the other way,"" ""scrub the records,"" and ""worksafe hasn't visited this site in over 2 years; let's keep it that way"" are all too common. but when a colleague decides to adhere strictly to the rules, worksafe suddenly decides to inspect all those sites within the company. they might find a couple of machines out of compliance, label it a day for inspections, throw that colleague under the bus, fire them, and bring in someone like me who won't report the company. just the other day, a mexican worker suffered a severe injury—a snapped-back hammer to the face—resulting in a rtc scenario. shockingly, there was another worker injured at the same time, but it was treated as a triage scenario- had to let that one go and deal with the mexican- who turned out to be an undocumented worker- had to fly back to mexico that night for facial surgery. scrub the records of him even existing on the site. in such situations, you learn that sometimes safety takes a back seat and many laws are being broken every day. and when it comes to industrial jobs, it's sometimes a joke. working in confined spaces without proper safety measures can make you feel like your life is at the mercy of the task at hand. for instance, consider the risks involved in projects like the broadway subway construction. in case of an earthquake, it's a precarious situation. entering the trades is a commendable choice, but it's essential to be aware of the risks you're assuming on every site, every day. if you're indispensable to the project, safety violations may go unnoticed because the site super needs you to keep the operation running smoothly. we, safety professionals, are essentially insurance policies hired to minimize risks, but oftentimes safety takes a backseat. if nobody else seems to care, it's essential to remember that you bear the responsibility when you work these jobs. also, it's worth noting that in some situations, it may be cheaper for everyone to deal with your ""loss of life on the job"" over a carrier ending injury. consider this a warning: our country is facing similar issues to america in terms of workplace safety. we used to set the bar high with the best safety gear and the highest standards, but that seems to be a thing of the past. lastly, a word of caution: avoid riding the broadway subway once it's operational. you've been warned.",britishcolumbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/169eai1/growing_disillusioned_with_my_job_oh_yeah_hey_im/

15yxaap,1692778157,the second best time to be a volunteer first responder is now.,"edit: this post has gained alot of traction and i want to reiterate that the only reason there isnt more destruction is because of the cooperation between fire fighters and the community. i was quite emotional when writing this and part of me wants to delete it but for now i will leave it up. thank you for all the supportive comments its appreciated. i am on the front lines in scotch creek and celista. i'm working with the fire departments and citizens to keep them fed and safe. the first day we had hundreds of people coming and going asking what they can do to help. every single one was defying the evacuation order to save their town. a noble and honourable act indeed. the fire chief meticulously took each ones names and numbers and relevant skills. they were told the best place to go to put out spot fires. they brought food and supplies to the firehall and were in turn fed and watered. they were an integral part of saving the town. i watched this unfold with my own eyes. so many people acting courageously when the time came. hundreds of people willing to risk their lives to protect their town, yet the volunteer fire departments total manpower is less than 20. it makes my blood absolutely boil. if even half of those 100 people had stepped up and received training they could have been infinitely more useful in slowing the fires. the #1 problem they had was manpower. they had hundreds of people available willing to fight but all that manpower is useless without the communication and organization that is needed to actually properly fight the fires. i have the utmost respect for each one of those citizens and i beg beg beg anyone who feels that they have the strength and courage to defy an evacuation order to protect their town to join the fucking agencies that are dedicated to do that exact thing. if they had 100 volunteer firefighters with 100 radios they could justify the expense of 100 sets of gear, more trucks, more equipment. instead we had locals fighting fires in the middle of the bush when houses were burning. we had air assets available to deploy but they couldnt because locals were in the middle of the forest fighting fires. i'm not even going into the thefts because desperate people saving their homes do desperate things. its despicable, but i can at least emphasize with it. what absolutely enraged me was finding a group of locals 10km from town fighting a fire using obviously stolen equipment in an area where no structures were at risk. they were there because if they were closer to town they would have been caught with stolen gear. they got to play fireman deep in the bush believing they were helping the community all the while preventing air assets from being used, using equipment that could have been used to protect structures. this is the truth that needs to be shared. the rcmp overstepped their grounds but they did so because the theft is so rampant. thieves stole the fucking pumps from the scotch creek bridge for gods sakes. i implore anyone who has the courage to defy an evacuation order, join your local fire department. they will give you training! provide you with the organization to effectively deploy large amounts of manpower. you will get to stay and protect your community through evacuation orders. you will be allowed to move freely through town. its so easy. its so much easier than the alternative...hiding and skirting law enforcement without coordination and communication. fuck so much devastation, so much loss. so much manpower waisted i just cant take it. 5 days of 18 hour days working with people who lost their homes yet they still show up every day and will continue despite their fellow community members efforts to undermine their work. it's been a long time since i've cried this much.",britishcolumbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/15yxaap/the_second_best_time_to_be_a_volunteer_first/

' there's no way they can't find a new tenant by february 1st, as i live in metro vancouver and there's a high demand for apartments. plus the rents went up - they will be able to re-rent the unit by at least $200-300 extra each month. would be happy for any feedback from you folks, thanks!",britishcolumbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/102tbqp/breaking_a_fixed_term_tenancy_lease_with/

14l4bde,1687942935,concern about moving to bc,"hey all! i'm originally from québec and am looking for a new place to settle in canada. the west, for obvious reasons, has so much appeal, especially as someone who loves being outdoors and hiking. i would like to live in more rural areas. unfortunately, there's a huge drawback that i just can't shake: wildfires. i would love to hear locals' experiences on what it's like to live in a place with an increasing number of wildfires due to climate change. here are my concerns: how much do wildfires affect you? either directly through evacuations or indirectly through air quality. how often is there poor air quality in your area? i have had a hard time finding resources online indicating yearly recorded number of days of poor air quality in the province. i plan to be outside working in the garden a lot and being active. as someone with asthma, i believe that many days with poor air quality would seriously affect my health. all the information and resources you can provide would be incredibly appreciated! thanks",britishcolumbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/14l4bde/concern_about_moving_to_bc/

13da14a,1683675572,"**updated** 2 week itinerary: vancouver, sunshine coast, vancouver island/victoria, seattle","original post: [ a huge thank you to everyone who responded to my original post about our trip to the area in june - this community is great. we have made some changes to our travel route and wanted to share. we have had the flights and accommodations booked for some time but were able to make a few adjustments to the accommodations without an increase in cost. we also made sure that all ferry reservations were booked for the morning routes just in case there were issues and a later one was needed. we have not made any specific bookings for activities yet. instead we have made a list of possibilities for each day or area and, other than a few that will require booked appointments, are leaving it up to whatever we are up for on that particular day. we have no problem adding or dropping any ideas and honestly just doing this route and finding stuff on the way would be just as well. that being said, i would very much appreciate your help with additional suggestions of possible things to do or your thoughts/reviews on anything already listed that you think just aren't worth it. i have started making a list of already suggested food spots but would love to hear more of your favorite places as well (especially your go to asian food places and must have items). i know we are trying to get a lot in and could easily spend 1-2 weeks in many of these individual areas but are trying to make the most of our 2 weeks. thank you in advance for taking the time to read and provide your thoughts - you all have been awesome!!! &#x200b; *a little background on my family: i am originally from calgary and spent many years in southern alberta but have never been to vancouver or the surrounding area and we have been wanting to go for many years. i currently work and live down in the states in colorado. my family very much enjoys hiking and outdoor activities but we do not take many vacations. we all love museums, aquariums and anything to do with native culture as well as just enjoying and experiencing this beautiful world we live in. i have taken my girls back to southern alberta several times (i have to keep stocking up on my canadian goods) and then they have been to california a few times. we are finally in a position to take a trip and this is what we chose to experience together.* &#x200b; **---day 1 saturday** arrive sea-tac airport 9am, pick up rental and travel to vancouver rest of day vancouver area stay overnight downtown vancouver &#x200b; **---day 2 sunday** all day vancouver area stay overnight downtown vancouver &#x200b; **---day 3 monday** all day vancouver area stay overnight downtown vancouver &#x200b; ***(days 1-4 vancouver area tentative/possible things to do – richmond night market, international buddhist temple, vandusen botanical garden, granville island, stanley park, vancouver aquarium, museum of vancouver, vancouver art gallery, vancouver lookout, false creek ferry boats, capilano suspension bridge park, grouse mountain, lynn canyon)*** &#x200b; **---day 4 tuesday** leave vancouver area and travel to squamish area tentative/possible things to do - shannon falls, sea to sky gondola, smoke bluffs, girabaldi, whistler?
