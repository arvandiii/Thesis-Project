      "how to find safe/affordable housing for a senior who might resist? advice desperately needed, please. my father is a proud man in his mid-seventies in poor health. he has heart issues as well as some mobility issues (can walk, but has fallen and been unable to get up). he owns his own home on vancouver island in a smaller suburb, but it's in terrible shape as he is in no condition to keep the property in check (bordering on a hoarder situation, cobwebs everywhere, overgrown yard, etc.). the frontage is limited, but if you saw the back yard, you'd think the place was abandoned. i live on the mainland and am his only child relatively nearby. he is stubborn and suffers from mild agoraphobia and anxiety. but the thing i'm struggling the most to deal with is that he is not taking care of himself/his property. he is hugely avoidant (the mail piles up unopened for years). he's had his power shut off twice in the last year, leaving him scrambling to get it turned back on (he is a boomer and isn't great with technology to the point he couldn't figure out how to dial outside numbers on the cell phone he has). what scared me the most was last summer when his power went off the first time. he fell in his garage and smacked his head to the point that blood was everywhere. because he has cordless handsets, he couldn't use his landline to get help. he managed to finally prop himself up and crawl into his car and drove 45 minutes down the island highway to the nearest hospital. we only found out because i keep tabs on him and, when i couldn't find him, i called around to the nearby hospitals. this was utterly terrifying as he was in loads of danger with no way to reach out. and because i'm in the city, i have no way to get to him quickly/easily. getting his power turned back on (due to privacy restrictions with bc hydro) was a huge ordeal. i've offered to take on his utilities logins so i can keep on top of the payments and he insists that he will get autopay set up. he claims to have done this, but then his power got shut off again this morning and he managed to get ahold of me on his cell phone so i could merge in a call to bc hydro to get it set back up and turned on again. this has also happened with his internet and other utilities in the past. when my husband and i went to visit him for his birthday, i was horrified to discover that his auto insurance had expired three months earlier and he had been driving around uninsured. we marched him straight to icbc and got that fixed while we were there, but we can't count on him to be upfront about these things when we aren't (he only allows us to visit 1-2x per year). he owns his house outright, but has no income or significant savings. the house (a modest bungalow) is too much for him to manage and is costing him too much to heat/power/take care of. he forgot to fill out some important municipal forms/tax stuff and came \\*thisclose\\* to having the government selling his house out from underneath him. this isn't dementia or alzheimers - he just avoids a lot of these important tasks due to anxiety/depression. due to his health and (what i feel to be) the danger he poses to himself, i want to move him over to the mainland and get him into some sort of supportive housing for seniors. he doesn't need ltc (yet), but he needs an affordable option for seniors where he could maintain some independence, but also have me close enough by that i could get to him within an hour or two if something were to happen (and to keep on top of his living situation so it doesn't spiral out of control). the problem is that he thinks everything is fine and should keep on as it is. he shuts down any and every conversation that i try to broach with him about how his current way of living isn't working. which breaks my heart and has me swooping in to save him when these incidents happen. and i guess he's able-bodied enough that i can't force him to move. but even as-is, his house would need to be cleared out, repainted and fixed up before it could be sold. i want him to do that, live off the proceeds and rent for the rest of his life, but he claims he doesn't want to do that so he has something to leave me and my siblings (we are absolutely fine and do not need his money or assets). a house in a small suburb (of mainly retirees) on the island is obviously worth a fraction of vancouver prices, so he wouldn't be able to sell there and buy here. and rents here are out of control. he also doesn't really like vancouver (he has baggage), but i think i could get him set up in an older one-bedroom rental in white rock, squamish or maybe maple ridge? ultimately, i could really use some perspective and advice from anyone else who has experienced anything similar with elderly parents. i am woefully unfamiliar with the legal parameters as well as where to go and what to do. i'm sure that any affordable seniors housing has a significant waitlist, but i don't know where to start and googling has left me more confused than ever. and i don't want to take away his agency, but i also can't leave things as they are as he is apt to get hurt or worse. if anyone can offer up guidance or resources or even point me in the right direction of where to start looking, i'd be eternally grateful. i'm overwhelmed with my own life and work and so stressed and scared for him (not to mention the daunting feeling of trying to find affordable/available seniors housing in the lower mainland which is already outrageously expensive with inflation to boot). sorry this is so long, thank you so much for reading.\n",

      "the second best time to be a volunteer first responder is now. edit: this post has gained alot of traction and i want to reiterate that the only reason there isnt more destruction is because of the cooperation between fire fighters and the community. i was quite emotional when writing this and part of me wants to delete it but for now i will leave it up. thank you for all the supportive comments its appreciated. i am on the front lines in scotch creek and celista. i'm working with the fire departments and citizens to keep them fed and safe. the first day we had hundreds of people coming and going asking what they can do to help. every single one was defying the evacuation order to save their town. a noble and honourable act indeed. the fire chief meticulously took each ones names and numbers and relevant skills. they were told the best place to go to put out spot fires. they brought food and supplies to the firehall and were in turn fed and watered. they were an integral part of saving the town. i watched this unfold with my own eyes. so many people acting courageously when the time came. hundreds of people willing to risk their lives to protect their town, yet the volunteer fire departments total manpower is less than 20. it makes my blood absolutely boil. if even half of those 100 people had stepped up and received training they could have been infinitely more useful in slowing the fires. the #1 problem they had was manpower. they had hundreds of people available willing to fight but all that manpower is useless without the communication and organization that is needed to actually properly fight the fires. i have the utmost respect for each one of those citizens and i beg beg beg anyone who feels that they have the strength and courage to defy an evacuation order to protect their town to join the fucking agencies that are dedicated to do that exact thing. if they had 100 volunteer firefighters with 100 radios they could justify the expense of 100 sets of gear, more trucks, more equipment. instead we had locals fighting fires in the middle of the bush when houses were burning. we had air assets available to deploy but they couldnt because locals were in the middle of the forest fighting fires. i'm not even going into the thefts because desperate people saving their homes do desperate things. its despicable, but i can at least emphasize with it. what absolutely enraged me was finding a group of locals 10km from town fighting a fire using obviously stolen equipment in an area where no structures were at risk. they were there because if they were closer to town they would have been caught with stolen gear. they got to play fireman deep in the bush believing they were helping the community all the while preventing air assets from being used, using equipment that could have been used to protect structures. this is the truth that needs to be shared. the rcmp overstepped their grounds but they did so because the theft is so rampant. thieves stole the fucking pumps from the scotch creek bridge for gods sakes. i implore anyone who has the courage to defy an evacuation order, join your local fire department. they will give you training! provide you with the organization to effectively deploy large amounts of manpower. you will get to stay and protect your community through evacuation orders. you will be allowed to move freely through town. its so easy. its so much easier than the alternative...hiding and skirting law enforcement without coordination and communication. fuck so much devastation, so much loss. so much manpower waisted i just cant take it. 5 days of 18 hour days working with people who lost their homes yet they still show up every day and will continue despite their fellow community members efforts to undermine their work. it's been a long time since i've cried this much.\n",

(my parents are traveling to vancouver, driving to calgary). my parents are traveling to canada from michigan next week and driving from vancouver to calgary, stopping in a few towns along the way (kamloops, banff, etc). they were at the windsor casino yesterday and someone told them that wildfires may cause some travel issues. google maps does warn about the adam’s complex fires that may disrupt the trip. i’ve never had to plan a trip through wildfire areas! i don’t know if that warning on google means people should absolutely not drive that route, or it’s something you can do with caution? i want to make sure my folks respect any official recommendations, and adjust their plans accordingly. any guidance, links to resources would be greatly appreciated! edit: thank you all for the information! i’ll let them know about the situation so they can plan a different route! i’m sad to hear about all the fires. my best wishes to those affected, and hope all turns out well.\n",

      "rethink itinerary kootenays, okanagan beginning of september first of all i my thoughts are to all the people who are living near wildfires which are currently taken place. hopefully you all are as fine as possible. we are a couple from austria which travels to canada next week. our first idea was to stay at my gf brother's place in calgary and visit banff, jasper and drumheller. usually we do like hiking, nature, food and wine on our vacation. afterwards our plan was to drive from calgary to vancouver (31.8. to 7.9) stay in vancouver for two days and then head home to austria on 9.9. stops were few areas in the kootenay region and okanagan valley. we already have a car rental booked. however, since the recent wildfires in kelowna we do not want to stay there anymore due to not block any homes for people who need to be evacuated. not sure if it even would be possible for us to stay there on 4th of september die to the travel ban for tourists in that area. therefore we think about to rearrange our whole trip between calgary and vancouver. we have some options but do not know if they make any sense. option 1: still visit kootenays and maybe watertown lakes national park and then head to vancouver. some risks would include: road blocks due to fires, and smoke in the kootenays since there also are wildfires. does anyone know how the situation is there? we'd like to visit cranbrook, nelson, ainsworth kasko and nakusp. option 2: cancel the car rental and fly to vancouver directly. than book a car rental in vancouver and visit vancouver island instead for the remaining time. however, vancouver island seems much more expensive than kootenays. option 3: not sure exactly. maybe drive via hwy1 and stop somewhere in between. like golden revelstoke and do the sea to sky highway. since this all is quite spontaneous we are a bit overwhelmed with the options and would like to rebook everything by tomorrow if possible. hopefully some of you has some insights and tips for us. thank you in advance and stay strong! edit: first of all we are overwhelmed by the number of replies. unfortunately i am not able to answer all of you, but i wanted to say, that we are going by option b. it is more expensive, but it is the safer bet. we booked mostly lodges and flights which we could cancel at any given time if something changes.\n",
