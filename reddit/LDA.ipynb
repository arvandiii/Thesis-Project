      "how to find safe/affordable housing for a senior who might resist? advice desperately needed, please. my father is a proud man in his mid-seventies in poor health. he has heart issues as well as some mobility issues (can walk, but has fallen and been unable to get up). he owns his own home on vancouver island in a smaller suburb, but it's in terrible shape as he is in no condition to keep the property in check (bordering on a hoarder situation, cobwebs everywhere, overgrown yard, etc.). the frontage is limited, but if you saw the back yard, you'd think the place was abandoned. i live on the mainland and am his only child relatively nearby. he is stubborn and suffers from mild agoraphobia and anxiety. but the thing i'm struggling the most to deal with is that he is not taking care of himself/his property. he is hugely avoidant (the mail piles up unopened for years). he's had his power shut off twice in the last year, leaving him scrambling to get it turned back on (he is a boomer and isn't great with technology to the point he couldn't figure out how to dial outside numbers on the cell phone he has). what scared me the most was last summer when his power went off the first time. he fell in his garage and smacked his head to the point that blood was everywhere. because he has cordless handsets, he couldn't use his landline to get help. he managed to finally prop himself up and crawl into his car and drove 45 minutes down the island highway to the nearest hospital. we only found out because i keep tabs on him and, when i couldn't find him, i called around to the nearby hospitals. this was utterly terrifying as he was in loads of danger with no way to reach out. and because i'm in the city, i have no way to get to him quickly/easily. getting his power turned back on (due to privacy restrictions with bc hydro) was a huge ordeal. i've offered to take on his utilities logins so i can keep on top of the payments and he insists that he will get autopay set up. he claims to have done this, but then his power got shut off again this morning and he managed to get ahold of me on his cell phone so i could merge in a call to bc hydro to get it set back up and turned on again. this has also happened with his internet and other utilities in the past. when my husband and i went to visit him for his birthday, i was horrified to discover that his auto insurance had expired three months earlier and he had been driving around uninsured. we marched him straight to icbc and got that fixed while we were there, but we can't count on him to be upfront about these things when we aren't (he only allows us to visit 1-2x per year). he owns his house outright, but has no income or significant savings. the house (a modest bungalow) is too much for him to manage and is costing him too much to heat/power/take care of. he forgot to fill out some important municipal forms/tax stuff and came \\*thisclose\\* to having the government selling his house out from underneath him. this isn't dementia or alzheimers - he just avoids a lot of these important tasks due to anxiety/depression. due to his health and (what i feel to be) the danger he poses to himself, i want to move him over to the mainland and get him into some sort of supportive housing for seniors. he doesn't need ltc (yet), but he needs an affordable option for seniors where he could maintain some independence, but also have me close enough by that i could get to him within an hour or two if something were to happen (and to keep on top of his living situation so it doesn't spiral out of control). the problem is that he thinks everything is fine and should keep on as it is. he shuts down any and every conversation that i try to broach with him about how his current way of living isn't working. which breaks my heart and has me swooping in to save him when these incidents happen. and i guess he's able-bodied enough that i can't force him to move. but even as-is, his house would need to be cleared out, repainted and fixed up before it could be sold. i want him to do that, live off the proceeds and rent for the rest of his life, but he claims he doesn't want to do that so he has something to leave me and my siblings (we are absolutely fine and do not need his money or assets). a house in a small suburb (of mainly retirees) on the island is obviously worth a fraction of vancouver prices, so he wouldn't be able to sell there and buy here. and rents here are out of control. he also doesn't really like vancouver (he has baggage), but i think i could get him set up in an older one-bedroom rental in white rock, squamish or maybe maple ridge? ultimately, i could really use some perspective and advice from anyone else who has experienced anything similar with elderly parents. i am woefully unfamiliar with the legal parameters as well as where to go and what to do. i'm sure that any affordable seniors housing has a significant waitlist, but i don't know where to start and googling has left me more confused than ever. and i don't want to take away his agency, but i also can't leave things as they are as he is apt to get hurt or worse. if anyone can offer up guidance or resources or even point me in the right direction of where to start looking, i'd be eternally grateful. i'm overwhelmed with my own life and work and so stressed and scared for him (not to mention the daunting feeling of trying to find affordable/available seniors housing in the lower mainland which is already outrageously expensive with inflation to boot). sorry this is so long, thank you so much for reading.\n",

      "things to do for a solo traveler in and around kelowna? i posted a couple days ago about the wildfires and i've been told i'm in the clear to come visit! i've got a few things planned out for my trip already but i'm looking to fill a couple days. i'm a solo male in my late 20s so keep in mind it has to be solo friendly and i don't mind if i have to drive a couple hours to get somewhere. i'm basically looking for a locals view on what's good to do in the area. just to help out with recommendations, i'm looking to do some hiking or other outdoors activities like beginner mountain biking and kayaking, i'm a really big foodie so any hidden gems would be lovely, i'm hoping to enjoy the nightlife a bit as well i've heard good things about a place called bna but nothing else. everybody has been so helpful and friendly on my last post so i'm getting really excited for my visit! any suggestions would be very appreciated!! thanks everyone!!\n",
