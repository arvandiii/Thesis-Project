for others, the loss of these applications represents a familiar and well-known interface with recognizable features and navigation which is lacking in the current reddit application. additional concerns remain about the future of moderation tools, and other features that many subreddits use to enhance their communities. while reddit has made concessions on some items the apathy from reddit

reminder of what makes the platform unique. however meaningful action has not occurred, and we are still looking for reddit to address these outstanding issues. as members of the reddit moderation council and as a partner community, we are committed to continuing to engage directly with admins to discuss and emphasize these concerns. we expect reddit to make good on its commitments to improve accessibility and to engage with honesty and good faith with third-party developers. **there is still sufficient time for this to be rectified before the proposed changes are implemented, and we will continue to monitor the situation as time passes.** thousands of subreddits are continuing to participate in the protest, while some others are not. this continues to be an important issue to ensure

ideas and suggestions from the community in promoting awareness for these issues while balancing the continued desire for many to engage in this community.** ______________________________________ # updated content guidelines as we reopen the subreddit, we would also like to take this opportunity to share some updates for r/canada. ## 1. user set post flairs as of right now, post flairs are set by automoderator based on keyword strings, but often require manual updates by moderators for accuracy. in the coming days to allow users and content posters to more accurately represent their content, users will be prompted to select a post flair in at the time of submission. we will be looking to participate in the [post guidance pilot]( which will further support this and other improvements. ## 2. post restriction on opinion/oped content for some time there has been ongoing discussion and comments raised about submission content, specifically opinion articles and related content. as one of the largest canadian-themed subreddits we have aimed to allow for broad perspectives and content from mainstream media sources and avoiding fringe or independent media sources. in doing so, we have aimed to promote mainstream content which faces stringent editorial review and follows industry best practices. like most other discussion-based subreddits, we aim to reduce duplicate posts and avoid individualized stories from dominating the subreddit. the unintended consequence of this has been an overamplification of opinion posts. many users have raised their frustrations and concerns about this to us, and it has been an issue of significant discussion within the moderation team. we believe that users here should be able to promote canadian stories and discuss their experiences and topics that affect them across this broad and diverse nation of ours. as such we are always hesitant to stifle discussion and reduce the opportunities to engage and discuss in good faith. while we want to hope that all here will participate in good faith, we recognize that this is impractical. in order to balance good faith engagement and participation against divisive and bad faith engagement, we will be aiming to introduce an additional change to the content approval process on the subreddit. in order to target bad faith actors, bots, ban evaders, and reduce duplicate posts, the submission of opinion/columnist articles will be limited to accounts with verified emails associated with their account. opinion submissions submitted from non-verified accounts will be subject to auto-moderator or moderator removal. this will also be a requirement within the comments for these posts as well. this will allow regular and positively engaging users to continue to participate and foster discussions on topics that interest them while targeting bad actors. we hope this approach when paired with reddit’s ban evasion and new content filters; will strike a balance between enabling discussion and targeting higher-risk activity. this is not intended to limit ""free speech"" but to ensure engagement comes from engaged individuals who take the time to participate in the community and maintain an account in good standing. we will monitor these changes to see if they are successful and have a positive impact. ## 3. in comment gifs. for those of you who use the reddit app or ""new reddit"", gify keyboard support is now enabled on the subreddit and supporting gif comments. we will give it a go, in hope that it can lighten the engagement and drive participation. please note that the same rules which apply to comments will also apply to the use of gifs ## 4. publisher-promoted content we have experienced significant outreach from various publishers seeking to post their content directly on the subreddit. however, as highlighted above, we aim to promote user-posted and driven content on the subreddit to allow members of the community to share the content that interests them. we have asked publishers to engage in comments and directly with the community as members themselves before seeking to post content. this includes letters to the editor, newsletters, blog posts, and “roll-ups” hosted on various publishers’ websites. as mentioned in subreddit rules, low content such as fringe and independent media posts remains outside of approved submission content. ______________________________________ at the heart of reddit’s vision and outlook is “remember the human.” we recognize that the blackout was an undesirable disruption to your routine, how you consume news and interact with others. please remember that as we re-engage and discuss ideas that a person is at the other end of the discussion. while we encourage healthy debate and disagreements on ideas, it is important to engage in these discussions in a respectful and non-hostile manner.",canada,welcome back

this to us, and it has been an issue of significant discussion within the moderation team. we believe that users here should be able to promote canadian stories and discuss their experiences and topics that affect them across this broad and diverse nation of ours. as such we are always hesitant to stifle discussion and reduce the opportunities to engage and discuss in good faith. while we want to hope that all here will participate in good faith, we recognize that this is impractical. in order to balance good faith engagement and participation against divisive and bad faith engagement, we will be aiming to introduce an additional change to the content approval process on the subreddit. in order to target bad faith actors, bots, ban evaders, and reduce duplicate posts, the submission of opinion/columnist articles will be limited to accounts with verified emails associated with their account. opinion submissions submitted from non-verified accounts will be subject to auto-moderator or moderator removal. this will also be a requirement within the comments for these posts as well. this will allow regular and positively engaging users to continue to participate and foster discussions on topics that interest them while targeting bad actors. we hope this approach when paired with reddit’s ban evasion and new content filters; will strike a balance between enabling discussion and targeting higher-risk activity. this is not intended to limit ""free speech"" but to ensure engagement comes from engaged individuals who take the time to participate in the community and maintain an account in good standing. we will monitor these changes to see if they are successful and have a positive impact. ## 3. in comment gifs. for those of you who use the reddit app or ""new reddit"", gify keyboard support is now enabled on the subreddit and supporting gif comments. we will give it a go, in hope that it can lighten the engagement and drive participation. please note that the same rules which apply to comments will also apply to the use of gifs ## 4. publisher-promoted content we have experienced significant outreach from various publishers seeking to post their content directly on the subreddit. however, as highlighted above, we aim to promote user-posted and driven content on the subreddit to allow members of the community to share the content that interests them. we have asked publishers to engage in comments and directly with the community as members themselves before seeking to post content. this includes letters to the editor, newsletters, blog posts, and “roll-ups” hosted on various publishers’ websites. as mentioned in subreddit rules, low content such as fringe and independent media posts remains outside of approved submission content. ______________________________________ at the heart of reddit’s vision and outlook is “remember the human.” we recognize that the blackout was an undesirable disruption to your routine, how you consume news and interact with others. please remember that as we re-engage and discuss ideas that a person is at the other end of the discussion. while we encourage healthy debate and disagreements on ideas, it is important to engage in these discussions in a respectful and non-hostile manner.",welcom back rcanada good morn afternoon friend welcom back blackout subreddit someth

bike lane situation + the stanley park thing as well so decided to get out and ride a bike along with about a hundred other people. numbers were actually pretty good - along with this, it was a nice mild sunny day so i had my first day this year riding in a t-shirt and shorts, and i saw many others doing the same. a perfect day for cm really. we started off at the art gallery, as usual, and then headed along hornby towards the granville bridge, where we stopped for a minute to let everyone catch up and do a chicago bike hold-up. then we proceeded onto broadway for a few km, going back on the cambie bridge, and then after some riding along w georgia the mass decided to go over the burrard bridge onto cornwall ave, where a 5 year old was seriously injured by a speeding car this past summer. after this, we headed back onto broadway and ended the ride at olympic village, so we did around 30km more or less. i really liked how the mass decided to focus their attention on routes that had sub-par or non-existent bike infrastructure; biking on broadway and seeing all the bikes and shops around me without having to worry about being hit by a car was a pretty euphoric feeling. along with cornwall ave, where community members have been advocating for lower speed limits as it passes through pedestrian heavy vibrant neighbourhoods - and of course, again, a 5 year old kid was almost killed by a speeding car while she was standing on the sidewalk. overall morale was pretty good, i'd say. most drivers were very supportive and we got a nice stream of friendly honks going for quite a while. there wasn't really any antagonizing of drivers or starting fights for no reason - everyone was just there to have their voices heard, and to have fun. and yes, we did let road cyclists pass, for the naysayers. of course, when you have a big enough mass, you've gotta start corking - and i was one of the corkers for about half of the red lights we passed through. 99% of the time, drivers simply waited patiently for the mass to pass through the intersection, which we were very thankful for. there was only one time where a taxi driver started laying on his horn and yelling, and we simply responded with clapping and positivity. remember, corking allows the entire mass to clear the intersection faster than if we had split up into multiple groups, and it keeps people safer as cars aren't trying to force their way through the group. if you ever get caught in a cm, please be patient - i'm sure you're able to wait a minute. there was one time where a fire truck was zoomin down the road and it was almost like moses parting the sea, the way a hundred people all moved over to the right at the same time in order to clear a lane to let them through. ironically, because of us, the fire truck most likely made it to its destination quicker than if the street had been filled up with cars all trying to get out of the way. there were also two times on broadway where some idiots in luxury suvs decided to cross the yellow line into *oncoming traffic* in order to pass the mass and there was one instance where they got trapped by an oncoming car and had to sort of force-merge their way back into our lanes. it's very telling where motorists' priorities are when they'll happily wait in rush hour traffic twice a day five days a week, but as soon as they get delayed for 5 minutes by anyone who isn't in a car, they'll start performing dangerous maneuvers and using their vehicle as a weapon to force their way past other people. we're just as entitled to the road as much as they are. when people go ""but you don't need bike lanes on broadway!!11!11"", this is literally a prime example of why we do. cars and bikes just don't mix well. it was a great feeling to take back our

apologies!) edit: just realized i posted the title going backwards whoops! given the heavy smoke expected in the next few days and having nothing to do on a friday night, i decided to loop the central valley greenway (cvg) and bc parkway (bcp) tonight from commercial and broadway to new westminster. earlier this week someone was discussing the awkward rupert station transition (it's gotten worse!) but there's other screwy spots that make this an intermediate/advanced ride, which is a shame because this could otherwise be a really fun day trip/outing. the following is a pretty comprehensive review bcp eastbound vancouver - 8/10 overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride in vancouver proper. heading through trout lake on the dedicated bike path is pretty easy and people generally stick to the gravel pedestrian path. there's a short but steep climb between 19th and stainsbury to reconnect with the skytrain line at nanaimo. the bike path at nanaimo has been really improved recently, with clear separated lanes to a dedicated incline at nanaimo station up to slocan st. there's an awkward transition at slocan to 29th ave that requires a bit of road use, but then the dedicated path behind 29th is pretty well developed and spills on to vaness, which is not a busy road when it needs to be taken. passing joyce station i find it much simpler to take venables st to boundary than the separated bike path because of heavy pedestrian use, and relatively light vehicle traffic with intersections only on the south side. bcp burnaby - 6/10 similar heavy pedestrian use on the path in central park path with no real work around. the metrotown area again has heavy shared pedestrian use on the bike path, and i found it was better to ride beresford alongside very light traffic. crossing the road at willingdon requires a lot of caution. the transition at central blvd and imperial has been improved from a very thin awkward sidewalk riding against traffic, it's been widened with a vehicle fence which feels so much safer. once you get back on the parkway the ride gets pretty choppy with many busy and undeveloped vehicles crossings that require a lot of caution until you return to beresford. i also found the road to be better than the bike path, although i've taken both without issue. the traffic is very light and there's no absent minded pedestrians. crossing to prenter st the path gets very narrow, with construction entirely blocking a transition on to the bike path. edmonds station gets very nice again with a short dip through a park and a dedicated path behind the skytrain maintenance yard.. the path is winding with a steep decline, so it's definitely best to have the brakes ready! overall this stretch is a real joy until 22nd station in new westminster. bcp new westminster - 4/10 what. the. fuck. as soon as you get across 22nd station you're riding a thin sidewalk along stewardson, which is the bcp in both directions and the only pedestrian sidewalk. thankfully i was the only using it at the time. lots of intersections to be cautious of right turning drivers along. this is not a safe path to ride, use a lot of caution. once you get to quayside things open up a bit again with shared road and light vehicle traffic. there's one section of diagonal train tracks to watch out for along this stretch lest you catch a wheel! crossing the train tracks to columbia st leads to a nice separated bike path downtown, the transition to the cvg at the patullo. cvg new west (westbound) - 4/10 things are really nice until you pass the patullo. then you're stuck on a thin stretch of sidewalk with only plastic pylon barriers, riding against traffic until mcbride st. this section is very unsafe to navigate without a lot of caution, nerve wracking, it's a busy road and there's nothing but a few plastic bumpers between you and the oncoming traffic. things get nice and riding through the park at victoria hill, only to end up back against traffic, crossing driveways and intersections on the sidewalk at e columbia.... not ideal but not scary like the previous, and next part. as soon as you cross cumberland st there's about two blocks of incredibly narrow shared use sidewalk, with pedestrians and two way bike traffic for about 200m. like this would be nerve wracking to walk along if it was busy, much less ride. i would even have trouble dismounting safely here, so thankfully there was no pedestrians. then there's a massive hill to climb on e columbia heading to royal columbian, followed by a downhill to catch your breath at kelly st. following kelly to hume park the cvg gets a dedicated lane again, which is a nice descent that wraps around the park to the bottom of e columbia/north road. a clear crossing, a slight separated path, then you're back on the sidewalk against traffic on north road. with no signage to tell you to follow a dim path east off north road on a gravel path, i lost the connection and ended up taking lougheed highway to vancouver. cvg burnaby - 8/10 again i missed the connection and ended up going against traffic on north road until getting to a bunch of parking lots, where i took a break and walked it through. however i've ridden the burnaby portion of the cvg before and can say that this is a much nicer bike path with dedicated trails through burnaby lake and shared lane with light traffic along winston and still creek. the only issues that really presents itself with crossings is an awkward intersection at douglas rd and still creek. there's no simple way to navigate this intersection so use caution. i'm also not a huge fan of separated lanes running along sidewalks that cross parking lots, so tend to just use still creek when traffic is light. the little path connecting gilmore is really cool, but it tends to flood in the spring/fall. a little path behind the home depot to boundary, and a large crossing with a pedestrian light connect to vancouver. honestly pretty good! cvg vancouver - 8/10 honestly this path is generally well thought out and straightforward with very few inclines. it's one of the ideal bike paths i've seen in this city with minimal light shared road use except for rupert station. you may as well just walk it right now anyways, since the east side of the street next to the station is barricaded to dismount anyways. a steady incline to nanaimo st (felt brutal by this point haha) and then a mix of dedicated and traffic controlled lanes to e 10th ave. technically the path crosses broadway here and continues left on 8th, but for transit connection go left. there's an awkward hard left turn and a mixed use pedestrian crossing, but the short stretch of 10th between victoria and commercial has again been greatly improved.",vancouver,cycling review (long): central valley to bc parkway loop,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/15v8sue/cycling_review_long_central_valley_to_bc_parkway/,"cycling review (long): central valley to bc parkway loop (long read, my apologies!) edit: just realized i posted the title going backwards whoops! given the heavy smoke expected in the next few days and having nothing to do on a friday night, i decided to loop the central valley greenway (cvg) and bc parkway (bcp) tonight from commercial and broadway to new westminster. earlier this week someone was discussing the awkward rupert station transition (it's gotten worse!) but there's other screwy spots that make this an intermediate/advanced ride, which is a shame because this could otherwise be a really fun day trip/outing. the following is a pretty comprehensive review bcp eastbound vancouver - 8/10 overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride in vancouver proper. heading through trout lake on the dedicated bike path is pretty easy and people generally stick to the gravel pedestrian path. there's a short but steep climb between 19th and stainsbury to reconnect with the skytrain line at nanaimo. the bike path at nanaimo has been really improved recently, with clear separated lanes to a dedicated incline at nanaimo station up to slocan st. there's an awkward transition at slocan to 29th ave that requires a bit of road use, but then the dedicated path behind 29th is pretty well developed and spills on to vaness, which is not a busy road when it needs to be taken. passing joyce station i find it much simpler to take venables st to boundary than the separated bike path because of heavy pedestrian use, and relatively light vehicle traffic with intersections only on the south side. bcp burnaby - 6/10 similar heavy pedestrian use on the path in central park path with no real work around. the metrotown area again has heavy shared pedestrian use on the bike path, and i found it was better to ride beresford alongside very light traffic. crossing the road at willingdon requires a lot of caution. the transition at central blvd and imperial has been improved from a very thin awkward sidewalk riding against traffic, it's been widened with a vehicle fence which feels so much safer. once you get back on the parkway the ride gets pretty choppy with many busy and undeveloped vehicles crossings that require a lot of caution until you return to beresford. i also found the road to be better than the bike path, although i've taken both without issue. the traffic is very light and there's no absent minded pedestrians. crossing to prenter st the path gets very narrow, with construction entirely blocking a transition on to the bike path. edmonds station gets very nice again with a short dip through a park and a dedicated path behind the skytrain maintenance yard.. the path is winding with a steep decline, so it's definitely best to have the brakes ready! overall this stretch is a real joy until 22nd station in new westminster. bcp new westminster - 4/10 what. the. fuck. as soon as you get across 22nd station you're riding a thin sidewalk along stewardson, which is the bcp in both directions and the only pedestrian sidewalk. thankfully i was the only using it at the time. lots of intersections to be cautious of right turning drivers along. this is not a safe path to ride, use a lot of caution. once you get to quayside things open up a bit again with shared road and light vehicle traffic. there's one section of diagonal train tracks to watch out for along this stretch lest you catch a wheel! crossing the train tracks to columbia st leads to a nice separated bike path downtown, the transition to the cvg at the patullo. cvg new west (westbound) - 4/10 things are really nice until you pass the patullo. then you're stuck on a thin stretch of sidewalk with only plastic pylon barriers, riding against traffic until mcbride st. this section is very unsafe to navigate without a lot of caution, nerve wracking, it's a busy road and there's nothing but a few plastic bumpers between you and the oncoming traffic. things get nice and riding through the park at victoria hill, only to end up back against traffic, crossing driveways and intersections on the sidewalk at e columbia.... not ideal but not scary like the previous, and next part. as soon as you cross cumberland st there's about two blocks of incredibly narrow shared use sidewalk, with pedestrians and two way bike traffic for about 200m. like this would be nerve wracking to walk along if it was busy, much less ride. i would even have trouble dismounting safely here, so thankfully there was no pedestrians. then there's a massive hill to climb on e columbia heading to royal columbian, followed by a downhill to catch your breath at kelly st. following kelly to hume park the cvg gets a dedicated lane again, which is a nice descent that wraps around the park to the bottom of e columbia/north road. a clear crossing, a slight separated path, then you're back on the sidewalk against traffic on north road. with no signage to tell you to follow a dim path east off north road on

14th at 1pm, city council is holding a [public hearing]( concerning amendments to the zoning bylaw which would make it easier to build ""missing middle"" housing. if you don't usually or haven't ever participated in a public hearing, this would be a fantastic one to make your first as it has significant implications for denser housing developments in the city. if you aren't interested in speaking, council makes it easy to communicate your support/opposition [in writing]( (put adding missing middle housing and simplifying regulations – amendments to the zoning and development by-law in the subject field). this was already posted [a few days ago]( but i wanted to write up a summary to better inform people because, again, this is a *really* important proposal. in short, if passed, this application would (among many other things - i strongly recommend reading pages 7-17 of the [referral report]( for a more detailed overview): **1. allow for the construction of ""missing middle"" residential buildings on lots zoned for single detached houses.** current zoning laws generally allow only for either a single detached house or a duplex to be constructed in rs zones alongside secondary units (laneway houses and basement suites). the vast majority of the city is zoned under one of nine different rs zoning types, meaning any construction denser than a duplex needs to go through a lengthy hearing process without a guaranteed outcome. this proposal would amend the zoning and development by-law to permit construction of up to 4 units on a standard lot (minimum 306m2, 64% of rs lots), 5 units on mid-size lots (minimum 464m2, 13.6% of rs lots), 6 units on larger lots (minimum 557m2, 22.4% of rs lots), and up to 8 units on larger lots when the construction includes purpose-built rental housing. these new higher-density constructions would have a maximum floor space ratio (fsr) of 1.0, meaning that the maximum total usable floor space of these buildings would be the total area of the lot they're built on. however, new constructions with an fsr of 0.7-1.0 would need to pay a ""density bonus contribution"", a fee tied to the total square footage of the construction which scales with the number of units and the geographic area of the construction (see page 15 of the [referral report]( new constructions would have this fee waived if they include at least one unit at below-market prices, or secure every unit as purpose-built rentals. all constructions would be limited to three stories. **2. consolidate the nine different single detached house zoning types into a single new zoning type (r1-1)** **3. reduce the maximum size of new single detached houses** all new constructions of single detached houses would have their maximum fsr reduced

process is a significant bureaucratic hurdle to denser housing constructions, and removing it will vastly speed up construction. this also means that these constructions will not be subject to the frustrating rezoning hearing process. however, this is still removing only one bureaucratic hurdle of many. * i'd like to see this proposal go a bit further. you can fit a lot more than 6 units in a 3 story apartment when the lot is large enough, so increasing the number of units allowable on the particularly large lots around the city would be a nice addition to this proposal. * the 1.0 fsr is too small for these constructions, and is the part of this application i'm most annoyed at. fsr for middle-density constructions needs to be bumped above 1.0, particularly for higher-density constructions. if the maximum single detached house fsr gets reduced to 0.6, this means you could potentially be building 8x the units on in only 1.65x the space, or only 1.15x if you want to avoid paying additional fees. this is how we get smaller, cramped units, which may not incentivize developers enough to construct middle-density housing. * the ""density bonus contribution"" is the second thing i'm unhappy with, particularly the fee scaling with unit numbers and geographic location. essentially, this disincentivizes developers against both building denser developments (which is against the whole point of this proposal!) and building them where they're needed most (in the west side, aka area a). given that margins for infill housing are already [pretty tight]( (shoutout /u/russilwvong), this really strikes me as a poison pill clause, where council wants to be seen as taking action to promote middle-density developments, but doesn't actually want them to be built for fear of angering their voter base. indeed, give the bc government's upcoming requirement to allow 4 units on lots zoned for detached homes, this seems like council's attempt to restrict construction while still complying with the provincial government's regulations. * the consolidation of single detached house zoning types is sorely needed and a good step in the right direction for reducing and clarifying zoning rules. this should make constructions slightly easier, though likely not faster (which is what's really needed). * reducing the maximum size of single detached houses is... fine? i guess? it's an interesting thing to tag on here. this should disincentivize people from buying up lots for houses for sale just to rebuild them into larger houses, and instead incentivize building denser multi-unit constructions. but, if this is council's goal, there's better and more effective ways to go about this. * the increased size of laneway houses is a very welcome change for laneways that actually get built, but this doesn't solve the primary issue with laneway construction which is the absurd approval process and timeline. but hey, this is still a nice addition. in conclusion, there's a lot to like about this application, and a few things that could do with some changing before council approves it. but it's important to note that this is only one step towards getting more middle-density constructions going in this city; council still needs to work on improving permitting timelines and reducing other bureaucratic hurdles developers face when trying to construct denser infill housing. regardless, this is still a good step in the right direction.",vancouver,"some more details on council's upcoming ""missing middle"" proposal and hearing",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/16bouyl/some_more_details_on_councils_upcoming_missing/,"some more details on council's upcoming ""missing middle"" proposal and hearing on september 14th at 1pm, city council is holding a [public hearing]( concerning amendments to the zoning bylaw which would make it easier to build ""missing middle"" housing. if you don't usually or haven't ever participated in a public hearing, this would be a fantastic one to make your first as it has significant implications for denser housing developments in the city. if you aren't interested in speaking, council makes it easy to communicate your support/opposition [in writing]( (put adding missing middle housing and simplifying regulations – amendments to the zoning and development by-law in the subject field). this was already posted [a few days ago]( but i wanted to write up a summary to better inform people because, again, this is a *really* important proposal. in short, if passed, this application would (among many other things - i strongly recommend reading pages 7-17 of the [referral report]( for a more detailed overview): **1. allow for the construction of ""missing middle"" residential buildings on lots zoned for single detached houses.** current zoning laws generally allow only for either a single detached house or a duplex to be constructed in rs zones alongside secondary units (laneway houses and basement suites). the vast majority of the city is zoned under one of nine different rs zoning types, meaning any construction denser than a duplex needs to go through a lengthy hearing process without a guaranteed outcome. this proposal would amend the zoning and development by-law to permit construction of up to 4 units on a standard lot (minimum 306m2, 64% of rs lots), 5 units on mid-size lots (minimum 464m2, 13.6% of rs lots), 6 units on larger lots (minimum 557m2, 22.4% of rs lots), and up to 8 units on larger lots when the construction includes

[this sign was 150k]( i started this project with one of the best possible scenarios - i was given a lead time of almost 6 months before my lease commenced. my connection to a construction company owner got me acquainted with competent architects and engineers. the city of new west was particularly willing to help, given the need for childcare for the infant/toddler age bracket in the area. the space i am leasing is properly zones and didn't need major overhauls. even with all that considered, it was still a steep price just to get to this point. before a single proverbial brick can be laid (wooden building you see). moving to the implementation phase, strict guidelines equated to higher costs. i found myself accountable to various stakeholders - from city officials and fraser health to the building owners and the government's childcare funding arm. additionally, staffing became a challenge as well. factor in inspections, liaising with construction teams, and maintaining solvency, and it's a daunting task. i continue to have a full time job as a software engineer and my wife still has her current daycares to run. the funding scheme is beneficial for parents, but it's riddled with challenges. the issue with funding and how everything is set up, is that most projects simply cannot be made viable under their guidelines for what we are allowed to charge. a prime example: in specific locations where establishing a center is already tough, the maximum charge is pegged at $1485. with subsidies covering $900, parents shell out roughly $600. even if parents were willing to pay more, say $700, the system doesn't permit it. this financial strain is exacerbated when trying to pay staff a living wage. our infant/toddler staff, for instance, earns between $28-$32/hr inclusive of benefits and government wage subsidies. we could pay less, but that means they cant afford to eat and we just propagate the current problems. we need staff to be happy and have a place to live, taking care of young children is very demanding; both us as owners and the families in our centres want the staff to be happy. commercial leasing intensifies these challenges. unlike residential leases, there's no protective oversight, just negotiations between owners and tenants. due to current real-estate conditions, it's incredibly one-sided (i will let you guess which side has all the power). to counterbalance costs, centers often impose miscellaneous charges, like application fees or meal plans. while these might be written off by some as it's just the cost of daycare; subsidized families bear the brunt. this is because subsidy doesn't always cover these if they're additional fees rather than the base fee. so for example now they'd have to prepare lunches and snacks every morning before daycare, which is pretty hard when you have to get the child and yourself ready and drop them off to daycare and get to work. on the topic of waitlists and application fees, they do serve a purpose. numerous parents apply to multiple centers, leading to administrative hassles. such fees can ensure genuine interest, improving efficiency. we have not had issues and do no charge for meal plans or applications fees, field trips etc. i feel like the price should be simple and straightforward so everyone can budget properly. but, due to the funding guidelines, i might be forced to add a meal plan for the new centre as it's just not viable otherwise and i'm pretty sure not all 48 parents want to pack lunches and snacks every day. i think that roughly sums it up. i hate posts that complain without offering any solution, so here are mine: 1. **stabilizing the economic environment:** if the government wishes to standardize pricing, they must also stabilize factors affecting costs, like sudden interest rate hikes. 2. **supportive financing:** propose special, low-volatility loans with competitive interest rates for budding childcare centers. 3. **focused grants:** prioritize grants for areas with pressing childcare needs. there are some grants for nonprofits. but the ceiling to qualify is nearly impossible; i believe it only pertains to churches, schools and govt agencies. 4. **government-led initiatives:** instead of the current setup where the govt wants to control prices but not deal with any of the risk or management, the could allocate park land for non-profit childcare centers and allow private management. supplying the proper space while controlling what the lease for it is will remove a lot of variables and make this actually work. birth rates are declining because raising children is just absurdly expensive and hard. most families require that both parents work to afford to live; maternity leave is a pittance in most cases. if this does not get addressed and more done to encourage and support families to have children, our future does not look too bright. fun facts: - we are not allowed to advertise or accept applicants before fraser health issues a license. - with the above consideration, i blanked all details. - we currently have more than half of the 48 spots spoken for and continually receive calls to be placed on our waitlist from families who heard from someone we are opening a centre at said location. - our current i/t centres are so full, my wife stopped accepting applications, all new children are enrolled strictly by reference from current families or friends. she is taking waitlist for our small nw centre as we can contact them first when we open the new one. - in the last 5 years, we have not once had to advertise a spot for i/t and never had a vacancy. - for 3-5 it's less demand but we only run 1 small centre and it's only for current families wanting to continue with us and staff wanting to see the children grow up (we let staff rotate between centres). i hope my insights prove enlightening! **[edit]** wanted to add: 1) when signing up for a daycare, check their fraser health violations. this is public and you can check here: it was funded by our tax money so, it's.. uh really well designed. all daycares will have violations, but check what they are and that they were fixed promptly on follow up inspections. 2) ~~any daycare enrolled in ccfri has an agreement on how much they are allowed to charge. this is also publicly available and i will get you guys a website as soon as i get home.~~ i was wrong, not a thing as far as i can find.

maternity leave is a pittance in most cases. if this does not get addressed and more done to encourage and support families to have children, our future does not look too bright. fun facts: - we are not allowed to advertise or accept applicants before fraser health issues a license. - with the above consideration, i blanked all details. - we currently have more than half of the 48 spots spoken for and continually receive calls to be placed on our waitlist from families who heard from someone we are opening a centre at said location. - our current i/t centres are so full, my wife stopped accepting applications, all new children are enrolled strictly by reference from current families or friends. she is taking waitlist for our small nw centre as we can contact them first when we open the new one. - in the last 5 years, we have not once had to advertise a spot for i/t and never had a vacancy. - for 3-5 it's less demand but we only run 1 small centre and it's only for current families wanting to continue with us and staff wanting to see the children grow up (we let staff rotate between centres). i hope my insights prove enlightening! **[edit]** wanted to add: 1) when signing up for a daycare, check their fraser health violations. this is public and you can check here: it was funded by our tax money so, it's.. uh really well designed. all daycares will have violations, but check what they are and that they were fixed promptly on follow up inspections. 2) ~~any daycare enrolled in ccfri has an agreement on how much they are allowed to charge. this is also publicly available and i will get you guys a website as soon as i get home.~~ i was wrong, not a thing as far as i can find. [**edit**] was actually a blast talking to everyone. thank you for being nice, i was worried opening my inbox given the tone around this sub lately. glad to be proven absolutely wrong.",open daycar nw

anyone visiting vancouver or just new to the nightlife scene i thought i'd share from my experience. some of this might be obvious but i hope it's helpful- it's not impossible to have a good time in vancouver if you know what you're getting into. comment on what i'm missing! friday/saturday nights: 1. timing: arrive early (i.e. 10pm) to have a chance of getting in before the guestlist cutoff time (11pm) otherwise expect to pay $18-25 cover fee (plus $4 coat check). don't be surprised if the non-guestlist line moves faster-the club is restricting how many people they want to let in at the cheaper rate. 2. bring cash: if you don't, you'll be charged $5 for the atm and you'll only be able to take out $20 bills, which leaves you with change you'll probably end up throwing in the tip jar for convenience. 3. pre-game: otherwise you will be paying $10-12 per shot in the club. however, if you are too intoxicated at the door you may be refused entry, so you shouldn't be seen openly drinking in the line. 4. id: bring two pieces of id! bc is very strict about this and you will need to digitally scan your government id and have your photo taken before entering. 5. ratios: the more sleazy straight clubs (e.g. levels, bar none, granville strip) will be wanting to maintain an equal ratio of males to females and will let people bypass the line accordingly. go to those clubs with an equal-ratio group or be prepared to wait. 6. transit: most clubs close at 2am unless there is a special event. from 1am- 2:30am, it is extremely difficult and expensive to get an uber most friday/saturday nights especially if you're in a busier area. be prepared to walk+bus to get out of downtown and keep your phone charged for google maps. 7. vibes: vancouver doesn't go crazy. for the most part ""clubbing"" here is a bunch of people standing around in a hot room, pretending not to care while looking for someone to hit on. recommendation: fortune sound club on a monday or

in his mid-seventies in poor health. he has heart issues as well as some mobility issues (can walk, but has fallen and been unable to get up). he owns his own home on vancouver island in a smaller suburb, but it's in terrible shape as he is in no condition to keep the property in check (bordering on a hoarder situation, cobwebs everywhere, overgrown yard, etc.). the frontage is limited, but if you saw the back yard, you'd think the place was abandoned. i live on the mainland and am his only child relatively nearby. he is stubborn and suffers from mild agoraphobia and anxiety. but the thing i'm struggling the most to deal with is that he is not taking care of himself/his property. he is hugely avoidant (the mail piles up unopened for years). he's had his power shut off twice in the last year, leaving him scrambling to get it turned back on (he is a boomer and isn't great with technology to the point he couldn't figure out how to dial outside numbers on the cell phone he has). what scared me the most was last summer when his power went off the first time. he fell in his garage and smacked his head to the point that blood was everywhere. because he has cordless handsets, he couldn't use his landline to get help. he managed to finally prop himself up and crawl into his car and drove 45 minutes down the island highway to the nearest hospital. we only found out because i keep tabs on him and, when i couldn't find him, i called around to the nearby hospitals. this was utterly terrifying as he was in loads of danger with no way to reach out. and because i'm in the city, i have no way to get to him quickly/easily. getting his power turned back on (due to privacy restrictions with bc hydro) was a huge ordeal. i've offered to take on his utilities logins so i can keep on top of the payments and he insists that he will get autopay set up. he claims to have done this, but then his power got shut off again this morning and he managed to get ahold of me on his cell phone so i could merge in a call to bc hydro to get it set back up and turned on again. this has also happened with his internet and other utilities in the past. when my husband and i went to visit him for his birthday, i was horrified to discover that his auto insurance had expired three months earlier and he had been driving around uninsured. we marched him straight to icbc and got that fixed while we were there, but we can't count on him to be upfront about these things when we aren't (he only allows us to visit 1-2x per year). he owns his house outright, but has no income or significant savings. the house (a modest bungalow) is too much for him to manage and is costing him too much to heat/power/take care of. he forgot to fill out some important municipal forms/tax stuff and came \*thisclose\* to having the government selling his house out from underneath him. this isn't dementia or alzheimers - he just avoids a lot of these important tasks due to anxiety/depression. due to his health and (what i feel to be) the danger he poses to himself, i want to move him over to the mainland and get him into some sort of supportive housing for seniors. he doesn't need ltc (yet), but he needs an affordable option for seniors where he could maintain some independence, but also have me close enough by that i could get to him within an hour or two if something were to happen (and to keep on top of his living situation so it doesn't spiral out of control). the problem is that he thinks everything is fine and should keep on as it is. he shuts down any and every conversation that i try to broach with him about how his current way of living isn't working. which breaks my heart and has me swooping in to save him when these incidents happen. and i guess he's able-bodied enough that i can't force him to move. but even as-is, his house would need to be cleared out, repainted and fixed up before it could be sold. i want him to do that, live off the proceeds and rent for the rest of his life, but he claims he doesn't want to do that so he has something to leave me and my siblings (we are absolutely fine and do not need his money or assets). a house in a small suburb (of mainly retirees) on the island is obviously worth a fraction of vancouver prices, so he wouldn't be able to sell there and buy here. and rents here are out of control. he also doesn't really like vancouver (he has baggage), but i think i could get him set up in an older one-bedroom rental in white rock, squamish or maybe maple ridge? ultimately, i could really use some perspective and advice from anyone else who has experienced anything similar with elderly parents. i am woefully unfamiliar with the legal parameters as well as where to go and what to do. i'm sure that any affordable seniors housing has a significant waitlist, but i don't know where to start and googling has left me more confused than ever. and i don't want to take away his agency, but i also can't leave things as they are as he is apt to get hurt or worse. if anyone can offer up guidance or resources or even point me in the right direction of where to start looking, i'd be eternally grateful. i'm overwhelmed with my own life

to green light coal, oil and gas projects, while dismantling parts of the inflation reduction act…. i’m really shocked mgp would vote this way. —————— edited to add, as a lot of people seemed to think i’m an uninformed liberal without any nuance or knowledge of energy policy… ultimately, i believe her vote is inconsistent with her actual beliefs. i spoke with mgp directly at an event tonight about it. here’s my thoughts and how i respond to her (half hearted) support of this bill. tldr: most people in this thread are wrong and she seems to mainly care about the “permitting reform” aspect of this bill and her stated hope is that that part will survive the senate anyways. here are some more detailed thoughts: supporters of h.r. 1 contend that the bill aims to lower energy prices, but some very key provisions related to crude oil and methane gas (lng) exports will actually continue to raise energy costs for americans. the oil and gas industry has targeted the gulf south (texas and louisiana) to construct several new export terminal projects that would ramp up and lock in lng and crude oil exports for many decades. increased exports of domestic energy would restrict local supply and increase the price of fossil energy. americans cannot afford further energy price hikes, and h.r. 1’s provisions that promote the expansion of energy exports would do just that for gasoline, diesel, and monthly home gas bills. oil industry lobbyists contend that more lng exports will support our allies in europe, however, what they don’t mention is that 1) many european allies are working very hard to move away from fossil fuels entirely and 2) that most of the industry’s new construction proposals (which would be greenlit by h.r. 1) would not be built or operational for at least two or more years. thus, h.r. 1 would not help our allies. these new facilities will not be ready in time to significantly impact european energy supply. talking points promoting increased lng and oil exports are being pushed by industry lobbyists who want to lock in more profits by moving more american energy overseas. there are important ways that we can reduce energy costs for americans and i would love to see mgp support them. one senate bill, the big oil windfall profits tax ( targets the obscene profits that the oil and gas industry has raked in on the backs of hard working americans. another tool would be to impose restrictions on energy exports during price surges. many environmental and consumer advocates have been pushing for restrictions on exports to lower prices. here is a multi-part series that covers how texas lng exports contributed to the massive statewide blackout in february 2021 and subsequent energy price gouging that texas residents are still shouldering. mgp’s support on h.r. 1 is not wholehearted support – she mentioned to me that she doesn’t agree with many things in the bill, and that her primary intention behind voting for it would be to advance “permitting reform”, which she believes is needed to avoid negative impacts on clean energy projects. i understand the position and see how supporting this bill she doesn’t fully agree with is part of a reasonable political strategy to advance it to the senate chamber where the bad provisions can be stripped and passed back to the house. however, by making bold changes to permitting laws as this bill outlines, especially environmental regulation, we would likely deal with unintended consequences, like paving the way for truly destructive and detrimental polluting projects to disproportionately poor and working communities. in fact, the argument that permitting reform is a major obstacle to green energy projects is a little overblown. experts on this issue have found the antidote to our environmental permitting laws is fixing how they are administered, not getting rid of or weakening them ( the unintended negative consequences would far outweigh the benefits for moving green projects sooner. in some cases, laws like nepa are the only defense standing in the way of a massive polluting project or toxic pipeline that could devastate a local fishery or ecosystem. overall, i think h.r. 1 is not worth hanging her hat on and isn’t actually in line with her beliefs, but she may not be informed enough to even know that. even the permitting reform angle doesn’t pass the smell test and would strike mostly impoverished communities with more pollution. this bill has the oil and gas industry’s fingerprints all over it. i would strongly suggest she distance herself from it (and her concerned constituents let her know she should), especially its worst parts, and try to find better legislation to support to help americans through these tough times. lastly, this

to 'unleash' american energy  mgp voted to green light coal, oil and gas projects, while dismantling parts of the inflation reduction act…. i’m really shocked mgp would vote this way. —————— edited to add, as a lot of people seemed to think i’m an uninformed liberal without any nuance or knowledge of energy policy… ultimately, i believe her vote is inconsistent with her actual beliefs. i spoke with mgp directly at an event tonight about it. here’s my thoughts and how i respond to her (half hearted) support of this bill. tldr: most people in this thread are wrong and she seems to mainly care about the “permitting reform” aspect of this bill and her stated hope is that that part will survive the senate anyways. here are some more detailed thoughts: supporters of h.r. 1 contend that the bill aims to lower energy prices, but some very key provisions related to crude oil and methane gas (lng) exports will actually continue to raise energy costs for americans. the oil and gas industry has targeted the gulf south (texas and louisiana) to construct several new export terminal projects that would ramp up and lock in lng and crude oil exports for many decades. increased exports of domestic energy would restrict local supply and increase the price of fossil energy. americans cannot afford further energy price hikes, and h.r. 1’s provisions that promote the expansion of energy exports would do just that for gasoline, diesel, and monthly home gas bills. oil industry lobbyists contend that more lng exports will support our allies in europe, however, what they don’t mention is that 1) many european allies are working very hard to move away from fossil fuels entirely and 2) that most of the industry’s new construction proposals (which would be greenlit by h.r. 1) would not be built or operational for at least two or more years. thus, h.r. 1 would not help our allies. these new facilities will not be ready in time to significantly impact european energy supply. talking points promoting increased lng and oil exports are being pushed by industry lobbyists who want to lock in more profits by moving more american energy overseas. there are important ways that we can reduce energy costs for americans and i would love to see mgp support them. one senate bill, the big oil windfall profits tax ( targets the obscene profits that the oil and gas industry has raked in on the backs of hard working americans. another tool would be to impose restrictions on energy exports during price surges. many environmental and consumer advocates have been pushing for restrictions on exports to lower prices. here is a multi-part series that covers how texas lng exports contributed to the massive statewide blackout in february 2021 and subsequent energy price gouging that texas

[other possible places]( for us could be the cambie creek (no fires) and lone duck two group sites. from the bc parks website, cambie creek is not operating on those dates and lone duck two is already full. are there any other places to go? * **will we be able to sleep comfortably?** according to the [manning park resort snow forecast]( the weather is as follows. friday night: light snow, 2cm, low -6°c high -3°c, light winds saturday night: snow shwrs, low -4°c high -3°c, light winds checking on the [webcam]( of the skyview campground, there is snow on the ground. our setup and sleeping system is as follows. we will put a [camping tarp]( on the ground. our tent is the bugaboo mountain equipment olympus 2, it’s a large 2-people tent with a bottom tarp and a roof cover layer. we will put a [foam insulating pad]( under the mattress to give us some r-value and act as a sleeping pad. the mattress is the [intex dura-beam plus twin-size air mattress]( it’s not made for winter camping so it probably doesn’t contribute much to the r-value. we place a quilt on the mattress and cover the sides to prevent cold air from creeping up. our sleeping bags are the mummy-style eureka azalea (-9°c) and the eureka women’s casper (-9°c). we have another rectangular sleeping bag (-5°c) that we will use as a quilt, plus one small additional quilt. on the side of the bed, we will put a thick yoga mat to insulate the ground. i ordered a [tent-liner]( but it will not arrive in time. i tested the sleeping system at 3°c with no tarp, no foam pad, only the air mattress and -5°c rectangular sleeping bag and quilts, it was comfortable. is it better to always put back the tent and mattress in the car during the day or is it possible to leave the set-up in place? will our system be warm enough for sleeping comfortably, and the tent protect us against the wind? * **after the hiking, what is the optimal way to warm up?** after the snowshoeing hike, probably we will be wet from exercise. in order to warm up quickly, probably we would change to dry clothes, jump in the car and use heating. we can go to the shelter on the campground, or make a fire. we can even drive to the downhill ski resort. would it be a good idea to get something like a heated blanket that plugs in the car? or any other tricks to warm up quickly and be comfortable at camp? * **what should we do with our damp clothing, gear and footwear? will it be able to dry?** probably, our base layers as well as jackets, snow pants, and footwear will be wet possibly soaked. my wife suggested that we bring at least 1 set of base layers for each day. i can also bring two pairs of boots. i am wondering if people have a good way of drying gear, especially for longer trips. my layers are mostly quick-dry polyester. what are the best way to dry clothes and footwear? * **where to hike?** my wife enjoys spectacular views, and i enjoy long hikes. we have some experience in winter hiking and snowshoeing and we are intermediate level. we probably will do 1-2 short day hikes and 1-2 long day hikes, if everything goes well we would stay for 3-4 days, 3 nights. i was thinking to bring our downhill skiing equipment in case the weather is not so great we can substitute a snowshoeing hike for skiing. for the short hikes, i’m mostly interested in the [lightning lake loop]( ) (8.5km, 206m) that could be extended to the [flash]( or [strike]( lakes; the [memaloose peak]( (13.8km, 811m); and the [grassy, bojo, mara loop]( (14.5km, 873m) but we would probably skip mara. for the long hikes, i’m interested in [windy joe mountain]( (15.4km, 1105m), and [frosty mountain west summit]( (14.3, 1280m), or maybe [snow camp]( (17.1km, 911m). some other options that i saw on alltrails are [mt kelly]( (7.4km, 570m), [burnt knoll]( (14.5km, 690m), [fat dog]( (14.8km, 697m), [frosty mountain east summit]( (21.2km, 1220). * **what would be a good backup plan?** when we arrive, if we see that the camping site seems too cold, we will just do one day hike and drive back home. if we are not comfortable sleeping there, we can go to another location within southwestern bc and spend the remaining of the time there. as a backup plan, we could go to [mamquam river campground]( in squamish for camping, and do the snowshoeing in the whistler area. * **references where i found the information** thank you so much for your help!",vancouverhiking,need advice for snowshoeing and camping trip to e.c. manning park,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverhiking/comments/12axm6h/need_advice_for_snowshoeing_and_camping_trip_to/,"need advice for snowshoeing and camping trip to e.c. manning park my wife and i are planning a trip to do snowshoeing and tent camping during the easter holiday weekend (april 7-10). we were thinking of going to the [e.c. manning park]( what are your advice, suggestion and experience?

risks, but oftentimes safety takes a backseat. if nobody else seems to care, it's essential to remember that you bear the responsibility when you work these jobs. also, it's worth noting that in some situations, it may be cheaper for everyone to deal with your ""loss of life on the job"" over a carrier ending injury. consider this a warning: our country is facing similar issues to america in terms

go to put out spot fires. they brought food and supplies to the firehall and were in turn fed and watered. they were an integral part of saving the town. i watched this unfold with my own eyes. so many people acting courageously when the time came. hundreds of people willing to risk their lives to protect their town, yet the volunteer fire departments total manpower is less than 20. it makes my blood absolutely boil. if even half of those 100 people had stepped up and received training they could have been infinitely more useful in slowing the fires. the #1 problem they had was manpower. they had hundreds of people available willing to fight but all that manpower is useless without the communication and organization that is needed to actually properly fight the fires. i have the utmost respect for each one of those citizens and i beg beg beg anyone who feels that they have the strength and courage to defy an evacuation order to protect their town to join the fucking agencies that are dedicated to do that exact thing. if they had 100 volunteer firefighters with 100 radios they could justify the expense of 100 sets of gear, more trucks, more equipment. instead we had locals fighting fires in the middle of the bush when houses were burning. we had air assets available to deploy but they couldnt because locals were in the middle of the forest fighting fires. i'm not even going into the thefts because desperate people saving their homes do desperate things. its despicable, but i can at least emphasize with it. what absolutely enraged me was finding a group of locals 10km from town fighting a fire using obviously stolen equipment in an area where no structures were at risk. they were there because if they were closer to town they would have been caught with stolen gear. they got to play fireman deep in the bush believing they were helping the community all the while preventing air assets from being used, using equipment that could have been used to protect structures. this is the truth that needs to be shared. the rcmp overstepped their grounds but they did so because the theft is so rampant. thieves stole the fucking pumps from the scotch creek bridge for gods sakes. i implore anyone who has the courage to defy an evacuation order, join your local fire department. they will give you training! provide you with the organization to effectively deploy large amounts of manpower. you will get to stay and protect your community through evacuation orders. you will be allowed to move freely through town. its so easy. its so much easier than the alternative...hiding and skirting law enforcement without coordination and communication. fuck so much devastation, so much loss. so much manpower waisted i just cant take it. 5 days of 18 hour days working with people who lost their homes yet they still show up every day and will continue despite their fellow community members efforts to undermine their work. it's been a long time since i've

to fires, and smoke in the kootenays since there also are wildfires. does anyone know how the situation is there? we'd like to visit cranbrook, nelson, ainsworth kasko and nakusp. option 2: cancel the

post: [ a huge thank you to everyone who responded to my original post about our trip to the area in june - this community is great. we have made some changes to our travel route and wanted to share. we have had the flights and accommodations booked for some time but were able to make a few adjustments to the accommodations without an increase in cost. we also made sure that all ferry reservations were booked for the morning routes just in case there were issues and a later one was needed. we have not made any specific bookings for activities yet. instead we have made a list of possibilities for each day or area and, other than a few that will require booked appointments, are leaving it up to whatever we are up for on that particular day. we have no problem adding or dropping any ideas and honestly just doing this route and finding stuff on the way would be just as well. that being said, i would very much appreciate your help with additional suggestions of possible things to do or your thoughts/reviews on anything already listed that you think just aren't worth it. i have started making a list of already suggested food spots but would love to hear more of your favorite places as well (especially your go to asian food places and must have items). i know we are trying to get a lot in and could easily spend 1-2 weeks in many of these individual areas but are trying to make the most of our 2 weeks. thank you in advance for taking the time to read and provide your thoughts - you all have been awesome!!! &#x200b; *a little background on my family: i am originally from calgary and spent many years in southern alberta but have never been to vancouver or the surrounding area and we have been wanting to go for many years. i currently work and live down in the states in colorado. my family very much enjoys hiking and outdoor activities but we do not take many vacations. we all love museums, aquariums and anything to do with native culture as well as just enjoying and experiencing this beautiful world we live in. i have taken my girls back to southern alberta several times (i have to keep stocking up on my canadian goods) and then they have been to california a few times. we are finally in a position to take a trip and this is what we chose to experience together.* &#x200b; **---day 1 saturday** arrive sea-tac airport 9am, pick up rental and travel to vancouver

island/victoria, seattle original post: [ a huge thank you to everyone who responded to my original post about our trip to the area in june - this community is great. we have made some changes to our travel route and wanted to share. we have had the flights and accommodations booked for some time but were able to make a few adjustments to the accommodations without an increase in cost. we also made sure that all ferry reservations were booked for the morning routes just in case there were issues and a later one was needed. we have not made any specific bookings for activities yet. instead we have made a list of possibilities for each day or area and, other than a few that will require booked appointments, are leaving it up to whatever we are up for on that particular day. we have no problem adding or dropping any ideas and honestly just doing this route and finding stuff on the way would be just as well. that being said, i would very much appreciate your help with additional suggestions of possible things to do or your thoughts/reviews on anything already listed that you think just aren't worth it. i have started making a list of already suggested food spots but would love to hear more of your favorite places as well (especially your go to asian food places and must have items). i know we are trying to get a lot in and could easily spend 1-2 weeks in many of these individual areas but are trying to make the most of our 2 weeks. thank you in advance for taking the time to read and provide your thoughts - you all have been awesome!!! &#x200b; *a little background on my family: i am originally from calgary and spent many years in southern alberta but have never been to vancouver or the surrounding area and we have been wanting to go for many years. i currently work and live down in the states in colorado. my family very much enjoys hiking and outdoor activities but we do not take many vacations. we all love museums, aquariums and anything to do with native culture as well as just enjoying and experiencing this beautiful world we live in. i have taken my girls back to southern alberta several times (i have to keep stocking up on my canadian goods) and then they have been to california a few times. we are finally in a position to take a trip and this is what we chose to experience together.* &#x200b; **---day 1 saturday** arrive sea-tac airport 9am,

just got back home from my class 5 test and passed! the examiner didn't ask me anything in regards to a ticket so i kept my mouth shut. just as drivertesterguy said (and [this website]( as long as you haven't racked up enough demerit points to warrant a driving prohibition, you should be fine. i'm going to pay off the ticket in a few days after i receive my paycheque to have this whole ordeal over and done w as i don't think i have much of a foot to stand on and so why drag out the time and community resources? i will just treat this as a big lesson to be more vigilant of regulatory signs. will update if it turns out my licence does get revoked after i pay the ticket (i don't think it'll happen though). but yea, this is just a cautionary tale for all the new drivers out there. stay safe

act (the act) was passed on may 11, 2023, imposing limitations on employers in the hiring process, as well as obligations to report pay. the act also creates the role of director of pay transparency. the key obligations are as follows: pay history: employers must not ask job applicants their previous pay rate; job postings: employers must include the expected pay or pay range for publicly posted jobs from november 1, 2023, onwards; pay secrecy: employers must not discipline or otherwise harass an employee who asks about their pay, reveals their pay to another employee or someone applying to work with their employer; asks their employer about its pay transparency report, or gives information to the director of pay transparency about their employer; and pay transparency report: applicable employers must complete and post pay transparency reports, which will be published annually on june 1 by the ministry of finance. applicable employers currently include the government and specified crown corporations; however, starting november 1, 2024, all employers with 1,000 or more employees will be required to comply. by 2027, all employers in bc will be required to complete and post pay transparency reports unless exempted by regulation. british columbia trails the path of most other provinces in imposing pay transparency obligations, many of which also have pay equity obligations requiring employers to not only disclose pay, but ensure that pay is equitable amongst similarly positioned employees. alberta and saskatchewan are the only provinces without any such legislation. so what does this really mean for employers in british columbia? the act does not currently set out penalties for noncompliant employers or oblige employers to disclose any inequities in pay. it also does not designate a particular body, such as the employment standards branch, to investigate or discipline employers, so it is unclear what enforcement of the act may look like. currently, there are no enforcement mechanisms in the act. despite the lack of enforcement provisions under the act, there are existing pay equity protections for employees under section 12 of the human rights code, which prohibits employers from discriminating in wages between similarly positioned employees on the basis of sex. this places the onus on employees to initiate a complaints process with the bc human rights tribunal in order to address concerns with respect to wage discrimination. employers should comply with the new obligations under the act and anticipate that noncompliance in pay inequities can be enforced under the human rights regime. employers should take steps to confirm that they are compliant with pay transparency and pay equity requirements, along with best practices, as we anticipate

west kelowna and struggling to find an air purifier or just cant afford one, there is an easy diy solution. if you have a window ac unit, floor (portable, with tubes) ac unit, or even an old box fan, all you need is a furnace filter. i used one of these: [ this is similar to the corsi-rosenthal box concept created during the covid 19 pandemic, however it only uses one filter instead of 4 and uses equipment that many people already have. i don't know many people who have box fans, but i know countless people with portable/window ac units. the boxes are undoubtedly better, but this still works and is much cheaper and easier to make. simply pick a filter that fits your ac's interior air intake closely in one dimension, and then cut it to size in the other dimension. in this case a 16 inch wide filter fit my unit perfectly, i just had to cut it in half to fit the vertical dimension. then, making sure you align the airflow direction arrow correctly (these are directional filters) tape it to the unit with whatever you have. i used some aluminium tape because i wanted to do a fairly neat job, but you can use duct tape, electrical tape, or anything else that will hold it on. the suction will pull the filter against the unit, you just want to seal off as many gaps as possible so that most of the air goes through the filter. you can usually get two uses out of a single filter, so it's cost effective, with the filters usually costing $20-$30 each. i usually have to replace them during smoke season once per month, your mileage may vary depending on your ac. mine is a 12,000 btu toshiba unit from 2019, and does an excellent job of moving lots of air, and in my experience has beat out a $250 danby purifier with one of these filters. you can also do this with an industrial box fan that can be purchased for cheap at most hardware stores and are normally not in super high demand as they are large and can be loud, so find one that is bearable for you and accept the tradeoff of a bit more noise for cleaner air. you can always run it during the day when you are away from home and turn it off when you get back, it'll still filter a lot of air in that time. keep in mind if your ac has an especially weak fan, this may not work super well, and may trip the machine's circuit protection, causing it to pulse the fan. i've had this happen with another machine, and the solution was to leave a gap at the edges, after which it worked fine and still managed to turn the filter entirely dark brown after the fire season in 2021 so it did obviously still did something. stay safe out

understand how someone in our community would go out of their way to kill a tree like this, to drill 25 holes in it and fill them with herbicide,” says infrastructure general manager mac logan. “the city will have to recover the cost to eventually remove the tree replace it, but the idea that someone would actively choose to harm their community in this way bothers me greatly. it’s now happened for a third time in less than a year and we as a community need to stop such acts.” tragically, the poisoned tree will perish over the next two to three months and city staff will seek to preserve the tree in an effort to continue to support local wildlife until it is deemed a safety hazard and needs to be removed. previous acts of intentional vandalism targeted urban trees on manhattan drive and in the clarence greenspace area. the vandalism at clarence greenspace last summer led to the harm of more than just the initial target. due to a connected root system, six other aspen trees died as a result. in addition to the targeted poisonings, on earth day this year, the kelowna fire department responded to a fire burning in the root system of a mature tree in kelowna’s waterfront park on cedar avenue, and while extinguished, the tree was significantly damaged and had to be removed. investigations to identify individuals responsible for this latest case of vandalism are underway and we

after having a conversation with a beautiful individual at salmon trail on friday, i must admit i was deeply disturbed. i was informed that an individual whom was afraid of dogs has attempted to limit and restrict further more the space available for dogs to run free, play, and socialize. more concerning was the fact that there are already stakes placed within the ground to go ahead with this plan. firstly, perhaps who ever has final “say” in this manner should educate them self on precisely who predominantly utilizes this public space and the benefits the salmon trail brings to our entire community. as an individual who has walked this trail for many years and spent an enormous amount of time down there, some very specific issues need to be put on the table: in the last decade of my utilization of these walking paths i have never encountered a dog that was aggressive, dangerous, nor a threat. i have encountered dozens of extremely happy, social, loving dogs whom have done nothing but brighten my day. salmon trail is the only location in lumby where dog owners may take their dog to get the exercise that a healthy dog requires for their mental, emotional, and physical well-being. as lumby is obviously a small community salmon trail is a pivotal center point for the community to get out, clear their mind, get fresh air, tune into nature, relieve stress, create friendships, create time for laughter, smiles, and a space for wide open hearts. this is critical to the mental, emotional, and physical health and well-being of the entire community. dogs are an intrinsic part of a healthy community as they actually assist their guardians with healing, holding their pain, being present when no one nor no thing can seemingly help a person, relieving depression and anxiety, getting a person outside in nature, providing a person with something to love and the deeply needed feeling of being loved. dogs are a beautiful “family member” to care for, learn from, and make us better within ourselves. the dogs at salmon trail provide children and seniors whom are not able to have pets of their own the opportunity to still interact with animals in a safe fun space. filling their hearts with joy and the unconditional love that exudes from the dogs themselves. to think that one or a few would have an intention to stifle and cripple the healthiest location for socializing in the lumby community based on individual fear, unwillingness to think of anyone but them-self, as well as personal negation of their own issues is beyond ridiculous. further more the fact that this is taking priority over the actual health and well-being of this community is astounding to me. in order to be a healthy community we need to be surrounded in a healthy environment, with healthy people and healthy animals. this is what salmon trail provides to all of the dog owners and local families, those whom are the actual predominant ones utilizing these trails. if a fencing investment is going to be funded than perhaps it should simply be used to put up a wire mesh fence on the inside of the fencing that already exists within the dog area. if there is going to be any changes made to the freedoms of the dogs may i suggest that the entire trail be off leash for this is the only location where the dogs are safe to really run, let off steam, refuel their energy tanks for their owners, and have an opportunity to be in a more natural environment allowing them to socialize the way they are naturally meant to. this is what creates a safe and healthy dog, giving sustenance to a safe and healthy community. closing on a positive note, i would like to give thanks and gratitude for all those whom came together to make salmon trail what it is today. the heart and soul of each individual who came together to create and put up the facilities provided have done an excellent job. thank you. it is no secret that dogs are significant in facilitating healthy humans.

for permission to attach our names to our experience... and it gives the accused/offender a chance to present arguments why we should remain under a court imposed ban. what do we want? very simply... 1. stop prosecuting victim-complainants if they breach the ban. 2. simplify the process for removing the ban at any time during the court process and make sure that the opinion of the offender or accused is not a factor. 3. request consent from the victim-complainant before applying a s486.4 ban to their name. 4. provide clear and multi-lingual information about 486.4 publication bans on

story on the canadian true crime podcast ( in a two part series about what can happen when publication bans backfire... essentially, what happens when a shield turns into a sword. it touches on the impact the unknown and unwanted publication ban had on me and how it jeopardized the safety of others in victoria. the details are graphic - all information in the podcast are from my court transcripts and court related documents. it is undisputed fact and gives the full story about what happened to me in september 2015. there were parts of the trial i never heard, such as his full defense or how the defence painted my character. it also goes through the journey i had to remove the ban. in mid-march, our petition closed and things really started to take off. we were finally

party support. it is going to be a very, very busy week for us. as with most other victim-turned-advicates, we are doing this work in our spare time and our travel is self funded. if you are able to help us with getting to ottawa so we can help get our campaign to get s.486.4 of the criminal code amended, please visit for more info or visit to donate to us.there are 8 of us going from all over canada to watch our work come to light. i can't begin to tell you how emotional this trip will be. we have done everything asked of us after being assaulted. we reported to police. we took part in our trials. we have been vocal advocates in our communities fighting for change and a result of how we were treated in this legal system and have several recommendations to make sure this never happens

news on the housing front. just today, city council reviewed the [staff report]( and recommendations to “fix” the missing middle housing initiative, which was triggered by the scheduled six month review. that review found that the policy was too restrictive and resulted in next to no new housing qualifying under the missing middle bylaw. staff recommended a number of improvements and suggestions which council supported. but wait, there’s more! jeremy caradonna proposed several amendments which were roughly: - delegate parking variances for missing middle houses to staff (goal is to allow car-light/free missing middle housing) - reduce front yard setbacks for plexes from 6.1m to 4.0m (goal is to make it possible to build missing middle housing on more sizes of lots and to prioritize backyard/shared spaces that are useful over lawns in the front that nobody uses) - increase the maximum height allowed and require that the basement suites have a finished ceiling that is at least 1.1m above average grade (goal is to ensure basement suites are livable) and marianne alto proposed an additional amendment - increase the maximum allowable site coverage of corner townhomes

enough to allow at least some houses and we won't get another report that says essentially none qualified. but that’s just my gut feeling, i really don’t know. and to be clear, this policy is not

from 10 months ago, where colwood council unanimously rejected a 142-unit apartment building.]( and it’s been bugging me, so i decided to write a giant wall of text and share that with all of you. specifically what stood out to me in this article was what one of colwood’s councilors, cynthia day, said about the decision to reject the apartment: > “i would love to support a project like this that has less blasting and more land preserved, but i’m in a hard spot **because this plan is not sitting well with our community. it’s not my job to convince the public to accept this plan, that’s your job,”** coun. cynthia day said. if colwood council was basing their decision on who showed up to their public hearing, then they were very likely biased to favor nimby viewpoints over those of the general public. how many people in colwood do you think cynthia heard from? how many of you reading this show up to public hearings? the problem is it’s mostly people who don't like developments near them who show up to hearings, and **every** infill development has at least some people who don't like it. so it’s problematic when councilors see the feedback from those people as representing the general public. the canada-british columbia expert panel on the future of housing supply and affordability report ""[opening doors: unlocking housing supply for affordability]( (published in 2021 in response to our housing crisis) identified this as a problem, saying: > “an important aspect of governance is the land-use planning process, which offers citizens opportunities to provide input on new development based on both real and perceived impacts. we believe that democratic processes are important, but that **overreliance on public hearings to make land-use decisions tends to favor certain voices over others.** this can result in perceptions of majority opposition to new development, **especially when the citizens most motivated and available to participate in the process generally oppose the development plans.**” > “this opposition puts political pressure on the elected officials in charge of reviewing the proposals. **its influence strengthens further as those who support or stand to benefit from new housing supply often do not attend public hearings to voice their views and priorities.** such proceedings contribute to a land-use planning system that prevents new housing supply in two ways: first, by restricting or impeding growth as a consequence of lengthy, uncertain and costly processes; and second, by **allowing anti-development interests to apply disproportionate political pressure on decision makers.**” the report also said, in the section titled “nimbyism”, that: > … there are invariably vocal groups of residents—particularly neighbourhood associations—that can make it politically difficult for local governments to implement such changes. it is important to note that opponents to development, including but not limited to neighbourhood associations, may not be representative of the broader population. for instance, research has found that in vancouver and toronto, members of neighbour associations are more likely to be white, older, more educated, homeowners, who have lived in their homes for longer and hold different policy priorities than the general population. **to make inroads toward fairer, more representative discussions on land use and the way our neighbourhoods evolve, it is therefore important to make sure that all voices and interests are able to shape how our cities grow.** councilors are supposed to lead, not just do whatever a small group of people who happen to show up to a particular hearing tell them to do. so, yes, **it is your job to convince the public and to lead,** cynthia! this is just one example of what’s happening in basically every city. i also remember not too long ago [saanich council voted to send an apartment building to an (optional) public hearing ]( at that meeting, “council was swayed monday night by the concerns of neighbours, who said the building proposed by abstract developments would be too large and out of character for the neighbourhood.” saanich councilor colin
