How disgraceful. We are currently sheltering evacuees, places like Alexis Creek, 100 Mile House, Soda Creek, all in dire straights, people with homes lost, even reports of an entire trailer park being burnt away. There's people camping up at the Maple Park Mall parking lot, with whatever they could bring from their home, Prince George have multiple Evacuee shelters READY to go. And here's the BBD Society wanting to go ahead with the festival? Some people don't even know IF they have homes to return to, and you think they want a beer gardens and dumb carnival? You think they want to buy an 80$ hoodie from a vendor downtown? I feel really upset, and disgraced to be a part of Quesnel right now. What the Society SHOULD do is donate what revenue they have budgeted for BBD and with the city's and businesses that support them, decide to donate proceeds to people, and places that need help. It was reported that firefighters will be out there day after day, constantly until possibly even mid to late August. People putting their lives on the line, people volunteering, and people trying to stem the damage of actual, out-of-control fires. Fires that in some places are LARGER than 4200 hectares. Just because the fire isn't giving us an evacuation order, doesn't mean we should celebrate. Myself and others I have talked to in person are disgusted and ashamed to be a part of Quesnel right now. Shame on you.

Edit: A friend had expressed similar displeasure, and called the society to voice their concern. They were informed that due to the number concerned calls they received, they held a second meeting Monday evening, and decided to cancel the BBD event, due to recent circumstances. Thank you to anyone who raised their voice to this, and thank you to the BBD Society for listening to the community.",Quesnel,"Billy Barker Days Society, Really?",0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quesnel/comments/6mii3b/billy_barker_days_society_really/
