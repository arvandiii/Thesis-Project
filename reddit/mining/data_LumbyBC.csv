Many of you that live along the creek are familiar with the evacuation alerts. This is your notification to prepare your to go bags and be ready to leave the area on short notice..

An evacuation order will usually be hand delivered to your door advising you that you have to leave the area immediately due to imminent danger. Here in Lumby, due to high flood waters, we have had to evacuate homes along the creek a few times. I am hopeful we will not be using any of this over the summer months.

A rescind order is when the danger has lifted and you are able to return to your property and work towards getting back to a normal life after a bit of excitement! 

There is lots of valuable information on the Prepared BC website to assist you in preparing yourself and your family. With the smoke in the air the last 2 days it just seemed timely to put something out.

After having a conversation with a beautiful individual at Salmon Trail on Friday, I must admit I was deeply disturbed. I was informed that an individual whom was afraid of dogs has attempted to limit and restrict further more the space available for dogs to run free, play, and socialize. More concerning was the fact that there are already stakes placed within the ground to go ahead with this plan.

Firstly, perhaps who ever has final “say” in this manner should educate them self on precisely who predominantly utilizes this public space and the benefits the Salmon Trail brings to our entire community.

As an individual who has walked this trail for many years and spent an enormous amount of time down there, some very specific issues need to be put on the table:

In the last decade of my utilization of these walking paths I have never encountered a dog that was aggressive, dangerous, nor a threat. I have encountered dozens of extremely happy, social, loving dogs whom have done nothing but brighten my day.
Salmon Trail is the only location in Lumby where dog owners may take their dog to get the exercise that a healthy dog requires for their mental, emotional, and physical well-being.
As Lumby is obviously a small community Salmon Trail is a pivotal center point for the community to get out, clear their mind, get fresh air, tune into nature, relieve stress, create friendships, create time for laughter, smiles, and a space for  wide open hearts. This is critical to the mental, emotional, and physical health and well-being of the entire community.
Dogs are an intrinsic part of a healthy community as they actually assist their guardians with healing, holding their pain, being present when no one nor no thing can seemingly help a person, relieving depression and anxiety, getting a person outside in nature, providing a person with something to love and the deeply needed feeling of being loved. Dogs are a beautiful “family member” to care for, learn from, and make us better within ourselves.
The dogs at Salmon Trail provide children and seniors whom are not able to have pets of their own the opportunity to still interact with animals in a safe fun space. Filling their hearts with joy and the unconditional love that exudes from the dogs themselves.
To think that one or a few would have an intention to stifle and cripple the healthiest location for socializing in the Lumby community based on individual fear, unwillingness to think of anyone but them-self, as well as personal negation of their own issues is beyond ridiculous. Further more the fact that this is taking priority over the actual health and well-being of this community is astounding to me.
In order to be a healthy community we need to be surrounded in a healthy environment, with healthy people and healthy animals. This is what Salmon Trail provides to all of the dog owners and local families, those whom are the actual predominant ones utilizing these trails.
If a fencing investment is going to be funded than perhaps it should simply be used to put up a wire mesh fence on the inside of the fencing that already exists within the dog area.
If there is going to be any changes made to the freedoms of the dogs may I suggest that the entire trail be off leash for this is the only location where the dogs are safe to really run, let off steam, refuel their energy tanks for their owners, and have an opportunity to be in a more natural environment allowing them to socialize the way they are naturally meant to. This is what creates a safe and healthy dog, giving sustenance to a safe and healthy community.
Closing on a positive note, I would like to give thanks and gratitude for all those whom came together to make Salmon Trail what it is today. The Heart and Soul of each individual who came together to create and put up the facilities provided have done an excellent job. Thank you.

It is no secret that dogs are significant in facilitating healthy humans. The relationship that we create with nature and all of her animals is paramount to a healthy community.
