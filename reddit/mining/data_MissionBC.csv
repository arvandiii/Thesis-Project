I grew up in Mission BC during the late 90's and my mom used to always take my sister and I to Save on Foods (I am 99% sure it was save on foods) it used to be right beside where the silvercity cinema is now (where staples is currently).

I recall it had a huge metal pot out front which was a waterfall with a pool beneath that people threw coins into. There was also a big knife and fork as well.

Anyway, I also remember inside there was a bunch of animatronic vegetables, animals, and even a cloud that used a smoke machine to blow at you. You could activate them by swiping your membership card.

I have such fond memories of that and I was wondering if anyone else remembers or maybe has photos of them? Idk just a weird nostalgia thing but I started thinking about them out of the blue the other day.",MissionBC,Animatronic Vegetables,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/MissionBC/comments/14snnn4/animatronic_vegetables/
