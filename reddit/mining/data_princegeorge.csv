Should she stay or should she go?

At a minimum, she could stay as a trustee but needs to step down as chair. It seems a pretty obvious conflict of interest to vote on a motion that would directly involve one's conduct, but she did anyway.

Trustees Craig Brennan and Cory Antrim need to step up and explain why they  voted against that display of accountability.

I'm curious what other PG'ers think about this? 

I'm not discounting what happened (even more so considering the injuries) but it creates two MAJOR ISSUES moving forward

* What about the businesses who face additional financial hardships due to the ongoing problems downtown? 
   * My business has spent around $30,000 in the last few years to reduce frequency and severity of issues 
   * There has been a **SIGNIFICANT** increase in issues since the closure of the 1st Avenue encampment
* What happens when something like this happens again? What if there is an alleyway fire which ignites multiple buildings?
   * This act sets a dangerous precedent moving forward

I get the intent behind this and I'm sure the City Council members who voted in favor of this do have their hearts in the right places however I do think the ""good will"" will be negated from the repercussions.

As the title suggests, a novice driver here. Two questions:

Block heater

I read somewhere that you should start to use the block heater (for the benefit of the car engine) when the temperature is -15 C and below. My question is: would this number refer to the max temperature or the lowest temperature of the day? A concrete example: temperature for tomorrow is projected to be -11 to -17C. Should I use the block heater tonight, if I intend to drive tomorrow morning? The concern is not necessarily whether the car can start, but rather to avoid stressing the engine. 

[Added question about the block heater] I just read that if I close the hood when using the block heater, it may damage the cord of the block heater, leading to fire and damage ([source](https://www.fordservicecontent.com/Ford_Content/vdirsnet/OwnerManual/Home/Content?variantid=6214&languageCode=en&countryCode=USA&Uid=G2078447&ProcUid=G2078448&userMarket=USA&div=l&vFilteringEnabled=False&buildtype=web)):

> WARNING:  Do not fully close the hood, or allow it to drop under its own weight when using the engine block heater. This could damage the power cable and may cause an electrical short resulting in fire, injury and property damage.

What does it mean then? I need to leave the hood unlocked overnight, which means anyone can come and open it? Also, if it snows/rains and it is windy, wouldn't that allow water to get to the engine parts of the car, if the hood is not fully closed? 

Car wash 

I had been using a touchless car wash before the snow season, as I don't have a proper driveway. Can I still use it in the winter months? It feels a little counter-intuitive because I feel that the water will freeze on the car upon contact when it gets really cold. Or, am I just being irrational?

I went out and revisited this trail this week; saw a little black bear just before the parking lot, 2 moose, 1 deer, and two types of toads.

There is a picnic table, an outhouse, and a fire ring ([Current Fire Ban Status](http://bcfireinfo.for.gov.bc.ca/hprScripts/WildfireNews/Bans.asp)) at the parking lot.  Good trail, boarded walkway for wet areas, an little bit steep at the very end when accessing the river.  I didn't time it and took some diversions, but maybe plan 3-4 hours.

Take a picnic, enjoy the riverside : )  Lots of flat areas and sand to sit on.

*Went again on May 21, the river is much higher.  Saw no animals : (, but it was a good hike.  Searched for the old homestead which I think is to the South of the river access.  There is an old road that cuts off the trail, but it is quite overgrown and easy to lose; the river game trail was much easier to traverse, and watch out for what I presume is a* [bear den](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalTracking/comments/brjerq/bear_den/) *(Right on the game trail.).*   

*After searching on google maps, I can not see any evidence of an old homestead on the West side of the river; thought I wonder about the old road.*

im going to be taking co-guardianship of my sister(16f) and have her move in with me so is there anything i need to do differently than if i was just moving in by myself? she also smokes so im wondering if ""no smoking"" rules in rental ads means just no smoking inside or no smoking in the general area? is there any specific type of job in pg that would be easier for someones first time employment?

whenever i get money its through selling clothes and stuff i dont wear/need on fb marketplace. i like to volunteer so im also wondering if theres any local volunteer work that i could get a bit of extra food from so i dont have to spend as much money on food? idk im super lost and ive been watching a lot of videos on this stuff but it hasnt been as helpful as i thought it would.

After the restrictions were lifted I attempted to check out some of the so called trendy places in this fine city. Now I'm not going to mention any real details about these places because it could just be me. But I went in and immediately felt awkward and very much an outsider. This has happened more than once, I dunno maybe I'm not just hip enough lol.
 Anyways being lonely and bored, I against better judgement signed up for Plenty of Fish. I don't do Tinder because that's not what I'm looking for. POF has been interesting to say the least, in fact it was very overwhelming like I was the only girl on there. Not to insult this city but there was a lot of creeps on there and a few that really bothered me. It wasn't all bad and I met a few guys really nice to talk to. Well one of the creeps reported me as being fake and I lost contact with the good ones. Needless to say that I gave up on that.
So I guess the point to all of this that I'm curious if there is some other ways online to meet people here? I am planning on starting work in the next two months so I'm sure I'll meet more people there but it's really frustrating. Maybe someone can enlighten me on these trendy places, maybe i went on a bad day who knows.

I have not worked in my chosen field in nearly a year because of everything. I also have a young child that I was looking forward to having visit his other friends (we just finished a quarantine as a household member was overseas) that we have been safely visiting throughout the past 9 months. I can't attend any of the very regulated events my friends have worked to put together because they are 'events'. Sadness all around, and a bit of anger. 

But the folks who are calling for Network (the movie) like responses and decrying the small business losses, when surely many of them have been happy to shop at Costco and Wal-Mart nearly exclusively for years.. It's a bit much. A lot of local businesses (from what I've seen) have pivoted to online/curbside pickup pretty successfully. Craft fairs are a sad loss, but honestly, a good percentage of what I've seen at them in recent years are folks with a cricut machine who think they're artists and MLM shills. A lot of the serious artisans/crafters have webpages/are posting on Facebook marketplace etc and I'm hoping they are being sought out. 

Anyway, this is a 3am post (nothing good ever happens at 3am!) but I'm just so frustrated by small minded jerks that have a platform via social media that I keep running into. I do agree that the PHO needs to make sense: why are movie theatres and some gyms open, but very regulated theatre events are not permitted? Safe home visits to loved ones? Make it make sense! The mask mandate is long overdue and it feels like a whole bunch was tacked on to make that stick.

I've mostly done this on the new reddit theme, but I updated the sidebar in the old reddit so links to pretty much all of this can be found, as well.

Here's what's new:

I left the old thumbnail in the old reddit ([old.reddit.com/r/princegeorge](https://old.reddit.com/r/princegeorge)) but for the new reddit I've got an update photo of Mr. PG as the thumb and a shot of downtown Prince George as the banner. It hopefully looks something like this.

# Sticky post/Moving to Prince George Megathread:

I looked at some other city subreddits and it seems like Wikis get old fast. So I decided to make a [Moving to Prince George megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/e4ck0e/the_moving_tovisitingwondering_aboutbest_of/) with the idea that people can add their own advice in the comments. If it gets terribly out of date, I'll just make a new one at some point in the future, or edit this one. Please contribute in the comments!

# Post Flair/Categories

I also looked at other city subreddits to see how they filter their posts and came up with a system that lets you choose either a category or community for your post to be filtered into. They are as follows:

**Type**

These seem to be the most common sort of posts we've had so far, so it's what I made. The one problem is that some posts fit into multiple categories and there doesn't seem to be a way to illustrate that. Open to feedback.

# User flair

You can now choose user flair. I put in a ton of neighbourhoods but idk maybe you want to do animals or rivers or something. Let me know.

# Going forward

I'm hoping this is a good template to help the subreddit grow. I encourage you to post news, photos, thoughts, etc to make it a bit more active than it has been-- and please follow the fairly simple rules!

**1. Be kind.**

This is a small subreddit, so we want to be friendly and welcoming. As a rule of thumb: if you wouldn't say it to someone's face, don't say it here (or, if you are particularly confrontational, don't even say that). No verbal attacks, no insults, no hate speech. There are lots of other places on the internet for you to do that, this isn't one of them.

**2. Stay on topic.**

This is a subreddit about Prince George. It's not about Canada, it's not about British Columbia, and it's especially not about the party politics at either of those levels. Politics is ok if you follow rule 1, but keep it local: ie local candidates, local implications, not general discussions about province/country-wide issues.

**3. Check the sticky post before asking about moving here.**

We have a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/e4ck0e/the_moving_tovisitingwondering_aboutbest_of/) devoted to questions about moving to Prince George, as well as visiting, things to do, and different neighbourhoods. Read it before posting.

**4. No icky sales pitches or promotions.**

This isn't a place for coupons, crowdfunding campaigns or to raise money for your online startup. It's cool if you have an idea or even a business you want to promote, but be genuine about it, not just a salesperson who stops by once with a coupon code and then leaves. Yes, it tough to define ""icky"" so this might be controversial at times, but we're gonna delete posts that feel off to the tone of this subreddit.

**5. Don't hate on the city.**

Prince George isn't perfect, and it's ok to talk about that here, but be reasonable: it isn't a dump, the worst place in Canada, or the armpit of anything. If all you're doing is talking trash, head to the subreddit for a city you like.

The [greater Prince George area](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/fogs-spg/Facts-cma-eng.cfm?LANG=Eng&GK=CMA&GC=970&TOPIC=1) has a population of about 86,600 people but, as the largest community for hundreds of kilometers in all directions, it tends to punch above its weight in many respects because you aren't driving into a nearby metro area for an evening's entertainment. It is a government, service and healthcare hub, home to a college and university, and has a diversified enough economy that it isn't wholly dependent on any one or two industries, though forestry remains a vital driver along with mining, oil and gas and energy activity in other northern communities. It is at the confluence of the Fraser and Nechako Rivers and has many outdoor recreation opportunities.

Prince George is built on the unceded territory of the [Lheidli T'enneh First Nation](http://www.lheidli.ca/), who are frequently partners with the city on major initiatives, including the building of the University of Northern British Columbia and hosting of the 2015 Canada Winter Games.

# Transportation

Like most mid-sized Canadian communities that boomed in the mid-20th century, Prince George is a fairly car-centric city. But with the arrival of more and more post-secondary students, people are able to get around without their own wheels. [Here is a previous discussion about cars and transit in the city.](https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/38ltxc/is_having_a_car_necessary_in_pg/)

**Getting Around**

[u\/InfiNorth's Transit Map of Northern B.C.](https://preview.redd.it/aazz9rgekz141.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec260b19deb1fae7e00bedc570ace94ece744b0)

There are two taxi companies: [Prince George Taxi](https://pgtaxi.ca/) and [Emerald Taxi](http://emeraldtaxiltd.ca/). Both have online booking and apps

* There is [one bus system run by B.C. Transit](https://www.bctransit.com/prince-george/home). You can [find schedules online](https://www.bctransit.com/prince-george/schedules-and-maps), but it’s probably simplest to use the [Google Transit system](https://www.google.com/maps/dir///@53.9281566,-122.800152,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e3). Its Twitter is [@pgtransit](https://twitter.com/TransitPG).
* There are currently no official ride-hailing services operating in Prince George, but I’ll try to update when that changes.

**Getting To/From**

* For leaving town, there are two long-distance bus options. If you are headed north, east or west it is the provincially-run [BC Bus North](https://bcbus.ca/). If you’re headed south, it’s [Adventure Charters](https://www.adventurecharters.ca/)
* [Northern Health operates a bus service for patients and for people traveling with patients](https://nhconnections.ca/)
* We have an [international airport](https://www.pgairport.ca/) with multiple daily flights to Vancouver as well as regular flights to Calgary, Edmonton, Victoria, Kelowna and multiple communities around the north
* [ViaRail operates passenger trains to/from Prince Rupert and Jasper](https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/winter2018/44-45_Japser-PrinceGeorge-PrinceRupert.pdf)
* User u/InfiNorth has created a [subway-style map of Northern B.C. public transit options](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransitDiagrams/comments/d8q95p/northern_british_columbia_transit_network/)

# Air Quality

Back in the day, Prince George was a much more mill-based city than it is now, but the reputation of a certain odour… lingers. You can still smell the industrial activity in certain parts of town and under certain circumstances, but there have been dramatic improvements in industry standards in recent decades. If you’d like to learn more you can read up at the [Prince George Air Quality Improvement Roundtable](https://www.pgairquality.com/) or jump to the [official thread discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/princegeorge/comments/e4ck0e/the_moving_tovisitingwondering_aboutbest_of/f98ulf8/).
