My mom lives in Coombs. She is 62 years old and is feeling quite lonely, especially with all the Covid restrictions. She would really like to make some friends so she has someone to hangout with after work and especially on the weekends. I don't know what to do for her as all the activities that usually happen in the community have been cancelled and there aren't any opportunities for her to get out of the house and meet new people. I have noticed that her mental health has really deteriorated since Covid started. She is usually an upbeat person but now she is very sad and lonely. My mom is young for her age. She is fit. Her mind is sharp. She looks younger than she is. Does anyone have any advice on how she can make some friends or meet new people? I've searched everywhere online and can't find anything.
