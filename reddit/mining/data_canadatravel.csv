Just looking for some pointers / tips / tricks if anyone has something interesting to share about this.

I'm a young guy living in Quebec looking for a plan for a couple of weeks off this summer and can't really afford to fly abroad, so I figured I'd visit the rest of Canada!

Because of wildfires, my family won't let me go further west, so my only option is to pass through the Eastern Townships, New Brunswick, and possibly Nova Scotia, and then head back (since I suppose it's a bit optimistic to think I could perhaps visit PEI in that single trip as well)

I'm planning on taking 2 weeks off work, but I need to decide on the best dates for such a trip.

I don't have a driver's license or a friend who would be interested in coming along, and really want a solo travel experience honestly, so my options for transport are:
- bus
- train (I don't even know if it's feasible for my destinations)
- hitchhiking (I feel like it would be safe enough for a man, but could be wrong)

I also don't know what to expect in terms of places to sleep. Are there youth hostels around these parts?

Would really appreciate any input from people who have either done solo travelling in Canada or have done a similar itinerary and might have recommendations in terms of towns and parks to visit!

What precautions do we take as tourists? What are some do's and don'ts that you would suggest? Also, we are pure vegetarians - (no eggs as well) . Where can we find good vegetarian food in the places mentioned above?

****************UPDATE****************

Went through with the trip! Prior to that, I bought a Covid-19 travel insurance just in case I do end up contracting it while on vacation. On top of that, I got tested 3x (Antigen) before flying out of the country for peace of mind (paid for tests out of my own pocket). Alberta Health Services will not test you if you do not have any symptoms or close contact. When I arrived at the resort I was going to stay at, the first thing I did was book a PCR test 48 hours before my flight back home. Paid 1800 MXN for the test which took about 8 hours for the result to come out. PCR tests are not free, only antigens are. Set up ArriveCan on my phone before flying out of Mexico. You need both ArriveCan + Negative PCR result before they check you in. I flew with Swoop Airlines on the way to Mexico, and with WestJet back to Canada. My final destination is in Edmonton but I had a 2 hour layover in Vancouver. I was selected for the random mandatory testing done by Lifelabs. I believe they say Random, but I’m pretty sure mostly everyone if not all got tested. The procedure and testing was organized well, and it took about 20 minutes of my time for the whole thing.

Travel.gc.ca says we need a previous negative covid test between 14 - 180 days prior to flying. 

We fly in 3 weeks (Nov5), does this mean we need to get tested asap within the next few days? 

And do I also need to get a second test 3 days prior to flying as well?

we have been planning a trip to Canada for a long time (coming from Europe). Beginning from September 7 they announced that borders have been opened for those who are fully vaccinated  (which we are). I am wondering if the trip is realistic anytime soon wrt. Covid-19. Also because I don't really expect the situation to become much better anytime soon (waiting for the world to return to Pre-Covid state will be a very long wait).

I am in particular wondering about the quarantine requirements.

Other websites, such as [https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada), say that a quarantine plan is necessary ""in case you don’t qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller"". When I checked a few days ago, [travel.gc.ca](https://travel.gc.ca) was even self-contradictory, saying in one section that a quarantine plan is necessary \*even if fully vaccinated\*, while another section said that it is necessy ""in case you don’t qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller"". All of these pages seem to be official govermental sources. First question: Does anyone agree that there is contradictory information around or am I just confused?

In case one has to provide a quarantine plan even as a fully vaccined traveller (I assume this worst case for planning), does anyone have recent experience what will be accepted as a proper plan? Do you actually need to book a hotel for 14 days in case you need to quarantine, or can you just say that you \*would\* book this place in case you have to?

Hello, my friend and I are planning to drive soon to Quebec, Canada from New York State in the US for a touristic visit. We are fully vaccinated and I'm aware we will have to show a negative PCR test at the Canadian border taken within 72h. However, I have some questions related to this trip and I would appreciate if you could help me answering some of them, especially if you have been driving to Canada from the US recently:

\- If we drive to Canada and drive back to the US, do we need another negative Covid test to re-enter the US? My understanding is that we don't need a test to re-enter the US if we drive, only if we fly, but I could be wrong.

\- How strict are the covid restrictions in Canada? We are planning to visit Quebec and besides enjoy our stay at restaurants, hotels, bars or other public places open for tourists there but we are concerned with how strict the sanitary rules are there. Will we have to wear a mask all the time, outside and inside? In restaurants too? Will it even be possible to enter in restaurants/bars?

\- Finally, is now really the best time to visit Quebec/Montreal? The recent Canadian border opening to fully vaccinated Americans encouraged us to plan this short trip but now, we are having second thoughts of how practical and enjoyable our trip would be if the sanitary restrictions are too drastic. Should we postpone our trip?

### I’d like a refund. Why can’t I get a refund?

With respect to requests for refunds to original form of payment, more information will be provided at a later date. The Canadian Transportation Agency has also recently provided guidance on this, and you can find their statement here: [https://otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/statement-vouchers ](https://otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/statement-vouchers).

We are currently offering travel credit for transborder and international flights; more information can be found here: [https://www.flyswoop.com/making-changes-to-your-flight/](https://www.flyswoop.com/making-changes-to-your-flight/) .

They literally say they have not cancelled flights due to Covid, yet I have an email from them saying my flight is cancelled due to Covid.

I just realized my passport is expired (I'm from the US). I've called the government passport office for expediting but they have no appointments available. I've also tried paying a ridiculous amount for FedEx's expediting service, but it took 3 days of calling customer support while their phone lines were busy, just to find out that they cannot guarantee my passport in time. Lastly, I looked into the Nexus card but that wait list is at 1 month+.  
  
Is there any way I can legally get from Chicago to Calgary? I've considered driving straight up to the border and then taking a domestic flight within Canada, however my state does not issue the ""Enhanced Drivers License"" so I'm afraid I will be prohibited from plane travel altogether up there.
