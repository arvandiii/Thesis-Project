We as Canadians continue to learn and understand the depth and breadth of the mistreatment of Indigenous children at residential schools under a government policy of assimilation. A recent, dark, and tragic period in our Canadian story that we have a responsibility to face with open minds, humility, and compassion to improve our understanding, learn, and be part of the process of healing.

Today offers a continued opportunity for all members of the subreddit to pause, recognize, and reflect on the malicious legacy of residential schools. Please, seize the opportunity by participating and learning for the betterment of our society.

À l’occasion de la Journée nationale de la vérité et de la réconciliation, nous aimerions encourager tous les membres de r/Canada à marquer le 30 septembre comme une journée d’action et de réflexion.

En tant que Canadiens, nous continuons d’apprendre et de comprendre la profondeur et l’ampleur des mauvais traitements infligés aux enfants autochtones dans les pensionnats dans le cadre d’une politique gouvernementale d’assimilation. Une période récente, sombre et tragique de notre histoire canadienne à laquelle nous avons la responsabilité d'affronter avec un esprit ouvert, humilité et compassion pour améliorer notre compréhension, apprendre et faire partie du processus de guérison.

Aujourd’hui, tous les membres du subreddit ont l’occasion de faire une pause, de reconnaître et de réfléchir à l’héritage malveillant des pensionnats. S'il vous plaît, saisissez l'opportunité en participant et en apprenant pour le bien de notre société.

This cop stole money from a homicide scene he was supposed to protect, and only confessed when he figured he was on camera. They later ran sting operations to see if he would steal evidence and he did, stealing cash from a car he was supposed to search and money from a “lost” purse an undercover officer had brought him to test him.

He was later convicted of two criminal offenses. He was then fired, which he appealed and won, and will now be reinstated get backpay totaling almost half a million dollars for the years of leave without pay.
 

If you call the police in Edmonton, be careful, you might have a convicted thief show up and steal your belongings. 


Imagine being convicted of 2 crimes including theft, done on the job and keeping your job.

Why are so few young Canadians attracted to the idea  of service above self, and the prospect of doing exciting, demanding,  and immensely rewarding jobs?  Do they need to be asked to step up?

This  past week various news outlets have reported on multiple recruitment  crises in front-line agencies. Volunteer fire departments are down some  30,000 volunteers from a previous high.  The RCMP and other police  services across the country are struggling to meet recruitment targets.   And the military is vastly under-strength (by 16,000 members) and is  not attracting anywhere near the numbers needed to meet the needs of its  various missions.

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/volunteer-firefighter-shortage-new-brunswick-1.6865721](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/volunteer-firefighter-shortage-new-brunswick-1.6865721)

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-duheme-recruitment-1.6937969](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-duheme-recruitment-1.6937969)

It's  commonplace for the news media to cast blame for these problems on poor  working conditions, scandals and under-funding, but are those  explanations adequate?  Recruitment campaigns all seem to take the  approach of appealing to the selfish gene: join us: here is what we  offer you!  No-one these days is appealing to the notion of service  above self.  No-one is asking the younger generation to step up,  shoulder some of the burden, or do their duty.   We just NEVER hear that  kind of thing anymore.

What gives, Canada?  What needs to change?

>OPP say people should avoid engaging with members of biker gangs after violence broke out between two rival motorcycle clubs in eastern Ontario this week.

The situation is serious enough that the OPP is even cautioning people not to wear gang-related clothing, as it could make them targets of biker violence.

Saturday evening, police say a fight between two biker gangs in Cornwall, Ont., the Outlaws and the Loners, left three people injured, two with stab wounds and another with gunshot wounds.

Less than two days later, the Outlaws hangout in Brockville, Ont., was severely burned in a fire that spread to nearly a dozen other homes in the area, police said.

This is why Wade and the OPP’s biker gang unit thought it best to ask the community to avoid wearing gang paraphernalia at this time.

In the 156 years since Confederation, our country has experienced great change and growth. Today we celebrate the country we all are fortunate enough to call home.

The last couple of years have been extremely challenging for many Canadians. While last year we saw a return to in-person and community celebrations, this year, thousands of Canadians are now being impacted by wildfires removing them from their homes and communities. As you celebrate, think of those who are unable to enjoy the weekend and who remain impacted. Please also look to your local fire and firework restrictions to ensure you are safe and responsible. While we might not be able to celebrate Canada Day in the ways we are used to – we are still incredibly lucky to live in a beautiful country that offers us so much incredible natural beauty and amazing people.

​

Throughout the weekend, the moderation will be relaxed to allow more content to be shared. Please share your Canadiana, your experiences, and how you are choosing to spend your Canada Day weekend. We encourage you to share here in this thread, or in your own posts, all of your long weekend traditions and experiences in our great country.

As many Canadians will choose to celebrate Canada Day, we must also respect those who choose to reflect on Canada’s past treatment of indigenous people. Every individual will make their own choice as to how they will spend their Canada Day, and we should be respectful of each other. We would all benefit from understanding our past and our country's relationship with the Indigenous people of Canada.

Regardless of how you choose to spend your Canada Day, please be safe and drink (or smoke) responsibly.

Bonne fête du Canada r/Canada !

Au cours des 156 années qui se sont écoulées depuis la Confédération, notre pays a connu de grands changements et une grande croissance. Aujourd'hui, nous célébrons le pays que nous avons tous la chance d'appeler chez nous.

Les deux dernières années ont été extrêmement difficiles pour de nombreux Canadiens. Alors que l'année dernière, nous avons vu un retour aux célébrations en personne et communautaires, cette année, des milliers de Canadiens sont maintenant touchés par des incendies de forêt qui les chassent de leurs maisons et de leurs communautés. Pendant que vous célébrez, pensez à ceux qui ne peuvent pas profiter du week-end et qui restent touchés. Veuillez également consulter les restrictions locales en matière d'incendie et de feux d'artifice pour vous assurer que vous êtes en sécurité et responsable. Bien que nous ne puissions peut-être pas célébrer la fête du Canada comme nous en avons l'habitude, nous sommes toujours incroyablement chanceux de vivre dans un beau pays qui nous offre une beauté naturelle incroyable et des gens incroyables.

​

Tout au long du week-end, la modération sera assouplie pour permettre de partager plus de contenu. Veuillez partager votre Canadiana, vos expériences et comment vous choisissez de passer votre week-end de la fête du Canada. Nous vous encourageons à partager ici dans ce fil, ou dans vos propres messages, toutes vos traditions et expériences de long week-end dans notre grand pays.

Comme de nombreux Canadiens choisiront de célébrer la fête du Canada, nous devons également respecter ceux qui choisissent de réfléchir au traitement passé des peuples autochtones par le Canada. Chaque personne fera son propre choix quant à la façon dont elle passera sa fête du Canada, et nous devons nous respecter les uns les autres. Nous gagnerions tous à comprendre notre passé et la relation de notre pays avec les peuples autochtones du Canada.

""Agok was under court orders not to leave his house, possess weapons or associate with McIntyre (another one of the 3 shooters) at the time of his arrest, according to court documents that listed the drugs seized Friday as fentanyl, cocaine and oxycodone""

Both out on bail, or house arrest, from previous firearm and drug related offences that took place only 1 year ago. They are under court orders to not associate with each other and are under a weapons prohibiton. Both still associate and get guns illegally and get into a shootout. 

The removal of the mandatory minimum sentencing for firearm related offences, with the additon of bail reform has only further insentavised criminals and puts them back on our streets to continue commiting crimes. My home town, London, has seen an unprecedented 11 shootings in just 4 months. 

The London Police Service shows on their website a statistic comparison of crimes commited for the years 2017-2021. In 2017 violent crimes (assault, sexual assault, robbery, attempt murder & murder) shows 2,148 charges laid. In 2021 is shows 3,142 charges laid. 2022 was a bad year for crime and i imagine the stats would follow the upward trend. And so far, 2023 is already beating out 2022. I don't feel safe in my city. The government needs to wake up and address the real issues to reduce crime. 

Go after the illegal gun market instead of spending billions of tax payer dollars and police resources on law abiding citizen gun owners. Instead put that money into CBSA to better equip them in stopping illegal guns from entering. Put that money into addressing the mental health and housing crisis. The rates of homelessness, mental health and addictions is stagering in London, we are drowning. 

They need to de-centivise criminals by bringing back mandatory sentencing for firearm related offences. They need to revamp their bail system so we dont waste police resources arresting the same person 2-3 times a day. 

This is a massive issue that is happening all across our country. Im fearful for the future if nothing meaningful is done to address the crime rates in this country.",canada,"Police charge two men with attempted murder, seek third in core shootout",0.72,https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/two-men-charged-in-downtown-shootout-police-seek-third

Like many of you, we have only just begun to learn and understand the depth and breadth of the mistreatment of Indigenous children at residential schools under a government policy of assimilation. A recent, dark, and tragic period in our Canadian story that we have a responsibility to face with open minds, humility, and compassion to improve our understanding, learn, and be part of the process of healing.

Today offers a continued opportunity for all members of the subreddit to pause, recognize, and reflect on the malicious legacy of residential schools. Please, seize the opportunity by participating and learning for the betterment of our society.

**Opportunities to participate:**

* Both the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation and Orange Shirt Day take place today. Orange Shirt Day is an Indigenous-led, grassroots commemorative day that honours the children who survived Indian Residential Schools and remembers those who did not.
* There are various sacred Fires and Vigils in cities across the country that are held from sunrise to sunset today. We encourage you to seek out one in yours to respectfully participate in.
* CBC is hosting a series of Indigenous-led programming for television and radio audiences.  Links and details for these programs and offerings can be found [here](https://www.cbc.ca/arts/how-to-watch-and-listen-to-national-day-for-truth-and-reconciliation-2022-on-cbc-1.6595830)

It’s one of our most sought-after boot leg recordings. Now is your chance to ask us (Paul Langlois and Gord Sinclair) anything you so desire. We don’t usually do this kind of thing, but today we are going to try and give some earnest answers. Now is your chance : )

Originally recorded on May 3, 1991, at the iconic Los Angeles venue for a Westwood One radio show, only 40 minutes of the set was broadcasted on air at the time, making the full recording that much more in demand. Don Smith, producer on Up To Here and Road Apples, mixed and recorded the Roxy concert in full outside of the venue from the mobile studio.

We remember the Roxy show like it was yesterday. We had spent a year on the road before recording Road Apples and got right back in the saddle when we finished. The new tunes worked great live and by the time we got to LA we were firing on all pistons.

A great show is something you just have to experience to understand. The magic stays with you. Listening back 30 years later and I’m transported to that hot, sweaty, and very special night. The band was tight and unstoppable. Great crowd, great venue. Together we took things to another level.

With all tracks completely remastered in 2021 by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in Nashville, the album features the fan favourite “Killer Whale Tank” version of “New Orleans Is Sinking.” The nine-minute track is characterized by mid-song story from Gord D. about a job cleaning an aquarium and inadvertently causing friction between the two whales held in the tank, fact or fiction, while the crowd listens in wonderment.

We are bringing this release to fruition after countless requests for the deep cut versions of these songs.

&#x200B;

Feel free to take the time to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming New Year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over Hanukkah and Christmas Day. Many of us will find ourselves shovelling snow, tending to homemade rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it is a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities!

&#x200B;

 Challenges of COVID-19, flu, and other respiratory virus remain prevalent this year and severe snow conditions are creating dangerous travel conditions. With these in mind, please be safe, look after yourselves and others, and listen to local guidance towards how you can continue to be safe and healthy this holiday season.

&#x200B;

While many of us turn our attention towards our families, the holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many Canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. Many users here may feel isolated, or may be in crisis, but you are not alone. There are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. If you or someone you love is in crisis, we encourage you to reach out, talk, and get help. We know it is not easy to take that first step to realize you need help.

&#x200B;

For those of you who have served, we encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. If you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, the CF Member Assistance Program Crisis and Referral Centre can be contacted 24/7 at 1-800-268-7708 (TTY: 1-800-567-5803 for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing). Recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. You are not alone.

&#x200B;

We hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. No matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. Every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. Please do not drink and drive.

&#x200B;

Our thoughts are also with the thousands of first responders working through the holidays and those deployed overseas serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. Those on the front lines are keeping us going through this pandemic, keeping us fed, healthy and moving forward.

&#x200B;

Look after each other, and always remember there is a person at the other side of the screen. We encourage everyone takes the opportunity to be kinder to each other and remember that with renewed focus on mental health, being kind to those you may disagree with can make everyone's experience more positive.
We encourage you to share pictures, stories and experiences you have had this year (or previous years) to help spread a positive holiday spirit.

&#x200B;

We hope you all had a joyous and Happy Hanukkah, and enjoy a Merry Christmas, a great holiday, and a very happy New Year!

*****************

Au nom de l'équipe de modération de r/Canada, nous profitons de l'occasion pour vous souhaiter à tous de bonnes fêtes de fin d'année, un joyeux Noël et une bonne année.

&#x200B;

N'hésitez pas à prendre le temps de partager avec la communauté vos vœux pour la nouvelle année à venir, vos propres traditions de vacances ou vos expériences pendant Hanoukka et le jour de Noël. Beaucoup d'entre nous seront amenés à pelleter de la neige, à s'occuper de patinoires artisanales ou à déguster des friandises spéciales pendant les fêtes et c'est le moment idéal pour partager nos activités de vacances uniques (et souvent très similaires) !

&#x200B;

 Les défis posés par le COVID-19, la grippe et d'autres virus respiratoires restent prévalents cette année et les conditions de neige sévères créent des conditions de voyage dangereuses. Dans ce contexte, soyez prudents, prenez soin de vous et des autres, et écoutez les conseils locaux sur la façon dont vous pouvez continuer à être en sécurité et en bonne santé pendant les fêtes.

&#x200B;

Alors que beaucoup d'entre nous tournent leur attention vers leur famille, la saison des fêtes peut également être une période difficile et stressante pour de nombreux Canadiens, alors un mot gentil ou le simple fait de tendre la main à un vieil ami pour lui dire bonjour peut signifier beaucoup à cette période de l'année. De nombreux utilisateurs peuvent se sentir isolés ou en situation de crise, mais vous n'êtes pas seuls. Il existe des ressources pour vous aider, ou même pour avoir quelqu'un à qui parler. Si vous, ou l'un de vos proches, êtes en crise, nous vous encourageons à tendre la main, à parler et à obtenir de l'aide. Nous savons qu'il n'est pas facile de faire le premier pas pour réaliser que vous avez besoin d'aide.

&#x200B;

Pour ceux d'entre vous qui ont servi, nous vous encourageons à tendre la main à vos frères et sœurs, le simple fait d'entendre une voix amicale peut faire la différence entre la vie et la mort. Si vous êtes un ancien combattant ou un membre actif en crise, il existe de l'aide, le Centre d'orientation et de crise du Programme d'aide aux membres des FC peut être contacté 24/7 au 1-800-268-7708 (ATS : 1-800-567-5803 pour les personnes sourdes ou malentendantes). Reconnaître que vous avez besoin d'aide est aussi important que d'obtenir le soutien et l'aide dont vous avez besoin. Vous n'êtes pas seul.

&#x200B;

Nous espérons que vous passerez tous des fêtes de fin d'année en toute sécurité. Quelle que soit la façon dont vous les célébrez, soyez prudents et n'oubliez pas de ne pas boire (ou fumer) et de ne pas conduire. Chaque année, nous voyons des articles tragiques sur des familles déchirées à la suite d'accidents évitables. S'il vous plaît, ne buvez pas et ne conduisez pas.

&#x200B;

Nos pensées vont également aux milliers de premiers intervenants qui travaillent pendant les fêtes et à ceux qui sont déployés à l'étranger dans les Forces armées canadiennes. Ceux qui sont en première ligne nous permettent de traverser cette pandémie, de nous nourrir, de rester en bonne santé et d'aller de l'avant.

&#x200B;

Prenez soin les uns des autres et n'oubliez jamais qu'il y a une personne de l'autre côté de l'écran. Nous encourageons tout le monde à saisir l'occasion d'être plus gentil les uns envers les autres et à se rappeler qu'avec le regain d'intérêt pour la santé mentale, être gentil avec ceux avec qui vous pouvez être en désaccord peut rendre l'expérience de chacun plus positive.
Nous vous encourageons à partager des photos, des histoires et des expériences que vous avez vécues cette année (ou les années précédentes) pour aider à répandre un esprit de vacances positif.",canada,Happy Holidays and Joyeux Noël!,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/zuqyj9/happy_holidays_and_joyeux_noël/

In the 155 years since Confederation our country has experienced great change and growth. Today we celebrate the country we all are fortunate enough to call home. 

The last couple years have been extremely challenging for many Canadians, and in many communities will see the resumption of in person Canada Day celebrations. While we might not be able to celebrate Canada Day in the ways we are used to – we are still incredibly lucky to live in a beautiful country that offers us so much incredible natural beauty and amazing people.

​

Throughout the weekend the moderation will be relaxed in allow more content to be shared. Please share your Canadiana, your experiences, and how you are choosing to spend your Canada Day weekend. We encourage you to share here in this thread, or in your own posts, your traditions and experiences in our great country. 

As many Canadians will choose to celebrate Canada Day, we must also respect those who choose not to in order to reflect on Canada’s past treatment of indigenous people. Every individual will make their own choice as to how they will spend their Canada Day and we should be respectful of each other. We would all benefit from understanding our past and our country's relationship with the Indigenous people of Canada.

Au cours des 155 années qui se sont écoulées depuis la Confédération, notre pays a connu de grands changements et une grande croissance. Aujourd'hui, nous célébrons le pays que nous avons tous la chance d'appeler chez nous.

Les deux dernières années ont été extrêmement difficiles pour de nombreux Canadiens et, dans de nombreuses communautés, nous verrons la reprise des célébrations en personne de la fête du Canada. Bien que nous ne puissions peut-être pas célébrer la fête du Canada comme nous en avons l'habitude, nous sommes toujours incroyablement chanceux de vivre dans un beau pays qui nous offre une beauté naturelle incroyable et des gens incroyables.

Tout au long du week-end, la modération sera assouplie pour permettre le partage de plus de contenu. Veuillez partager votre Canadiana, vos expériences et comment vous choisissez de passer votre week-end de la fête du Canada. Nous vous encourageons à partager ici dans ce fil, ou dans vos propres messages, vos traditions et expériences dans notre grand pays. Comme de nombreux Canadiens choisiront de célébrer la fête du Canada, nous devons également respecter ceux qui choisissent de ne pas le faire afin de réfléchir au traitement passé des peuples autochtones au Canada.

&#x200B;

Chaque personne fera son propre choix quant à la façon dont elle passera sa fête du Canada et nous devons nous respecter les uns les autres. Quelle que soit la façon dont nous choisissons de passer notre fête du Canada, nous gagnerions tous à comprendre notre passé et la relation de notre pays avec les peuples autochtones du Canada.

Au nom de toute l'équipe de modération, passez une fête du Canada en toute sécurité, en bonne santé et heureuse !

Feel free to take this opportunity to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming New Year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over Hanukkah and Christmas Day. Many of us will find ourselves on homemade rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it is a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities!

&#x200B;

Unfortunately challenges of COVID-19 this year will make the holiday celebrations different than most years.  Public health measures will ultimately change many of our plans, but through technology many of us still will try to find new ways to connect with friends and family this time of year. With the emergence of the Omicron variant and its high transmissibility, please remember to consult your local health guidance and adopt measures to keep you and your loved ones safe and healthy this holiday season. 

While many of us turn our attention towards our families, the Holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many Canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. With COVID-19 restrictions, many users here may feel isolated, or may be in crisis, but you are not alone. There are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. If you or someone you love is in crisis, we encourage you to reach out, talk, and get help. We know it is not easy to take that first step to realize you need help.

&#x200B;

For those of you who have served, we encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. If you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, Veterans Affairs maintains a 24/7 line to help those who need mental health support (1-800-268-7708). Recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. You are not alone.

&#x200B;

We hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. No matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. Every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. Please do not drink and drive. If your province allows for gatherings over the holidays, remember to do a self-assessment and stay home if you have symptoms of COVID-19. Get tested and help keep your family safe.

&#x200B;

Our thoughts are also with the thousands of first responders working through the holidays and those deployed overseas serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. Those on the front lines are keeping us going through this pandemic, keeping us fed, healthy and moving forward.

&#x200B;

This year will be different, but please make smart choices so that your friends and family are here next year to enjoy Christmas when we will be able to come together once more.

&#x200B;

Look after each other, and always remember there is a person at the other side of the screen. We encourage everyone takes the opportunity to be kinder to each other and remember that with renewed focus on mental health, being kind to those you may disagree with can make everyone's experience more positive

We encourage you to share pictures, stories and experiences you have had this year (or previous years) to help spread a positive holiday spirit.

&#x200B;

We hope you all had a joyous and Happy Hanukkah, and enjoy a Merry Christmas, a great holiday, and a very happy New Year!

&#x200B;

Au nom de l'équipe de modération de r/Canada, nous profitons de l'occasion pour vous souhaiter à tous un joyeux Noël et une bonne année.

N'hésitez pas à profiter de cette occasion pour partager avec la communauté vos meilleurs vœux pour la nouvelle année à venir, vos propres traditions de vacances ou vos expériences pendant Hanoukka et le jour de Noël. Beaucoup d'entre nous se retrouveront sur des patinoires maison ou profiteront de friandises spéciales pendant les vacances et c'est le moment idéal pour partager nos activités de vacances uniques (et souvent très similaires) !

&#x200B;

Malheureusement, les défis de COVID-19 cette année rendront les célébrations des fêtes différentes de la plupart des années. Les mesures de santé publique finiront par changer bon nombre de nos plans, mais grâce à la technologie, beaucoup d'entre nous essaieront toujours de trouver de nouvelles façons de se connecter avec leurs amis et leur famille à cette période de l'année. Avec l'émergence de la variante Omicron et sa transmissibilité élevée, n'oubliez pas de consulter vos conseils de santé locaux et d'adopter des mesures pour vous garder, vous et vos proches, en sécurité et en bonne santé en cette période des fêtes.

&#x200B;

Alors que beaucoup d'entre nous tournent leur attention vers nos familles, la période des Fêtes peut également être une période difficile et stressante pour de nombreux Canadiens, alors un mot gentil ou simplement tendre la main à un vieil ami pour lui dire bonjour peut signifier beaucoup à cette période de l'année. . Avec les restrictions COVID-19, de nombreux utilisateurs ici peuvent se sentir isolés ou être en crise, mais vous n'êtes pas seul. Il existe des ressources pour vous aider, ou même pour avoir quelqu'un à qui parler. Si vous ou quelqu'un que vous aimez êtes en crise, je vous encourage à tendre la main, à parler et à obtenir de l'aide. Je sais qu'il n'est pas facile de faire le premier pas pour réaliser que vous avez besoin d'aide.

&#x200B;

Pour ceux d'entre vous qui ont servi, je vous encourage à tendre la main à vos frères et sœurs, le simple fait d'entendre une voix amicale peut faire la différence entre la vie et la mort. Si vous êtes un ancien combattant ou un membre actif en situation de crise, il existe de l'aide, Anciens Combattants Canada maintient une ligne 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7 pour aider ceux qui ont besoin d'un soutien en santé mentale (1 800 268-7708). Reconnaître que vous avez besoin d'aide est aussi important que d'obtenir le soutien et l'aide dont vous avez besoin. Tu n'es pas seul.

&#x200B;

Nous espérons que vous passez tous de bonnes fêtes de fin d'année en toute sécurité. Peu importe comment vous célébrez, soyez prudent et rappelez-vous de ne pas boire (ou fumer) et conduire. Chaque année, nous voyons des articles tragiques sur des familles déchirées à la suite d'accidents évitables. Merci de ne pas boire et conduire. Si votre province autorise les rassemblements pendant les vacances, n'oubliez pas de faire une auto-évaluation et de rester à la maison si vous présentez des symptômes de COVID-19. Faites-vous tester et aidez à garder votre famille en sécurité.

&#x200B;

Nos pensées vont également aux milliers de premiers intervenants qui travaillent pendant les vacances et à ceux qui sont déployés à l'étranger pour servir dans les Forces armées canadiennes. Ceux qui sont en première ligne nous aident à traverser cette pandémie, à nous nourrir, à rester en bonne santé et à aller de l'avant.

Cette année sera différente, mais s'il vous plaît faites des choix intelligents pour que vos amis et votre famille soient ici l'année prochaine pour profiter de Noël lorsque nous pourrons nous réunir une fois de plus.

&#x200B;

Prenez soin les uns des autres et souvenez-vous toujours qu'il y a une personne de l'autre côté de l'écran. Nous encourageons tout le monde à profiter de l'occasion pour être plus gentils les uns envers les autres et n'oubliez pas qu'avec un accent renouvelé sur la santé mentale, être gentil avec ceux avec qui vous pouvez être en désaccord peut rendre l'expérience de chacun plus positive.

&#x200B;

Nous vous encourageons à partager des photos, des histoires et des expériences que vous avez vécues cette année (ou les années précédentes) pour aider à répandre un esprit de vacances positif.

&#x200B;

Nous espérons que vous avez tous passé une joyeuse et heureuse Hanoucca, et que vous profitez d'un joyeux Noël, d'excellentes vacances et d'une très bonne année !",canada,Joyeux Noël and Happy Holidays!,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/rnz1sq/joyeux_noël_and_happy_holidays/

Floods have wiped out major transport routes in southwest BC. The Port of Vancouver is now cut off from the rest of Canada by road and rail, and towns have been evacuated due to flooding. The situation is developing, but the important thing is to stay safe.

This megathread is here to boost visibility for resources for those affected, compile what news we have to date, and support discussion about the floods.

Feel free to take this opportunity to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming New Year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over Hanukkah and Christmas Day. Many of us will find ourselves on homemade rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it is a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities!

Unfortunately challenges of COVID-19 this year will make the holiday celebrations different than most years.  Lockdowns and other public health measures will ultimately limit our gatherings, but through technology many of us still will try to find new ways to connect with friends and family this time of year.  While last  year I suggested the season is a great time to spend time with friends and family, and I encouraged you all to put down the phones, tablets and whatever device you use, and take a break – well ignore that.  Pick up those tablets and phones and connect with friends and family virtually.  Follow the guidance of your local public health authorities and keep each other safe and healthy.  

While many of us turn our attention towards our families, the Holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many Canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. With COVID-19 restrictions, many users here may feel isolated, or may be in crisis, but you are not alone. There are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. If you or someone you love is in crisis, I encourage you to reach out, talk, and get help. I know it is not easy to take that first step to realize you need help.

For those of you who have served, I encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. If you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, Veterans Affairs maintains a 24/7 line to help those who need mental health support (1-800-268-7708). Recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. You are not alone.

We hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. No matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. Every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. Please do not drink and drive. If your province allows for gatherings over the holidays, remember to do a self-assessment and stay home if you have symptoms of COVID-19.  Get tested and help keep your family safe. 

Our thoughts are also with the thousands of first responders working through the holidays and those deployed overseas serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. Those on the front lines are keeping us going through this pandemic, keeping us fed, healthy and moving forward. 

This year will be different, but please make smart choices so that your friends and family are here next year to enjoy Christmas when we will be able to come together once more.  

Thank you for your sacrifices and hardships over the last year while many of us aim to enjoy safe and festive times with our families.
Look after each other, and always remember there is a person at the other side of the screen. I encourage everyone takes the opportunity to be kinder to each other and remember that with renewed focus on mental health, being kind to those you may disagree with can make everyone's experience more positive

I encourage you to share pictures, stories and experiences you have had this year (or previous  years) to help spread a positive holiday spirit.

I hope you all had a joyous and Happy Hanukkah, and enjoy a Merry Christmas, a great holiday, and a very happy New Year!",canada,Joyeux Noël and Happy Holidays!,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/kjt7h9/joyeux_noël_and_happy_holidays/

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [420,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO has classified it as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures. [A short GIF](https://i.imgur.com/KpJWSm4.gif) on how we stop the virus from spreading.** 

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, [wash your hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fmjbsk/washing_your_hands_is_more_effective_than_hand/) and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Wear a mask in public when possible ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fmla3q/sarscov1_frequent_mask_use_in_public_venues/) | [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html))

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* [Take extra precautions when shopping for groceries, even when buying online.](https://www.consumerreports.org/food-shopping/how-to-protect-yourself-from-coronavirus-when-grocery-shopping/?EXTKEY=EE032IBAC&utm_source=acxiom)

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days.

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* **UPDATE:** March 20th: [Comorbidities in Italy published](https://www.covidgraph.com/p/coronavirus.html#comorbidities). 48.6% of deceased had 3+ comorbidities.

* **UPDATE:** March 22nd: [Study Calculates Just How Much Age, Medical Conditions Raise Odds Of Severe COVID-19](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/22/819846180/study-calculates-just-how-much-age-medical-conditions-raise-odds-of-severe-covid?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=health)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response measures taken, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to vulnerable others, but because experts don't know what the longterm side effects are. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

Take precautions, or [this can happen to you](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/the-story-of-a-coronavirus-infection.html?__twitter_impression=true).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin. March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)). A genome analysis published March 20th suggests two viruses may have combined ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-origins-genome-analysis-covid19-data-science-bats-pangolins/)).

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. Nonetheless, to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), which will be kept up to date (as will any PSA I posted myself, as long as it's still on the main page of your sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

I was considering staying at a bud and breakfast property as my partner has some mental disabilities, and cannabis helps him to cope with them. My main question is what exactly should I tell the border agent going into Canada if they ask where I'm staying. I'd be honest given it's not against the law federally in Canada, but I'm more worried about the return trip and getting grilled by CBP about it on my way home. I also don't necessarily want to mention it because I plan on enrolling ourselves in nexus, which I'm aware my country would deny/revoke it at the slightest mention of cannabis :/

I've also been trying to find cannabis-friendly lodging through other channels, but I can't seem to find any hotels, motels, or bed and breakfasts that are cannabis/smoking friendly. A lot of places are vague to mentioning if they even have an outdoor smoking area.

Also, I'd love to know other areas of Canada that are within a half days drive worth checking out.

Feel free to take this opportunity to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming New Year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over Hanukkah and Christmas day. Many of us will find ourselves on home made rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it's a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities!

The holiday, season is a great time to spend time with friends and family, and I encourage you all to put down the phones, tablets and whatever device you use, and take a break. The holidays are a great time to take a break from the devices and focus on yourself, friends, and familiy.

While many of us turn our attention towards our families, the Holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many Canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. Some users here may feel alone, or may be in crisis, you are not alone. There are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. If you or someone you love is in crisis, I encourage you to get help. I know it is not easy to take that first step and realize you need help.

For those of you who have served, I encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. If you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, Veterans Affairs maintains a 24/7 line to help those who need mental health support (1-800-268-7708). Recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. You are not alone.

We hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. No matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. Every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. Please do not drink and drive, and if you are going to drink, take a cab or use a designated driver. Services like Operation Red Nose are available across Canada. There is no excuse. It is common sense, but sadly every year hundreds of Canadians lose their lives in fatal accidents where alcohol was involved.

Our thoughts are also with the thousands of first responders working through the holidays and those deployed overseas serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. Thank you for your service and sacrifices while many of us aim to enjoy safe and festive times with our families.

Look after each other, and always remember there is a person at the other side of the screen.

The Captain kept a-lookin' at the watch upon his wrist;
And there we smoked and squatted, as we watched the shrapnel flame;
'Twas wonnerful, I'm tellin' you, how fast them bullets came.
'Twas weary work the waiting, though; I tried to sleep a wink,
For waitin' means a-thinkin', and it doesn't do to think.
So I closed my eyes a little, and I had a niceish dream
Of a-standin' by a dresser with a dish of Devon cream;
But I hadn't time to sample it, for suddenlike I woke:
""Come on, me lads!"" the Captain says, 'n I climbed out through the smoke.


We spread out in the open: it was like a bath of lead;
But the boys they cheered and hollered fit to raise the bloody dead,
Till a beastly bullet copped 'em, then they lay without a sound,
And it's odd -- we didn't seem to heed them corpses on the ground.
And I kept on thinkin', thinkin', as the bullets faster flew,
How they picks the werry best men, and they lets the rotters through;
So indiscriminatin' like, they spares a man of sin,
And a rare lad wot's a husband and a father gets done in.
And while havin' these reflections and advancin' on the run,
A bullet biffs me shoulder, and says I: ""That's number one.""


Well, it downed me for a jiffy, but I didn't lose me calm,
For I knew that I was needed: I'm a bomber, so I am.
I 'ad lost me cap and rifle, but I ""carried on"" because
I 'ad me bombs and knew that they was needed, so they was.
We didn't 'ave no singin' now, nor many men to cheer;
Maybe the shrapnel drowned 'em, crashin' out so werry near;
And the Maxims got us sideways, and the bullets faster flew,
And I copped one on me flipper, and says I: ""That's number two.""


I was pleased it was the left one, for I 'ad me bombs, ye see,
And 'twas 'ard if they'd be wasted like, and all along o' me.
And I'd lost me 'at and rifle -- but I told you that before,
So I packed me mit inside me coat and ""carried on"" once more.
But the rumpus it was wicked, and the men were scarcer yet,
And I felt me ginger goin', but me jaws I kindo set,
And we passed the Boche first trenches, which was 'eapin' 'igh with dead,
And we started for their second, which was fifty feet ahead;
When something like a 'ammer smashed me savage on the knee,
And down I came all muck and blood: Says I: ""That's number three.""


So there I lay all 'elpless like, and bloody sick at that,
And worryin' like anythink, because I'd lost me 'at;
And thinkin' of me missis, and the partin' words she said:
""If you gets killed, write quick, ol' man, and tell me as you're dead.""
And lookin' at me bunch o' bombs -- that was the 'ardest blow,
To think I'd never 'ave the chance to 'url them at the foe.
And there was all our boys in front, a-fightin' there like mad,
And me as could 'ave 'elped 'em wiv the lovely bombs I 'ad.
And so I cussed and cussed, and then I struggled back again,
Into that bit of battered trench, packed solid with its slain.


Now as I lay a-lyin' there and blastin' of me lot,
And wishin' I could just dispose of all them bombs I'd got,
I sees within the doorway of a shy, retirin' dug-out
Six Boches all a-grinnin', and their Captain stuck 'is mug out;
And they 'ad a nice machine gun, and I twigged what they was at;
And they fixed it on a tripod, and I watched 'em like a cat;
And they got it in position, and they seemed so werry glad,
Like they'd got us in a death-trap, which, condemn their souls! they 'ad.
For there our boys was fightin' fifty yards in front, and 'ere
This lousy bunch of Boches they 'ad got us in the rear.


Oh it set me blood a-boilin' and I quite forgot me pain,
So I started crawlin', crawlin' over all them mounds of slain;
And them barstards was so busy-like they 'ad no eyes for me,
And me bleedin' leg was draggin', but me right arm it was free. . . .
And now they 'ave it all in shape, and swingin' sweet and clear;
And now they're all excited like, but -- I am drawin' near;
And now they 'ave it loaded up, and now they're takin' aim. . . .
Rat-tat-tat-tat! Oh here, says I, is where I join the game.
And my right arm it goes swingin', and a bomb it goes a-slingin',
And that ""typewriter"" goes wingin' in a thunderbolt of flame.


Then these Boches, wot was left of 'em, they tumbled down their 'ole,
And up I climbed a mound of dead, and down on them I stole.
And oh that blessed moment when I heard their frightened yell,
And I laughed down in that dug-out, ere I bombed their souls to hell.
And now I'm in the hospital, surprised that I'm alive;
We started out a thousand men, we came back thirty-five.
And I'm minus of a trotter, but I'm most amazin' gay,

So, I recently moved to Canada, and I am finding it a bit difficult to figure out which brands would be the closest to the ones I used to smoke in my home country. Additionally, because of the local laws, the convenience stores don’t even have the brands out in the open for me to be able to check them out and choose. 

I was wondering if you guys could suggest a few brands that I can try and figure out what works for me. I am looking for something unflavoured, mild, and preferably allows me to burst a bubble to switch to menthol once in a while.

My university acceptance was founded (in part) on my efforts to change the law in California via ballot initiative.  Jody Wilson Raybould and the rest of the federal Liberals did a good job on this file for the most part.  I mean, it could use some improvement, but everything could use some improvement.  That's just the way it is.

Like the Surgeon General's Warning, for example.  Whose bright idea was it to make it maybe a third of the size of the tobacco warning, with no ""pretty"" pictures?  I think it's only fair to reduce the size of the tobacco warning to match, or to make the cannabis warning bigger.  Like I said, though, the Liberals did a good job, pretty much.

Which is why I'm surprised at how badly the provincial governments bungled the situation on their end.  They had the chance to give the economy a good kick in the pants, had they implemented the appropriate revenue tools.  

For example, the only provinces with a smart policy on grow-at-home ops are Manitoba and Québec.  Letting people grow at home without any kind of licence takes money out of the pockets of the fine shareholders of Aphria, Aurora, Mettrum etc., but also out of the Government purse, because Licenced Producers pay taxes, and J. Random Gardner doesn't.  This is why we don't let people distil their own gin. 

The second big issue from my perspective is letting people consume it in public.  Québec is wrong here, as is BC, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Alberta.  It is a bad idea from a public health and nuisance abatement perspective (smoke inhalation is not healthy, full stop, especially when it smells like a skunk farted) but more importantly, from a public morals perspective (""Mummy, Mummy, what's that funny smell?"" asked the five-year-old).  Cannabis  should be LEGALLY acceptable, but it is a vice, like alcohol or prostitution.  There's no case for the government to normalise it as MORALLY acceptable.

I did not like Kathleen Wynne's cannabis law, because it would have given even more power to CUPE, an organisation with too much power as is (the situation in Ontario is such that if the CUPE president farts, the Premier farts twice in order not to be seen as giving lukewarm support).  The one good thing about the law was that consumption was permitted in private only.  Premier Ford threw the baby out with the bathwater. 

I am a neoliberal for the most part, but I think with bans on public consumption and grow-at home operations, subject to fines equivalent to a speeding ticket ($250), and backed up by robust enforcement, the provinces of Canada would be well equipped to shrink deficits and service their debts.  On-the-spot fines, though; we wouldn't want to clog up the justice system. 

My idea was inspired by speed limit enforcement: cities set the speed limit at a point very slightly below the observed average or calculated safe speed, so as to maximise ticket revenue without impairing throughput or efficiency.

What do you think, everyone?  Would this be a good way to increase funding for the government?  Perhaps even lower taxes on cannabis or elsewhere?

I'm flying to the U.S. next month for a short trip. I'm a somewhat regular but not heavy cannabis user (2-3 times a week.) I've read some articles about Canadians who have been denied entry to the states for admitting they've smoked week but I don't know if this is indicative of the average experience or just a couple of rare instances.

The canada website is not helpful as it only says: ""Previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean that you are denied entry to the U.S."" Kinda seems like a crap shoot.

I dont work in the cannabis industry. I usually use debit to buy it but I will be leaving my debit card at home and using credit in the states. I also plan to clean my phone of any cannabis references in my texts or messages.

This is also going to be my first time out of the country so going through customs for the first time is kind of compounding on my nervousness about weed.

I guess what I'm asking is, will I get questioned at the border? If i do, should i lie (I'm not a terrific liar?) Can they drug test me? Any other canadians have experiences with this they'd like to share?

I also dont plan on illegally transporting it or seeking out weed once I'm there.

Here's the issue, as of this month (jan 2019) my company (correction, company that holds my companies contract) has finally won the injunction to randomly drug test their employees/contractors. This is a company within the oil sands in Canada.

The thing that really scares me about this, is the power the companies have now gained over my personnel life. When I got this job, which is excellent, we agreed that we would not have illegal drugs in our system, or show up to work intoxicated.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, 1.5 years later, a lot has changed, marijuana is legalized and they are standing strong to their policy on ""drugs and alcohol"" and in fact going one step farther.

&#x200B;

Last week they forced us with under the table threats to sign an agreement to the random drug testing, and now we are being told that if their is pot in our systems we will be reprimanded, and most likely dismissed as I work for a contractor on site.

&#x200B;

I would love to hear some legal advice on how this infringes on my/all Canadians rights.

&#x200B;

The issue I have isnt with the randoms, believe it or not I fully support a drug free and safe work environment, and would in fact, test clean for any drug 100%.

&#x200B;

What really bothers me is now the company and others that will soon follow now have control over what I do in my personnel life and have decided to go with guilty until proven innocent, and are not lying on the burden of proof that states we are in any way intoxicated, instead relying on a test that just proves someone has smoked pot within the last 4-60 days. (mixture of saliva/urine samples) This portion isnt fully released yet , but would really like to know how I can fight this blatant infringement on my right to do what I want on my time off.

Feel free to take this opportunity to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming new year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over Christmas day.  Many of us will find ourselves on home made rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it's a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities!

The Christmas, and the holiday season, is a great time to spend time with friends and family, and I encourage you all to put down the phones, tablets and whatever device you use, and take a break. Even if you are looking at something on r/wholesomememes, the holidays are a great time to take a break from the devices and focus on yourself, friends, and familiy.

While many of us turn our attention towards our families, the Holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many Canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. Some users here may feel alone, or may be in crisis, you are not alone. There are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. If you or someone you love is in crisis, I encourage you to get help. I know it is not easy to take that first step and realize you need help.

For those of you who have served, I encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. If you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, Veterans Affairs maintains a 24/7 line to help those who need mental health support (1-800-268-7708). Recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. You are not alone.

We hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. No matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. Every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. Please do not drink and drive, and if you are going to drink, take a cab or use a designated driver. Services like Operation Red Nose are available across Canada. There is no excuse. It is common sense, but sadly every year hundreds of Canadians lose their lives in fatal accidents where alcohol was involved.

Musings of a 50 year old Canadian, systems analyst, electronics enthusiast, Go playing, pot smoker. 

If it is in fact true and marijuana prices will be at the stratospheric prices as they are now - we have a serious problem. 

If analysts believe this price creep will be absorbed by consumers and will translate to billions of profit to the government and private corporations they will be right - in a small thinking way. The people who are infrequent users of marijuana will purchase from these legitimate suppliers and only them.

Those who smoke marijuana will likely continue to support the underground and this is where our government has been decidedly wrong. 

When large scale movers of black market Marijuana are moving bulk shipments for $1000 to $1500 a pound and the end consumers can and are purchasing high grade 30 year old strains of purple kush for $150.00 an ounce - we have a serious problem indeed.

This legislative and corporate move will not hinder or snuff out, as desired,  It will embolden them. Their market is some x percentage larger now because of legalization the legally regulated, corporate conflated and fattened prices are so high they will continue as they always have these illicit forces. 

It will be even more brutal, more violent, and more money.

Use your heads Canadian legislators. If Consumer prices of marijuana are not reasonably close to what black market prices were and you allow this price creep to continue - it will entrench a new criminal order, as you break one up, and you will have not solved any of the problems of illegal marijuana use at all.

Being able to buy legal marijuana from clean reputable sources is brilliant. These guys won’t be saying, as people can often hear when they visit an illegal source, “Hey want to try a bump of coke?”

Get these prices to fair market trading prices fast or its simply going to be the same old bullshit - except now we will have even more decent people in jail for 14 year prison sentences because $400.00 an ounce for marijuana is just plain silly.

I hope I haven’t offended anyone with my opinion on the status of marijuana legalization in Canada.

We've booked our flight to Vancouver for 23 days from late May to early June. I am looking for any advice whatsoever for this trip!

Normally when I ask these questions I've got a lot more research and preparation done already, but Canada is such a huge country and it's one of my longest trips so I don't really know where to begin. Excuse me for the vague post :D.

Our focus is nature and activities in it (mainly hiking, some kayaking,..) but would also like to see/do anything that, well, we just have to do.

Our initial idea is something along this route: https://tiogatours.be/routeplanner/camper/edit/2715/

At first we really wanted to do some multiple day hikes with a tent, but we're concerned about bears, we've never hiked in an area with bears and thus have zero experience with them. We don't have any equipment for it yet (bear canister, spray,..) but the main problem is mostly fear, we'd probably have a hard time sleeping if we'd hear anything remotely resembling a bear :p. Are multiple day hikes worth getting over this fear and doing more research, or are day hikes plenty to see the 'best' trails/scenes in the area?

For transport we were first thinking about a small campervan with a tent on top, but are now more interested in a nice complete camper. Is a route like we are looking at doable/recommendable with a camper? Are we missing out on some glorious offroading if we do get a camper? And any recommended camper renting companies or camper advice in general? Is it best we go to specific camping sites for our camper, or can we just park and sleep everywhere? (somewhere next to a road in the middle of nature, a big parking lot,...)

I noticed weed is legal now and like the occasionally joint with a scenic view around home, but have never been able to do it while out of country. Are there any specific rules regarding smoking weed in national parks, in or around campsites,... and can we just find a shop in Vancouver which sells to foreigners?

And finally, what are some general tips and recommendations on what to do, what to see, what (or where) to eat, where to do most of our shopping,.. looking for both broad and specific pointers so we can begin to narrow down and start planning the trip.

Thanks a lot!

I have an idea that could be a positive way to fight climate change in the long term while also promoting fiscal responsibility. 

The U.N. has stated that the prime driver of climate change is rampant population growth.

I have a brother in law that has 6 children and he is an accountant.  He has used legal loopholes to maximize his Child Tax Credit payments while earning a very comfortable income.

At the same time, I have witnessed poor families that actually have more children in order to increase income while sacrificing quality of life for their children. One poor family in Peterborough Ontario has 13 kids, and the kids live off of food bank food while the unemployed parents have the latest gadgets and devices, smoke cigarettes and go out clubbing, leaving the older kids to look after the younger kids. Now, the Children's Aid has been involved, but this COULD have been prevented.

We currently have a system that benefits the wealthy, hurts the poor and is detrimental to our family structure and our environment in the long term.

What I propose, is that the government put a limit on the child tax credit at 3 children, while simultaneously increasing the dollar amount paid out for these 3 children.

Now, the numbers elude me as I am but a visionary and not a mathematician, but I guarantee that if the Minister of Finance were to crunch the numbers, we could stop financially rewarding  procreation in Canada while maintaining a level of payment that wouldn't jeopardize Canadian families.

This could curb our own population growth in the long term while fighting poverty and climate change.

Now, I understand that we need population growth to boost GDP, so the other part of this proposal is that the savings found in reorganizing the child tax credit could be used to bring in more productive refugee and immigrant families to take part in the Canadian dream.

Again, I'm not a numbers guy so this would have to be calculated by the Finance Minister, but I think that these changes to the Child Tax Credit system would put Canada at the top of global leaders in the fight against climate change and the fight FOR my children's future.

These are just ideas that greater minds would need to debate and detail but I really believe this would be a step forward.

I have finished high school and am currently living at home with my parents.  
I haven't had much travel expiriance apart from Bali.

I'm afriad that I'll spend too much time and be a little mummies boy, I have little to no friends in this tiny town and need to get out.

Now I'm normally quite conservative with my money and choices.

And I don't intend of traveling, I can have a good time anywhere.

And I wanna move to Canada because they have legalized weed.

Now hear me out.

Of course I don't want to sit at home all day every day and smoke, that I would make me miserable.

But, I am awear that I need to take responsibility, get some direction, make something of myself.

But, since I don't drink it's very hard for me to find friends.

And there is still a fair bit of anxierty around smoking behind my parents back because I love them and they love me just because of my past they think it's no good. 

Were, I think I can enjoy life, smoke worry free (for the most part) make friends, avoid alcahol (I don't like alcahol at all) do something for the greater good, and survive.

Or is moving half way around the world to avoid my family and smoke weed the stupidest thing you've ever read.

Likewise my condo association has passed a bylaw disallowing it’s use (by smoking or vaping) within my condo or anywhere on the property including my balcony. It’s not like I’m going to smoke in my car or workplace either.

As far as I can tell, that leaves precisely nowhere that I could consume, should I be so inclined. Even worse, most landlords are quickly instituting new rules prohibiting it in their rental properties. They can do this retroactive to your lease if they do so within 90 days of legalization. So those who don’t own their own house are being effectively banned from pot use. 

It strikes me that this is going to pretty much make things pretty hard for the exact same part of the population that was most at risk before legalization.

Polls in Canada reveal something interesting about environmental issues. Most Canadians view climate change as a problem and say they want to do something about. At the same time, about as many Canadians oppose carbon prices (carbon taxes) as support them. This may not seem like a paradox, until you realize that policy experts and economists overwhelmingly support a carbon price. I'm not an expert on this topic, but it is an area of interest for me, so I'd like to clear the air on this topic as much as I can (haha, clean the air, get it?). 

Note: A ""carbon price"" as an umbrella term under which a number of schemes, notably carbon-taxation and cap-and-trade fall. At times I may occasionally use ""carbon tax"" and ""carbon price"" interchangeably. 

**What is carbon pricing?**

Carbon pricing is based on the idea of pricing externalities through [Pigouvian taxation](https://www.economist.com/economics-brief/2017/08/19/pigouvian-taxes). There are certain economic activities that affect others than those directly involved in them, without those affects having an impact in the cost. These are called externalities. In the case of **positive** externalities there is a strong argument for subsidization, as these are activities that benefit society. Looking at education, an educated workforce is going to be more productive, make better political decisions, and be more prone to innovation, yet these facts are not directly taken into account in the price of education. This is why education is subsidized, to an extent, in most developed countries. Conversely, there are certain activities that take place to the detriment of those not involved in them, called **negative** externalities. There is a strong case for implementing taxation on these activities. Greenhouse gas emissions are an example of negative externalities, because they [worsen health outcomes](http://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/h) and lead to [anthropogenic climate change](http://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/ipcc/ipcc/resources/pdf/IPCC_SynthesisReport.pdf). Carbon pricing would mean placing a tax on these externalities in order to replicate their true cost to society. This pricing would be an effective way to get rid of these problems, without harming the economy in the way that excessive regulation might. In practice, carbon pricing is implemented through either a carbon tax, or through a cap-and-trade scheme (note: there are costs and benefits to either of these, but this seemed like a needless tangent). In spite this fact, many states have been reluctant to introduce prices on greenhouse gases, either not introducing them, or introducing them despite a considerable amount of opposition. Not only that, but emissions intensive industries are presently [subsidized to the tune of $493 billion in 2014](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28510/wb_report_171027.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y). At present, about 85% of emissions are not covered by a carbon tax. I'm going to be arguing that not only are carbon taxes a great idea, but that this opposition is based virtually entirely on ignorance of how carbon taxes work, or a lack of willingness to do anything about climate change. 

**There is a need for action on climate change**

I would hope that this is something that is already accepted by most readers here, however I unfortunately doubt that this is the case. If you doubt that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity, or that it will have a catastrophic impact on humanity and our way of life, I'd encourage you to read [this section](http://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/topic_futurechanges.php) of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change's fifth report, section 2.3 in particular. Climate change is [already affecting economic growth, and could limit economic growth by as much as 10% by the end of the century, with the harshest impacts hitting already vulnerable populations in areas like sub-Saharan Africa](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/the-economic-consequences-of-climate-change_9789264235410-en#page23). 


 **Carbon pricing works.**

In assessing how to best implement climate policy, there are two major questions: Does the policy reduce GHG emissions? and: Does the policy reduce GHG emissions without seriously hampering the economy? Carbon pricing is an effective policy because it answers both of these questions with an emphatic yes. 

Carbon pricing works on the basis of how prices impact consumer choice, which is a lot.  Analyses of cigarette consumption, for instance, have found that, despite the prevalence of warning labels and limits to cigarette advertising in much of the west, the most effective way to reduce smoking is simply [to tax the product](https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromAug2011/guindon_fig4.gif). The same is true of greenhouse gas products. The higher the price, the less willing people are to consume it. Unlike cigarettes, which have a mixed impact on society, GHG emissions are purely bad for society. Because of this, the lack of a carbon tax can effectively be considered a subsidy. A carbon tax is a way to internalize the price that emissions have on society onto the emitter themself. This is not (or at least, should not) be done all at once, it would immediately put many industries out of business, but is rather done incrementally. Most carbon taxes have tended to start at around $5-10 USD per tonne, going up exponentially over time until the actual cost of carbon is internalized (in effect until emissions are at or near zero). 

How does this pan out in practice? Based on this principle, carbon pricing has been introduced in a number of different jurisdictions around the world, to great effect. Carbon pricing is [widely supported among economists](https://ecofiscal.ca/wayforward/) as a mechanism that is able to lower emissions without hindering economic growth. 

British Columbia was the first province in Canada to introduce a price on carbon, implementing a cabon tax of $10 per tonne in 2008, rising to $30 per tonne in 2012. The result has been a reduction of emissions of between [5 and 15 percent](https://ecofiscal.ca/carbon-pricing-works/#section-3). How has the price affected their economy? Well, it's hard to say how they would be doing withotu the tax, but it is notable that between 2011 and 2015, BC had the [highest labour productivity growth in Canada](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/economy/labour-productivity.aspx) in spite of the fact that they had the most robust carbon pricing system. 

California implemented its AB32 cap-and-trade scheme, [covering 85% of emissions, in 2012 and its economic growth continues to outpace the growth of the rest of the country](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21742.pdf]. What's changed is that it is now on track to meet its 2020 emissions-reduction targets. 

**Revenue Recycling**

Noting the success of carbon pricing in theory, it now becomes very important to discuss the implementation of carbon pricing, as improper implementation can ruin even the best ideas. The most important factor for consideration in administering a carbon price is where the revenue that is generated through the price goes. What many economists like is the idea of a revenue neutral carbon tax. This means that all the revenue that is paid to the government through the tax is paid back to the population. There are a number of mechanisms to accomplish this, such as lowering income taxes or establishing a basic income/negative income tax. 

This type of policy, known as revenue recycling, improve economic efficiency by shifting revenue generation from things that arguably should be taxed (GHG emissions) to things that arguably shouldn't (income). It shouldn't be surprising that survey of American economists shows that 97% (hey, where have i heard that number before?*) of economists surveyed [supported a carbon tax that recycled its revenue through lowering income taxes](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-taxes-ii). What's more is that this type of policy further improves the economic incentive to reduce emissions by directly showing to consumers their incentive to live a more sustainable lifestyle. 

*The 3% of those who didn't were one economist that was ignorant of the science on climate change. 

**Myth and Fact**

I've been promoting carbon pricing on reddit for awhile; accordingly, I've been met with my fair share of opposition. Below are some of the arguments I've encountered, and how well they stand up against the facts. 

>Carbon taxes won't decrease fuel usage, people driving cars are doing so because they have to drive them, and don't have any other option. 

This claim is *false*. BC's carbon price has resulted in both an [increase in more fuel-efficient vehicles, and a drop in gasoline consumption](https://ecofiscal.ca/carbon-pricing-works/#section-3). 

>A carbon tax will hurt the poor the most. 

This claim is *mostly false*. It's true that a carbon tax has the potential to add another economic cost to those who are already potentially in dire straits. But when you consider that [the wealthiest people tend to pollute much more than the poorest](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/1/16718844/green-consumers-climate-change), it can be easy to se why this claim doesn't hold much water. The revenue generated by a carbon tax would be paid largely by the wealthy, while revenue recycling (depending on the method) would allow for revenue to go to all at an equal rate. Effectively, this means that the poorest stand to benefit the most from a carbon tax. If you're truly concerned for the impact of a carbon tax on the poor, push for a revenue neutral carbon tax, not no carbon tax. 

>The effects of climate change have been exaggerated by the scientific community. 

This claim is *false*. In fact the [opposite is true](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22082017/study-confirms-exxon-misled-public-about-climate-change-authors-say).

Because of this it will be inaccurate and run the risk of giving sober people DUIs which could potentially cost them their job.

&#x200B;

Ive read the government justify it by saying that the police officers discretion will be one safe guard against this not working. However im sure as some of you have experienced not all police officers are reasonable people. So room for concern there.

&#x200B;

On top of that they've justified it at least in my province by saying that even if a moderate pot consumer got caught they would likely have 1 to 2 nano grams in their blood which would be a $1000 fine for a first time offense. With a second offense in this THC range resulting in mandatory 30 days jail time. So great im supposed to be okay with this cause ""oh its just a $1000 and 30 days jail no biggie. Not like that would cost me my job and a month of my life or anything.""

Anyone caught at 5 nano grams or more will be subject to all the same penalties as being found extremely drunk behind the wheel.

Those parts have me extremely concerned. Ive had a medical marijuana license for about a year now and like to take a couple puffs after work. Because of this i would likely test positive for thc in my blood at all times. Im completely against driving under the influence however under these new DUI laws I would seemingly test positive for intoxication at all times if a cop gave me a test. So our government is essentially just giving cops the ability to screw you if they think your stoned and youve happened to smoke weed somewhat recently.

&#x200B;

How on earth is this okay?!?!? ""Mandatory 30 days in jail for a second time offense of blood with 1 to 2 nano grams of thc""

Absolutely absurd. Im a completely law abiding citizen and im supposed to accept that i could just potentially be given jail for no reason.

&#x200B;

Everything ive read about this in the US is that tons of cases are just being thrown out in court cause the jury agrees you cant prove the driver was high. So what? Now that weeds legal well occasionally just have sober people potentially be given 30 days in jail cause they like to smoke after work? Or our courts will just be tied up with dumb cases like these?

I have to admit, when I first came across this blog a few weeks ago in my Facebook feed, I thought it was a joke and treated it as such.  But the more I think about it, the more I can appreciate their goals and their reasoning.  The more I think about it, the stranger it seems that its literally illegal to skinnydip.

I really like how they are trying to segregate nudity from sex.  It seems like when people are offended over nudity, its almost always because the offended person thinks sex and nudity are the same thing.

I'm honestly playing with the idea of working up some courage to go join a local nudist club to see what all the fuss is about.  

What does r/Canada think?  Should people be free to skinnydip?  Is it strange that nudity is illegal in almost all situations?  Do you find nudity to be offensive?  Is nudity still illegal because of a vocal minority?  Have I been smoking too much dope and as result am brainfucking a non issue?

I really hope the Calgary Nudists succeed in their mission.  I certainly wont be the first to take my clothes off, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be the last either.

* I hosted two males via AirBnB rental in Edmonton, Alberta a few months ago (Easter long weekend - I was out of town to visit a sick relative).  
* The guests threw a party in my home, and trashed it, causing more than $10,000 of damage.  They put holes in the walls, smoked drugs in the unit, and left drugs and alcohol throughout.
* Based on witness reports, they may have sexually assaulted at least one female on my bed, leaving blood and bodily fluids everywhere.  There were used condoms strewn everywhere.
* Neighbours also witnessed them kicking two females out of the house, late one night/early one morning (3-4 AM) that weekend.  There was yelling and screaming, and they dragged them out of my unit by their hair.  There was women's jewelry and clumps of long hair throughout my home, and high heel marks/chips (from thrashing) on my wall and front door. 
* I came home (after a difficult weekend away - the relative ended up passing away) and reported the incident to AirBnB immediately.  They opened a file.  Not surprisingly, it has been a nightmare dealing with them (upwards of 100 hours of work total - phone, email, personal time sorting receipts, etc.).  Despite having provided evidence for more than $10,000 in damage, they offered me a $2,000 settlement.  I refused to sign that settlement (to try and push for a fairer settlement amount), and ultimately they ended up revoking any payout because I didn't sign by a certain date (because they wouldn't budge on their low-ball offer).  I have received $0.  
* It turns out these two are known to police as members of a gang.  There is now a police file associated with this case, and I have had to meet with police regarding the incident (what happened to the females).  The police visited my home to interview me and see the scene.

**Summary/Questions:**

* This has been a nightmare for me, and I want to share the story to warn others.
* I have contacted AirBnB several times since the final decision, however each time I get elevated after explaining the situation again, I am ultimately ignored.  I have been told my file is closed and they will not return my calls or emails.
* Where do I go from here?  I need the money (I have had to replace my bed and other furniture, repair my home, etc.), however I am concerned that if I hire a lawyer, I will end up owing money (even if I win) due to legal costs.

**TL;DR:**

* Rented out my home while visiting a dying family member during long weekend.  Drugs consumed, home trashed, things stolen, females assaulted, blood and hair everywhere.  AirBnB offering me $0.

I was newly married to a canadian woman. It was totally new experiance to be a landed immigrant and started to adapt and live well in the city. I never knew just how much I liked BC Canada. The health care was great! I loved the people and how they were CIVIL and calm unlike some Americans. I liked the fact it was easy to get around on the sky train and the city buss. I loved the fact that I had a large extended family. I had though a horrid time finding work in information technoligy. I spent years applying to every known company or opening. Zero calls. I had to take a survival job as a security officer. Thank god my wife made a much higher income then me. I survived but never really progressed finaicially. All the wages that I had earned in the fifteen year in BC were 20.00 and under per hour. I had a job that allowed me to drive all over BC Canada. Twice I was flown to remote locations. But the wage issue is a big one. I should have been paid 30.00 a hour. Anyway, my wife filed for divorse on me in 2014 and I left. We were having issues at home. She would would go off on me and yell for pittifull things like ""WHY DID YOU NOT INFORM ME a smoke detector tech was checking our smoke detectors?"" I said I for to tell you. The verbal abuse was getting so bad I had to write a diary of every incident. One one sunday morning, I did not know the wife was trying to awaken me to goto church. I got up late cloths on ran down stairs and wife was leaving for church. I thought she saw me but did not stop. I got in my car arrived in church then asked her ""why did you not stop so I could get into the car? she said she did not see me ""window was large"". She seemed bothered since I asked her in public. The next monday she filed for divorce. She came to me in the living room balling her eyes saying she filed ""she was a credit card addict"" and never EVER regarded me in the decision to add expensive things onto her 20 to 30k in credit card debt ""she had this debt before we were engaged in 2001 and never told anyone"". As a canadian she should have asked for help but two of her weekenses were ""I HATE IT when I am embarrassed and HATE it when I am not in control"" So I had to leave the house. Bounced from one horride house renter to a posh HUGE house only for 500 dollars. I was sad but making money in self employment. In spring of 2016 my self employment wages were falling. I bid on computer networks and the jobs were always given to other people. On top of that, the owner of the house asked all roomates to vacate within two months ""provincial law"". I should have acted faster but was picky. Well the market was and still is in bad shape from a vacancy rate issue. I got down to two weeks and could not find a room to rent. I paniced and then my brother who lives in the states offered a room. I should have NEVER EVER left Canada but I did. It cost me 400 dollars to rent a uhaul and move my stuff from BC to south of Seattle. 

I moved south of seattle. I HATED the idea. I LOVED people for all the things it offered..like cheap health care, goods transportation, kind or nice people. A great police force ""I did some security work and did perimeter security for a police department"". After I moved in I was going though withdraws of a country that had little social safety. my brother was getting impatient with me. I got a job three months latter but my depression and anxiety plus the increased work load got me fired nine months latter. My brother does not care for me. He really does not care much for his family and cares more bout hunting. He even said ""I think all homeless should be buried or shot"" I thought that was the most disturbing thing I ever heard from a individual. The guy also builds assult weapons in his home and sells them to friends ""Its illegal in canada to as much own a gun...which made the country safe!!!!!"". So now its been well over a year unemployed and when I look back, I should have stayed in Canada. Sure, there was no chace EVER to own a house. But the cost of every day items was VERY expensive. I am 52 now. I feel 65 because my depression has made me think suicide is perhaps the only way out. I find that americans JUST do not care that much about each other. Canadians CARE MORE about the welfare of each other. My PR card expired. I have thought about renewing it. I do owe some Canadian tax but at least its not much perhaps a few hundred.

The blackout of the subreddit was something we undertook after considerable reflection, and appreciation of the broader Reddit community. The loss of third-party applications like Apollo and Reddit is Fun will have a negative outcome for many users for a variety of reasons. We are particularly concerned about tools and features that support user accessibility, such as those with vision impairments. For others, the loss of these applications represents a familiar and well-known interface with recognizable features and navigation which is lacking in the current Reddit application. Additional concerns remain about the future of moderation tools, and other features that many subreddits use to enhance their communities. While Reddit has made concessions on some items the apathy from Reddit executives leaves the matter not entirely addressed.

Our participation with thousands of other subreddits made news across Canada and worldwide. It highlighted the impacts of the changes and offered a reminder of what makes the platform unique. However meaningful action has not occurred, and we are still looking for Reddit to address these outstanding issues.

As members of the Reddit Moderation Council and as a Partner Community, we are committed to continuing to engage directly with admins to discuss and emphasize these concerns. We expect Reddit to make good on its commitments to improve accessibility and to engage with honesty and good faith with third-party developers.

**There is still sufficient time for this to be rectified before the proposed changes are implemented, and we will continue to monitor the situation as time passes.**

Thousands of subreddits are continuing to participate in the protest, while some others are not. This continues to be an important issue to ensure accessibility and respect for the users who have made the platform what it is. There is no one size fits all solution and each community and team needs to find their own ways to engage. **We welcome ideas and suggestions from the community in promoting awareness for these issues while balancing the continued desire for many to engage in this community.**

# Updated Content Guidelines
As we reopen the subreddit, we would also like to take this opportunity to share some updates for r/Canada.

## 1. User set Post Flairs

As of right now, Post Flairs are set by Automoderator based on keyword strings, but often require manual updates by moderators for accuracy. In the coming days to allow users and content posters to more accurately represent their content, users will be prompted to select a Post Flair in at the time of submission.  We will be looking to participate in the [Post Guidance pilot](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/149gyrl/announcing_mobile_mod_log_and_the_post_guidance/) which will further support this and other improvements.

## 2. Post Restriction on Opinion/Oped Content

For some time there has been ongoing discussion and comments raised about submission content, specifically opinion articles and related content.  As one of the largest Canadian-themed subreddits we have aimed to allow for broad perspectives and content from mainstream media sources and avoiding fringe or independent media sources. In doing so, we have aimed to promote mainstream content which faces stringent editorial review and follows industry best practices. Like most other discussion-based subreddits, we aim to reduce duplicate posts and avoid individualized stories from dominating the subreddit. The unintended consequence of this has been an overamplification of opinion posts. Many users have raised their frustrations and concerns about this to us, and it has been an issue of significant discussion within the moderation team.

We believe that users here should be able to promote Canadian stories and discuss their experiences and topics that affect them across this broad and diverse nation of ours. As such we are always hesitant to stifle discussion and reduce the opportunities to engage and discuss in good faith. While we want to hope that all here will participate in good faith, we recognize that this is impractical. In order to balance good faith engagement and participation against divisive and bad faith engagement, we will be aiming to introduce an additional change to the content approval process on the subreddit.

In order to target bad faith actors, bots, ban evaders, and reduce duplicate posts, the submission of Opinion/Columnist articles will be limited to accounts with verified emails associated with their account. Opinion submissions submitted from non-verified accounts will be subject to auto-moderator or moderator removal. This will also be a requirement within the comments for these posts as well. This will allow regular and positively engaging users to continue to participate and foster discussions on topics that interest them while targeting bad actors.

We hope this approach when paired with Reddit’s ban evasion and new content filters; will strike a balance between enabling discussion and targeting higher-risk activity. This is not intended to limit ""free speech"" but to ensure engagement comes from engaged individuals who take the time to participate in the community and maintain an account in good standing. We will monitor these changes to see if they are successful and have a positive impact.

## 3. In Comment gifs.

For those of you who use the Reddit app or ""new Reddit"", gify keyboard support is now enabled on the subreddit and supporting gif comments. We will give it a go, in hope that it can lighten the engagement and drive participation.

Please note that the same rules which apply to comments will also apply to the use of gifs

## 4. Publisher-Promoted Content
We have experienced significant outreach from various publishers seeking to post their content directly on the subreddit.

The Liberals banned some 1,500 models and variants of firearms, including the AR-15 and Ruger Mini-14, through an order-in-council in May 2020 on the grounds they have no place in hunting or sport shooting.

Appearing at the House of Commons public safety committee Tuesday, the group PolySeSouvient said a comprehensive ban on all such firearms, including some not covered in 2020, must be built into a bill MPs are studying.

The group wants this “evergreen” measure to be accompanied by new regulations that create a pre-authorization process for models coming onto the market.

The process would ensure that only those guns specifically deemed “non-restricted” or “restricted” and given a Firearm Reference Number by the RCMP would be legal, says PolySeSouvient.

The group includes students and graduates of Montreal’s École Polytechnique, where 14 women were gunned down in 1989 by a man armed with a Ruger Mini-14.

Nathalie Provost, who was shot four times during the spree, told the committee no ordinary citizen should be able to legally possess a firearm that allows them to end several lives in a few seconds, simply by pulling the trigger.

“The combination of bad intentions and the ability to access firearms increases the chances of serious injuries and death,” said Provost, a spokesperson for PolySeSouvient.

Heidi Rathjen, co-ordinator of the group, said during the meeting that including a definition of an assault-style firearm in the bill is important because simply having a list of banned guns requires the government of the day to update the list, a system that has failed in the past.


Rathjen told the MPs that when it comes to a definition, PolySeSouvient would defer to experts who assist the committee, as well as those within government and the RCMP, “to draw the line, which we know won’t be easy.”

“But currently, the orders-in-council, and the little bit of the criteria that’s in there, do not cover all assault weapons, and that needs to change,” she said.

“We’ve been fighting for that for 33 years. And that’s our top priority.”

Sixteen years ago at Dawson College in Montreal, a gunman killed 18-year-old Anastasia De Sousa and wounded 19 others, including Meaghan Hennegan.

Hennegan, a spokesperson for Families of Dawson, told the MPs that some weapons are just too dangerous for private ownership. “We need a comprehensive ban on assault weapons and we need them to be taken out of circulation.”

A buyback program still being planned would require owners of the firearms banned in 2020 to either sell the guns to the government or have them rendered inoperable at federal expense.",canada,Advocates urge MPs to legally enshrine definition of guns banned by Liberals in 2020,0.37,https://www.thestar.com/politics/2022/11/01/advocates-urge-mps-to-enshrine-definition-of-guns-outlawed-by-liberals.html

Police pondered using health officials to relieve ‘pressure’ and ‘passion’ of ‘Freedom Convoy’

High-ranking police officers were strategizing during the “Freedom Convoy” about how engagement with federal officials and having Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam set a timeline for lifting restrictions could help end the occupation.

During the early days of the demonstration, RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki was looking for advice from her senior officers on how to deal with the protesters that had arrived in the nation’s capital, according to recent emails released by the Public Order Emergency Commission.

“It appears the PM is firm on his position not to engage with the protesters or meet their demands,” said Chief Supt. John Brewer in a Feb. 2 email.

“Perhaps a Health Canada official such as Dr. Tam could address the science that Omicron numbers have peaked and set a timeline/date for when the restrictions would be lifted.”

Brewer suggested the health official should make the address in a week or two, so it didn’t look like the government was “appeasing the protesters.” He said the address could “relieve the pressure, and the passion to remain might dwindle.”

Brewer said meetings with government officials can provide an “off ramp” for protesters to leave, but it’s not clear if he meant for a health official to meet with protesters directly.

Lucki responded with praise and said she’d used some of his advice when briefing ministers.

Throughout the three-week occupation, the police were encouraged to engage with protesters.

In a Feb. 11 email, the OPP’s Leslie Jean suggested one deal could be that if the protesters left, then “they will be heard.”

“I think the deal should be something like: ‘You will publicly denounce unlawful activity and blockades and facilitate having individuals being able to return to their homes,’” she said in her email.

“‘If this occurs, you will be able to form a connection with senior government officials, in the form of a meeting, in order to have your voice heard.’”

The email exchange was prompted by a request from Rob Stewart, then deputy minister of public safety, who was seeking consultation on “federal-level engagement with the protesters” so he could provide advice to ministers on the issue.

It led to the creation of an engagement proposal that was circulated among Stewart and the commissioners of the RCMP and OPP, based on the strategy of offering the leader a meeting with a high-ranking official in exchange for leaving the protest and denouncing unlawful activity.

Police were also involved in the deal the city tried to make with protesters to move trucks from residential areas in exchange for items like portable toilets. That deal fell through after the federal government invoked the Emergencies Act on Feb. 14.",canada,Police pondered using health officials to relieve ‘pressure’ and ‘passion’ of ‘Freedom Convoy’,0.68,https://www.ipolitics.ca/news/police-pondered-using-health-officials-to-relieve-pressure-and-passion-of-freedom-convoy

Apparently there is another one on the southern border of Alberta. Honking has ensued nationwide, and news stories continue to develop. [The first megathread has collected news headlines from Jan. 26 to Jan. 31](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/sh8pw2/trucker_convoy_megathread/). This is a megathread continue discussion of convoy news coverage.

**Please discuss and link to new developments here**. New posts to the sub about the truckers will be removed to prevent flooding.

Be civil in your discussions, no matter how hard you disagree. Don't slur, don't rage. Sub rules are still in force and apply to all. Wishing harm/sickness to others, advocating for violence, mudslinging, and namecalling are against the rules no matter how wrong you think your opponent is. Incivility can result in a temporary ban.

Frustrated by the people, politicians, media, honks, etc? *Explain why*. Calling a truck dumb or great is lazy. Explain why the truck is dumb or great. Hell, explain why everything is dumb. We don’t get out of this by raging at our screens. As Canadian Internet melts down in the face of honks, we need to do our best to bring nuance to the table.

Cheers all!

This contrasted with the three consecutive quarterly increases that followed the sharp decline (-11.3%) caused by pandemic-related business shutdowns and travel restrictions in the second quarter of 2020. 

Here are more key highlights: 

* Increases in investment in business inventories, government final consumption expenditures, business investment in machinery and equipment, and investment in new home construction and renovation were not sufficient to offset the declines in exports (-4.0%) and home ownership transfer costs (-17.7%). Home ownership transfer costs include all costs associated with the transfer of a residential asset from one owner to another.
* Real gross national income rose 1.5%, reflecting gains from higher prices of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Final domestic demand edged up 0.2%, continuing the 1.6% rise from the first quarter.

Au deuxième trimestre de 2021, les baisses prononcées des activités de revente de maisons et des exportations ont fait diminuer le produit intérieur brut réel de 0,3 %. La diminution contraste avec les trois augmentations trimestrielles consécutives qui ont suivi un recul marqué (-11,3 %) attribuable aux fermetures d’entreprises et aux restrictions de voyage liées à la pandémie au cours du deuxième trimestre de 2020.

Voici d’autres faits saillants : 

* Les augmentations de l’investissement des entreprises dans les stocks, des dépenses de consommation finale des administrations publiques, de l’investissement des entreprises dans les machines et le matériel et de l’investissement dans la construction de logements neufs et les rénovations n’ont pas suffi à faire contrepoids aux diminutions des exportations (-4,0 %) et des coûts de transfert de propriété (-17,7 %). Les coûts de transfert de propriété comprennent tous les coûts associés au transfert d’un actif résidentiel d’un propriétaire à un autre. 
* Le revenu national brut réel s’est accru de 1,5 %, sous l’effet des hausses attribuables à l’augmentation des prix à l’exportation du pétrole brut et du bitume brut. La demande intérieure finale a enregistré une légère hausse de 0,2 %, qui fait suite à l’augmentation de 1,6 % observée au premier trimestre.

Our news cycle across the country will be dominated by politics. Our social media feeds will be filled politics, streets cluttered with signs, and we will all get our fill of platitudes applying to the next (possibly) 4 years. With the election, it also means for this subreddit the increased likelihood of more political content, more users, more trolls, and more divisive issues being discussed. It is the unfortunate nature of elections.

At this point we felt it was appropriate to remind everyone of a few key points, to try to keep discussion positive and honest.

Please remember that while Reddit is an anonymous message board, when engaging in discussion here you are corresponding with another a human at the other end. Please try to keep things civil as we are all neighbours. The person you are replying to could be on the same bus, share the same job, or live on the same street as you. While elections can be divisive, how we interact with each other does not need to be.

In many countries around the world, especially during election campaigns, groups are talked about in ways that insult their dignity, humanity, and contribute to xenophobia and racism, and much of it is frequently grounded in distortion and misinformation.

> **""We know Canadians value compassion, equality and safety for all. In the upcoming federal election campaign, we call on you to demonstrate your leadership by respecting these principles and speaking out when they are undermined by others[*](https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/politics/canada-s-immigration-minister-wants-to-accept-more-refugees-as-economic-immigrants-1.4475208?cache=?clipId=68597) .""**

Whether it be targeted prejudice against indigenous communities, religious groups, immigrants, members of the LBGTQ+ communities, or any other targeted groups, we ask that you all demonstrate through your words and actions the values that make Canada one of the greatest places in the world to live. **There is a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry, hatred, or prejudice on this subreddit.**

You can disagree with policy, politics, and processes without insulting the dignity and humanity of others. With this in mind, we would ask that if you see comments in this subreddit that break subreddit rules do please report them so that moderators can take appropriate action. Please engage in a respectful dialogue and be mindful of the subreddit rules.

Through the writ period;

**Sub-reddit rules are still in force.** However, posting restrictions on new accounts will be dramatically increased for new accounts created during and just prior to the writ period. The restrictions applied during this period will be continually monitored and adjusted to ensure well intentioned users can still engage while also being proactive to catch trolls, ban evasion, and others with unneighbourly conduct. Please remember while you might be a seasoned aficionado of all thing politics, many new users will be joining us and we want them to get a chance to ask questions and participate in good faith as well.

**Direct post links to political content sponsored by or on behalf of political parties will not be permitted**, except for party platforms which will be included in a combined stickied post as they are released. Content of political releases and other information can be shared through its coverage by the media.

**During the writ period there will be stickied content** that helps provide information informing people how to vote from Elections Canada, as we feel making sure people have his information readily accessible is a benefit to all.

**Discussions which undermine the trust or confidence in the election process or the electoral system, or those that question the integrity of the electoral system without reliable independent evidence, will not be permitted.** This includes, but is not limited to, questioning the validity of voting by mail, the independence of Elections Canada, the use of voting or vote-counting machines to rig elections, and other conspiracy-level denigration of the Canadian electoral system. Elections Canada and elections in Canada are internationally regarded as shining examples of transparent, honest and fair democratic institutions and posts/comments that bring that into question will be removed and further action may be taken.

As a friendly reminder, there will be people who aim to engage in discussions in bad faith. Don’t feed the trolls. **Please report this behaviour so that we can take appropriate actions.**

Through the election period we will continue to review the content that is posted and assess whether megathread posts become required should certain issues warrant broader discussions. This may just be during debates, but we will have to continue to assess as the election unfolds.

Please also note that **opinion pieces** are used extensively by political groups, and should NOT be considered news. While we've allowed them so far, they will always have an ""opinion"" flair/label on them. We recommend placing less faith in these links and stories; every human is biased, but political opinion pieces are by their nature heavily biased and almost never contain the whole context.

Perhaps most importantly of all, **remember to vote!** Take the opportunity now to review what you need to do in order to vote and how you can vote either on Election Day, September 20th 2021, or through the various advance polling opportunities. 

#For more information on how you can vote, please visit Elections Canada’s [Ways to Vote website](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=vote&document=index&lang=e).

Our country is one of the most enduring democracies in the world today. This year, for the 44th time in 154 years, Canadians will choose a new national parliament. While the results on September 20th 2021 may not be the one we as individuals want, we should remember as a former Prime Minister once said in his concession speech; **the people are never wrong**.

Selon les nouvelles données de l’Enquête sur la population active, la croissance de l’emploi s’est poursuivie en juillet 2021 par suite de l’assouplissement des restrictions de santé publique. Voici quelques faits saillants qui rendent compte de la situation du marché du travail au Canada pour la semaine allant du 11 au 17 juillet 2021 :

* L’emploi a progressé de 94 000 (+0,5 %) en juillet, après avoir augmenté de 231 000 (+1,2 %) en juin.
* Parmi les personnes qui étaient en emploi en juin et en juillet, moins de 1 personne sur 160 (0,6 %) a changé d’emploi entre les deux mois.
* Dans l’ensemble, la hausse sur 12 mois du taux d’emploi a été près de trois fois plus importante chez les Canadiens appartenant à des groupes désignés comme minorités visibles (+7,3 points de pourcentage pour atteindre 70,3 %, données non désaisonnalisées) que chez leurs homologues ne s’identifiant pas comme Autochtones et n’appartenant pas à un groupe désigné comme minorité visible (+2,6 points de pourcentage pour atteindre 70,8 %).

Nous venons tout juste de publier les nouvelles données de l’Enquête sur la population active qui rendent compte de la situation du marché du travail pour la semaine allant du 13 au 19 juin 2021.

* L’emploi a augmenté de 231 000 (+1,2 %) en juin, après avoir enregistré une baisse cumulative de 275 000 au cours des deux mois précédents.
* La hausse de l’emploi de juin a porté le secteur des services d’hébergement et de restauration à 21,6 % (-263 000) de son niveau d’emploi observé avant la COVID-19, ce qui représente l’écart le plus faible depuis novembre 2020.
* L’emploi chez les jeunes âgés de 15 à 24 ans a augmenté de 164 000 (+7,1 %) en juin. Il s’agit de la plus forte croissance en un seul mois pour ce groupe d’âge depuis juillet 2020.

my girlfriend and me will be visiting canada for the first time. We rented a Motorhome C19 with Fraserway and will be starting our tour in Calgary.  
So far we do not have a plan except visiting some national parks nearby (Jasper/Banff), Athabasca Falls might be in as well. 

I have a ton of questions which I didn´t find any satisfying answers to, so I´ll just ask right away.

1. Am I allowed to park the RV wherever I want overnight or do we have to be on a campsite?

2. What is the typical cost on groceries and whatnot per week in canada (we´re going to bring around 1500 CAD for 14 days)

3. How long will the battery usually supply us with power if we happen to not find a nearby campsite with power hook ups?

4. Any advice on super cool attractions? We are a lot into nature sights and its beauty! 

5. Where can we set up a campfire and more importantly where not? 

6. What are some have-to-see sights/places in alberta that are not particularly mentioned in the standard guides? 

7. Any other advice, for some 24year old europeans that could help?

&#x200B;

We are pleased to (re)announce that the Globe and Mail's justice and crime reporter Tom Cardoso will be joining us on Wednesday, November 18 at 12 Eastern for an AMA (rescheduled after being bumped by US election coverage). This AMA will be focused on Mr. Cardoso's multi-year investigative work into how ' preliminary assessments in Canada's prisons which showed a system stacked against Black and Indigenous inmates.' Please see below for the announcement drafted by the Globe and Mail:

&#x200B;

>Risk assessments are meant to be an impartial guide of who can be  rehabilitated and how soon, but racialized inmates routinely get the  worst possible scores. They’re steeped in decades of research – and they  are also fundamentally, powerfully biased against Indigenous and Black  inmates, placing them in higher security classifications and assigning  them worse odds of successfully re-entering society.  
>  
>A years-long investigation by The Globe and Mail found:  
>  
>  
>  
>Black men are nearly 24-per-cent more likely than white men to  receive a “maximum” initial security rating, the worst possible score;  
>  
>Indigenous men are roughly 30-per-cent more likely than their white  counterparts to be assigned the worst possible reintegration-potential  score.  
>  
>And relevant links --

All racism is expressly prohibited on this subreddit and will be met with a permanent ban. Anti-indigenous racism makes up the overwhelming majority of such rule-breaking content lately, with negative stereotyping of all indigenous people rampant, whether they are directly involved in these protests or not.

For clarity, the following are (non-exhaustive) examples of posts that will get you permanently banned here. If you wish to express such sentiments, do not participate in this community in the future:

- Permabans for claiming Canada is a 'white nation' and/or solely built by / good because of white people.
- Permabans for anyone claiming Indigenous peoples are in any way inferior to white people or anyone else.
- Permabans and reports to Reddit for any calls for violence (defined as physically-injurious harm), death, or similar harm - including wishing the state inflicts it. For clarity advocacy for ordinary arrest will not be actionable.
- Whatever you think of current treaties or resources provided under them to First Nations, demanding that indigenous people express gratitude or behave in a docile, submissive nature to anyone of a different race due to the fulfillment of these treaties will lead to a permanent ban.

Please report all instances of such racism and do not engage with them. It might feel gratifying to rhetorically fight back against such racism, but it only encourages more of it.

Any and all problems with moderation must be sent to [modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcanada). Racism rules are immutable, however.

It is with pleasure that I would like to announce a unique form of AMA that we will be hosting on the subreddit tomorrow evening (October 21st) currently scheduled to commence at 7pm ET / 4pm PT (subject to change) and with an extended run time of roughly 4-6 hours (also subject to change).

The host of this AMA will be [Jayme Poisson] (https://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/bio/jayme-poisson), journalist and host of the CBC News podcast Front Burner. Joining her will be 4-5 panelists also answering AMA questions. 

The current list of panelists also joining the AMA are:

* Calgary Mayor [Naheed Nenshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naheed_Nenshi)
* Sun News Editor-in-Chief [Mark Towhey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Towhey)
* Political podcaster, writer, and comedian [Ryan McMahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_\(comedian\))
* Criminal defense lawyer [Marie Henein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Henein)

Notably this AMA will be alternating between answering questions on r/Canada and occasional appearances on CBC's televised/web broadcast coverage of election night - be advised you might see some short period where questions go unanswered for a few minutes while they are preparing for going on-air and appearing there.

Final details  somewhat in flux so stay tuned to this announcement which will be updated as new information comes in.

We are extremely grateful to the CBC for their outreach to engage with and inform our community on an unprecedented level this election. The experience has been thoroughly mutually positive and we look forward to a continued cooperative partnership in this area. We are also completely open to any other media organizations who wish to engage with the community in a constructive manner!

We must also give thanks to the admins of Reddit themselves for coordinating these enterprises, as well for general advice and guidance on moderation during this extremely active election period. While we cannot deny the wish for more resources and better tools remains outstanding, we have to acknowledge the effort that has been made to make the subreddit as neutral a ground as possible for discussion between people with differing political views, avoiding a single-sided 'echo chamber', while at the same time completely prohibiting bigotry and hatred.

And finally thank you to our community for being active, interested, and engaged. We ask you to do your best this coming election night (both in this AMA and across the subreddit in general) to be gracious and civil, even over the most heated disagreements, and regardless of the final outcome of the election.",canada,"AMA Announcement: CBC Election Night Extended AMA!

My wife and I are going in vacations in a few weeks through the Maine gates (oouff) by car. I have a NEXUS card, my wife do not, so we can't go through the NEXUS lanes. 

Here's the deal, my dog chewed on my passport yesterday. My photo is intact, but the bio page have a few dents in it, as well as the cover. Since I won't be crossing through the NEXUS lanes, and there's no iris/fingerprint scanners on the regular lanes as far as I remember, I'm a bit worried. I'll have my passport just in case and my NEXUS card, but for NEXUS people crossing with their non-NEXUS partners, how does that usually go? Do you absolutely have to present your passport to the border agent? Can you still just present your NEXUS card? The last few years, airport border agents have been particularly grumpy, and if the trend is similar for land crossing, I don't really want to risk a ban or having my passport confiscated. 

Worst case, in my mind, I'm getting turned at the borders, I lose a few days of non-refundable hotels and we improvise something in new Brunswick/Quebec. Missing them fresh cheese curds in Nova Scotia, WTH regulations prohibits cheese curds on the counter, this authoritarian regime is out of control. I just want to be sure being turned for that would not affect in any way my ability to cross the border as I do it often for conferences and work-related meetings.

>Dear Mr. Richard Gotfried,

>My name is Mackenzie [redacted]. I am 29 years old and I am a born and raised Albertan. I've lived in Alberta for most of my life (over 25 years). I currently reside in your constituency.

>Unfortunately, **I suffer from a relatively rare condition called Meniere's Disease. It's an episodic disorder that greatly impacts my life in many negative ways.** Primarily, I suffer from vertigo episodes which will happen at random. These episodes completely incapacitate me similarly to a seizure, and require an indeterminate amount of recovery time of which I will be bedridden. I've lived with this condition for about 6 years, but **for the last 2 years the frequency and intensity of my episodes have made it nearly impossible for me to achieve gainful employment.** 

>As a result of my medical condition and financial inability to meet my basic needs, **I began to pursue financial support from our government in late 2017**. At that time I was living in Edmonton, so I made a few visits to my local Alberta Supports office to see what my options were. I was informed that **I was ineligible to receive ongoing income support because my spouse was making too much money.** **She was working part time for minimum wage**, bringing in between $1000 and $1100 net pay per month. The cutoff for income support for a family of 2 was just over $950/month at the time.

>We were stuck in a 1 year lease in the cheapest studio apartment we could find, which cost $925/month, leaving us with around $100 to cover all of our other bills and food. This was obviously not anywhere near enough to live on. We were able to receive one-time support for 2 separate months, which did help quite a bit, but we were left on our own for the rest of the time. 

>**I was actively encouraged by Alberta Works staff to apply for the AISH program** due to my dire medical and financial state. I was diagnosed with Meniere's Disease when I was living in BC, and all of the testing to confirm my diagnosis was done out there. For some reason, my family doctor and specialist in Edmonton could not obtain my records from BC, and we had to redo all the testing that I had already done before. I couldn't submit the medical portion of the AISH application until this testing was done. 

>All in, between waiting for appointments with my doctors and waiting for testing, **it took 8 months for me to be able to submit my AISH application.** Upon submission, I was informed that the waiting period to see if I was approved was 6 months. During that time, my lease in Edmonton expired, so I moved to Calgary to share a rental house with my sister to save a bit on rent. 

>**6 months after applying, I received a letter from AISH informing me that I had been denied.** The main reason was the fact that there are potential remedial therapy options that I can pursue. Apparently, one can only obtain support from AISH if there is absolutely no remaining therapy options available. My disease has a few different therapy options, most of which I have been actively following for years to no avail. The other options are either extremely risky or cost-prohibitive. 

>**I planned to appeal the AISH decision**. I had moved to Calgary but was in the middle of a very long waiting period to see my new specialist, so I contacted my Edmonton specialist to get more information about my condition to present to AISH. Apparently he was out of the country for an unspecified amount of time due to a family emergency, so **I missed the 30 day appeal window.** I had to wait another 3 months to see my new Calgary specialist (which was a 6 month total wait), then an additional 3 months for more testing before I could submit more information to AISH. 

>I submitted that information a month ago, and **last week I received another denial letter**. I heard about the Social Benefits Advocacy Program, which deals specifically with AISH, so I gave them a call to get help with a final AISH appeal. **The advocate I spoke to informed me that there was essentially no chance I would ever be approved for AISH**, considering my disability is not consistently detrimental and can potentially get better down the line, even though it is incurable. 

>**I was told that I shouldn't have bothered to apply for AISH in the first place, which is contrary to what the Alberta Supports staff encouraged me to do.** Even if I did appeal and get approved, I would be ineligible for back-pay from the time I applied, because of the fact that I was initially denied and had to appeal. I needed that back-pay to dig myself out of the financial hole I am currently stuck in.

>Applying for EI Sickness benefits was never an option because my work history made me ineligible, since I had been doing independent contractor work on and off for the previous year. CPP Disability has the same medical requirements as AISH, so that won't work either. Obviously I'm ineligible for Alberta Works income support. What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to live?

>**None of this changes the fact that for the majority of the last 2 years I have been bedridden and unable to work.** The only work I've been able to do is as an independent contractor delivery driver with a company called Skip the Dishes. I'm able to do this work because of the extreme scheduling flexibility. I cannot adhere to a set schedule because of the volatility of my episodes, but this position allows me to work whenever I am well enough to. However, this industry is extremely predatory and generally terrible for the workers. After vehicle expenses, I make between $3 and $5 an hour, when I'm actually able to work. 

>**The last 2 years have put me in complete financial ruin.** I have creditors calling me every day. Declaring bankruptcy is likely my only option, and it won't even help me that much. This entire situation has taken a major toll on my mental health. **Honestly, if I didn't have a loving and supportive family, I would be dead right now. I would have killed myself months ago** without a second thought, specifically because of my medical condition and the aforementioned financial ruin.

>**I feel completely abandoned and betrayed by my government.** Canada is supposed to be a haven for excellent healthcare and social welfare, but I have not been able to reap those benefits at all. **I don't understand why a born and raised Canadian in my situation is unable to receive any ongoing financial support from the Canadian Government in a time of need.** I have pursued every avenue available to me and have been ineligible or denied for every program.

>**The waiting times for appointments and testing for someone with a non-life-threatening condition like mine are ridiculously excessive.** **The same could be said about the waiting period for AISH applications. It took over a year and a half of waiting just for me to find out that I shouldn't have bothered to apply for AISH in the first place.**

>I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if there's anything I can do, but I certainly hope my story will resonate with you and potentially inspire change in our broken social welfare and healthcare systems. If you would like more information from me, don't hesitate to contact me by email at this address ([redacted]) or by phone at [redacted]. 

>Thank you for taking the time to read this email.


>Kind regards,

Me and my partner are living are living in Vancouver but are getting sick of how expensive EVERYTHING is, living in shared accommodation, constant construction etc. All the usually Van problems. 

We are doing research on other places to move to in Canada. I grew up in New Brunswick and spent a few years living in Victoria and I can say that smaller cities are definitely more my speed. We are in our mid 30's, thinking about starting a family and want somewhere that is not prohibitively expensive for that.  We are both well-educated people, I have an MA in Education Management and he's got a Business Admin degree and an MA in Marketing. He also speaks 3 languages (Spanish-native speaker, English and Italian). 

We are pretty low-key people. We like going out for a beer, a few small gigs here and there, etc.. nothing OTT. My partner is super into punk so if there is a good punk scene that's a plus. 

We'd be looking for a city which has a good balance of between employment opportunities and cost of living, hopefully with a university or two. I'd say Victoria would be ideal but it's also becoming quite expensive and it's just so complicatedly far from anywhere else.

As relations with China in the wake of the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the behest of the United States are a major ongoing story in Canada this statement is being issued to provide clarity on what you can expect from this subreddit:

* Provided all other rules are followed **no criticism of the government of the People's Republic of China or its leaders, policies, statements, or positions shall be removed.** Moderators will not judge such criticism for fairness or accuracy and this policy does not mean we endorse any such criticism as meeting those criteria - but we also won't be removing it. 
* **Criticism, attacks, prejudice, or negative generalizations towards people solely or primarily because they are of Chinese descent or national origin remains totally prohibited.** This is especially true - but not limited to - when the individuals involved are Canadian citizens. Examples of this behaviour include attributing known issues (such as: that there is a prevalence of academic cheating among some foreign students with Chinese citizenship, that some Chinese nationals are purchasing real estate in Canada with wealth obtained through means that would be fraudulent under Canadian law, etc.) to people based upon nothing more than their Chinese descent or national origin. Such race- or origin-based prejudice has always been and will remain completely prohibited. 
* That does not mean discussion of these issues is off-limits, however, just that such accusations must not be applied to individuals without **direct** evidence of culpability beyond a shared race / national origin. The standard of direct evidence required to accuse any individual of involvement would generally be the charging of such individuals by authorities with such offenses.
* People are entitled to defend the government of the PRC if they so wish but are asked to avoid antagonizing other users or the subreddit as a whole if they wish to do so. Be respectful and civil about it, please, no matter how strongly both sides may disagree with each other.

For clarity this policy is completely identical to the policy for the governments of every country (and persons residing there, living in Canada but of that origin, or descended from persons from there). It's also the policy for Canada itself, all of its provinces, territories, municipalities, and First Nations.

Also to be clear the moderators of this subreddit have not been approached or contacted in any way, shape, or form by Reddit administrators or anyone else in position of authority with regards to anything related to China, nor have we seen any admin intervention in any such topics whatsoever.

We are pleased to present to you an [update to the rules of this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Canada/wiki/rules) based upon feedback from the previous town hall, feedback received in general, and observed patterns of behaviour of subreddit users and Reddit in general. You will find that the rules update follows these general lines, primarily based on what users have asked for:

* **Streamlined Rules:** This update bundles together several old rules into single harmonized rules and better arranges them under relevant categories so you can more easily determine what rule covers what behaviour.
* **Harmonizing Removal Rules, Other Procedures, & Subreddit Rules:** New behaviour patterns have necessitated expanded clarification of the rules with a lot of that detail broken out into their own detailed items. This includes specific rules on people being paid to comment on Reddit, rules on petitions/surveys/fundraisers, rules on paywalls, repetitive info requests (citizenship, phone plans, etc.), and rules about major event 'megathreads.' These are now spelled out in subreddit rules to give users a clearer sense of how the subreddit will be moderated.
* **Increased Detail and Examples With Regards to Rules:** Users have long asked for additional clarity beyond the simple bullet points in the old rules so we have greatly expanded the narrative going with most rules in this update. While perfect black-and-white rules are not possible in a complex social environment like Reddit (and judgment will always be an element in enforcing them, same as any other social ruleset by humans for humans) this expanded detail should give greatly increased clarity as to subreddit policy. Additionally we have added examples at the end of the rules as to frequently-witnessed behaviour that either often gets users into trouble or behaviour that is totally acceptable but is frequently reported.

With those in mind this is the general philosophy of the subreddit:

* Peace, Order, and Good Governance: **Total prohibition on hatred/prejudice \*towards human beings**, enforcement of civility, no trolling/flamebait, a requirement for submission content to be unique, recent, and relevant to Canada on a national scale, and for comments to be generally relevant to the story/topic at hand. Moderation cannot arbitrate truth and will not ensure supremacy of any one narrative over the others - it will simply strive to ensure all subreddit rules are followed. As our sidebar says 'be excellent to one another'!
* Encouragement of more non-political content. r/Canada is a nation-themed subreddit, not a political one. Political discussion is a major facet of any nation and so it is welcome - but it is certainly not all that Canada is about.
* A higher standard of enforcement on post submissions than on comment submissions (due to visibility/crowding out other content) and a higher standard of enforcement on 'serious' stories than lighter ones (due to increased consequences for serious stories).

One point, however, stands out as a major focus for 2019 and beyond that merits its own discussion: r/Canada *is now and forever shall be a bilingual subreddit.*

This year will see increasing efforts to grow the presence of French on the subreddit and foster a more welcoming environment for Francophones. While moderators remain neutral on discussion of the merits of official bilingualism as national policy hatred for people based upon the language they speak will be strictly moderated, as it will when based on province of residence (not exclusive to Quebec but primarily impacting people from that province). I realize the irony of making this pronouncement in a unilingual post but we are at the early stages of this initiative which we hope to bear fruit throughout the year. We have begun soliciting outside help with this but in the interim will still try to be as welcoming of Canada-related content in French as possible. Articles in French as well as comments in French in any post are encouraged so long as they follow all subreddit rules. We recognize that the majority of r/Canada users are currently unilingual Anglophones (who will both dominate the subreddit with English postings and may react negatively to any story covered solely in French) and so an exception to the duplicate post rules has been explicitly added to the rules to benefit both Anglophones AND Francophones: **coverage of any news item posted in one official language may also be posted in the other.**

While the underlying philosophies of the subreddit are fairly solid no rule is set in stone. We welcome discussion and feedback on them below as well as any other civil, constructive commentary on the subreddit in general.

Some fun statistics, a bit shorter than [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/9obwss/rcanada_moderation_report_town_hall/), to illustrate the growth and activity on our subreddit:

* If our subreddit were a Canadian city our 450,000 subscribers would give us a population closing in on the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario. That's good enough to make us the 11th biggest city in Canada, just ahead of London, Ontario (excluding the metro area)!
* The subscriber count for r/Canada is 1.225% of Statistics Canada's most recent population estimate for the country (2017) - although naturally not all subscribers are necessarily Canadian citizens or live in Canada.
* In the 95 days since the last town hall we've gained about 39,000 subscribers. That's an annualized growth rate of \~155,000 people! The rate of growth is also increasing but if we were to hold the current growth rate stable the by the 2023 election comes around we will be well over 1 million users.
* The 3 months has increased our rolling 12 months comments to 2.4 million. That's 2/3rds the comments received by the CBC in the last year reported (2013).
* Pageviews have also jumped to an annualized 142.8 million per year with 17.8 million unique visitors - just over half the traffic experienced by the Toronto Star!

Edit: since some have asked for it: [here is the modlog summary for October 20-January 18](https://i.imgur.com/d5942mk.png) (the maximum Reddit allows for). Some notes on moderation trends since the last town hall:

* 6% fewer mod actions than the 58-day period last time (July 6 - October 14 2018 vs. October 20 2018 - January 18 2019)
* 39% fewer bans
* 24% fewer posts removed as spam
* 38% more posts removed for other reasons
* 70% fewer comments removed as spam
* 3% fewer comments removed for other reasons
* 2% fewer reports
* 25% of reports (posts or comments) resulted in no action (approval of post or comment)

While based in Ukraine, I reported on the war in Ukraine, Canada's role in providing support, both [military](https://thewalrus.ca/ukraines-mine-field/) and [charitable](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-orphans-summer-camp-/27215662.html), and other things like \[corruption in Ukrainian politics\]([https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-roman-nasirov-1.4012211](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-roman-nasirov-1.4012211)), [cyberattacks launched by the Russians](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170704-the-day-a-mysterious-cyber-attack-crippled-ukraine) and I also went to Chernobyl too many times to be comfortable with.

We were supposed to go on a flight but that didn't happen, and after seeing the crew compartment, I was happy it didn't.

But I also got the chance to branch out, (some call it 'parachute in') to [cover conflict in Venezuela](https://longreads.com/2017/09/28/venezuela-caracas-constituyente-protests/), political unrest in Poland, and did some work across Europe, Asia and some interesting shit in the U.S for the BBC about cybersecurity, and weirdly, [the future of trucking](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171025-do-driverless-trucks-signal-the-end-of-an-american-era). I had the good fortune of spending my 31st birthday at a truck stop diner somewhere outside Sacramento for that one.

So why weed?

Well my parents both immigrated to Canada from Poland in the late 80's and to them, weed was always like the worst thing on earth. Obviously growing up as a Canadian kid, you come to see it as completely normal but when I came back to Toronto earlier this year because (very humble brag) I made a film for the CBC called [VIKA](https://www.cbc.ca/shortdocs/shorts/vika) and it got accepted to Hot Docs where it had its world premiere and we got Vika a visa to visit for the premiere to reunite with her sister, and took runner up for best Canadian short.

Anyways, while I was back, I saw all the dispensaries, all the talk about legalization and honestly didn't really understand what was happening, but I just figured, imagine if you could go back in time and cover the end of prohibition, obviously that would be incredibly cool, but this is even more interesting because there's the opportunity to see the rollout of this whole new industry, not only in Canada, but around the world. And that means I'd like to stretch this into looking at the EU as well, especially Poland, because eastern europeans in general are so against weed that it'll be fascinating to see the destigmatization of it in places I never imagined it'd become acceptable.

Most companies won't touch me because I don't have an NB licence. I have both an Australian and International Driving Permit, and was naively under the impression this would be enough.

I can't get an NB licence because I'm not in possession of bills with my name on them here because I'm a tourist that has been here only a few days.

The cheapest quote I've had was $3500 (on a car purchased for $1500). 

Did I fuck myself massively? Is it really that prohibitive being from overseas and purchasing/insuring a vehicle in NB?

* They state they are allowed to add rules to the lease agreement retroactively

* Effective July 1st we cannot ""engage in the cultivation or growing of Cannabis in the rented premises"", violation of this is basis to be evicted

* They say even if cultivation and growth is deemed necessary for a tenant, that it still cannot be done on our premises

* They list ""mold growth, excessive electricity consumption, fire risks and security issues"" as reasons for the new rule

* Any damage caused by cannabis growth will be charged to the tenant

* If proven cannabis was grown in your apartment you will be charged for excessive hydro (assuming hydro is included in your rent)

* At no point do they discuss the legalization of Cannabis for recreational use on October 17 (though this is clearly in response to it)

So obviously they can enforce these rules now, because cannabis growth is currently illegal. My question is how legal is this prohibition after Oct. 17 (once you're able to legally grow up to 4 plants)

What happens to the people who are caught with cannabis until then? Until the coming into force date in 2-3 months,  cannabis is still illegal, and people can therefore still be charged with this absurd crime. What a time we live in to experience the final days of prohibition, and without a doubt for these next 2-3 months people are going to be charged with possession of cannabis. We are going to experience some of the most absurd, illogical enforcement of the law we have ever seen. We know it might as well be fully legal TODAY now that the Senate has approved, and all that stands in our way is a measly 2-3 months. But within those 2-3 months we are going to experience the epitome of ""rules because the rules say so"". Pardons are eventually going to be issued for past cannabis crimes, and despite that our justice system is going to continue charging people.

This is a fascinating time to experience, and it's a time none of us should forget. We get to experience the final days of a law that, particularly in the US, was used to target racial groups. Never forget that a government can be this illogical, because it can happen again. Legalization of cannabis stands as a monument to reason and logic in our government, but always remember the fight it took to get here. Right now in the US, we see what is hopefully a brief return to populist fascism. We must recognize that we can fall prey to that same fate if we are not vigilant. Maybe not in 10 years, maybe not in 50 years, but if we do not remember the mistakes of our past the cliche goes, we will repeat them. Remember this day, the day reason triumphed while our neighbors to the south built cages for children. Do not think the fight for reason is over. It is an ever present battle that we must continue fighting as hard as we can for the rest of our lives.

This bill will create the condition for citizens who want to keep their rights, become apprehensive of seeing mental health services. The people who need help the most will have to weigh their future rights and liberties against taking the voluntary action of seeking help. This new obstacle will tilt the needle of choice even more towards an individual choosing to deal with their afflictions on their own rather than seeking help.

This is a bill that proposes to have us, Canadian citizens, sacrifice our future liberty in order to use mental health services; a service our tax dollars pay for. It is an absolute disservice to Canadian rights and liberty by making citizens who seek help have less rights than others.

Industry standard already sees all firearm buyers present their PAL/RPAL (Possession and Acquisition Licence). Currently, restricted firearm purchases require a few extra steps. The seller would call and verify the buyers license, be issued a reference number, which the buyer will then call in with the two to verify transfer, then the transfer begins. In lucky provinces this process takes an hours, in less lucky provinces this process take weeks.

An example of a restricted firearm is a pistol.

Examples of non-restricted firearms include bolt action, pump action, or semi-automatic rifles.

An example of a prohibited device is a fully automatic rifle or a center-fire magazine with a capacity over 5 rounds, both punishable with up to 10 years in prison.

Also, many non-restricted type firearms are categorized into the restricted category solely based on their name. They function identical to every other non-restricted firearm but they are classified as ""restricted"". Restricted firearms may only be used on designated ranges for restricted firearms. Each restricted firearm requires a registration certificate and Authorization to Transport which has to be issued by the Chief Firearms Officer (CFO) of one's provincial or territorial jurisdiction in order to transport a restricted firearm from one location to another. ^^http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/restr-eng.htm

This bill requires every firearm transaction that occurs to request a reference number for that transaction which links to the involved citizens' R/PAL licences (which includes name, address, etc.).

This reference number is to be provided by a registry. This registry has the authority to approve or deny any request for firearm transfer on every legal transaction. The request for this number must be approved and provided from the registry before any transaction can take place. This bill does not include any additional funds in order to compensate for this workload. The last time something like this was tried, it cost Canadian taxpayers over 2 billion dollars on a system that served 18,500 inquiries per day. It is often argued and shown with statistics that the Firearm registry had zero positive impact on criminal behavior. Between its proven ineffectiveness and its immense cost to the taxpayer it was rightfully discontinued as a deficient government program.

The incredible workload this legislation expects to happen for free will create a backlog of reference number requests. Firearm purchases and transfers will require weeks, months, or longer to process this reference number. If this process is fully automated with no support staff, what will be of the situation for Citizens who have valid licences but get denied their reference numbers without reason? What will be of the Citizens who have valid licencing but do not get served their reference numbers at all? This will cause an absolute collapse of every law abiding Canadian's civil liberty.

This legislation also relieves the government from being a regulating body on the RCMP (a contracted entity) in matters of firearm law interpretation and enforcement. The RCMP will be allowed to interpret firearm legislation and enforce firearm legislation on their own accord without any overseeing body to answer to, thus removing protections citizens currently have from overreach.

There is nothing in this bill that targets the problems we have with gun violence or gun crime. Everything in this bill is directed towards law abiding citizens.

>This bill should be cut to one line. As it is the only argument for this bill to be pushed. It is as follows.

>>Firearm transfers must be conducted to transferees who posses a valid licence or certificate.

Basically the lawsuit attacks three points of the Canadian health system :

* The prohibition of duplicative private insurance (private health insurance cannot be offered for services covered by public health insurance)
* The prohibition of dual practive (medical staff cannot work both for public and private health care, they need to decide which sphere to work in)
* The capping of private medical fees to public fees (Private practice cannot charge more than what the public practice is charging for a same service)

The (very simplified) argument of Brian Day for removing these provisions is that it would change our current system to be closer to the European model. His entire argument is available [here on his website](http://www.brianday.ca/).

On the opposite side, the argument is that removing these points would bring Canada's health care closer to what the American system offers, where the wealthy would be able to pay for high insurance premiums and skip the wait, while the less fortunate wait in the public system (Best website I found for this side is [BC Health Coalition's](http://savemedicare-bchealthcoalition.nationbuilder.com/) website, you can also read their opening statement for the lawsuit [here](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/bchealthcoalition/pages/20/attachments/original/1473869168/2016_09_14_Coalition_Intervenors'_Opening_Statement.pdf?1473869168)) ",canada,"BC Supreme Court battle to change Canadian health care to resume this Monday, April 9th (Brian Day VS British Columbia)",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/8aakrh/bc_supreme_court_battle_to_change_canadian_health/

I unfortunately had to add my opinions and comments which may seem partisan which is why I clearly labeled which is part is the facts and which is my own interpretation and comments. 

This isn’t as fully researched as my last piece [the summary on gun controls in Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/827k8i/a_summary_of_the_canadian_gun_control_system/) as the government is pushing C-71 through pretty fast. It has already passed second reading and is going to the public safety committee to tweak, with not much debate or comments actually happening by other MP’s which had barely a week to read and research the bill. 

This will hopefully be an educational piece to help people understand what C-71 does. 

Reminder: I'm just a layperson, and not a lawyer so my impressions/interpretation on legislation may not be correct. 

So first I would link you to the legislation as proposed by the liberals in [Bill C-71](http://www.parl.ca/Content/Bills/421/Government/C-71/C-71_1/C-71_1.PDF) it’s a little hard to read because it talks about passages being added or removed without context. 

CCFR made 2 documents that helpfully slot in the passages to be added and removed.

**Firearms act changes**

**Criteria background checks**

Mandates that the Chief Firearms Officer (CFO) or provincial judge (who hears appeals of CFO decisions) must consider the lifetime history of an applicant for a firearms license instead of the previous 5 years.

**My comments:** Currently the CFO is not limited to just the previous 5 years of an applicant, they can research back further to even the lifetime history of an applicant. (Firearms act s.55 (1)(2) Further Information and Investigation) I don’t think there is anything truly problematic with strict background checks, but I think if we require them the CFO should have more funding to actually conduct through background checks

**Transfers of non-restricted firearms**

When transferring a non-restricted firearm (which are typically long guns, no handguns), for private sales the seller needs to apply to the Registrar of firearms (the Canadian firearms program (CFP)) with the license information of the buyer, which is then verified to be valid and is issued a transfer number denoting a valid verification.

The registrar can refuse the transfer and may inform the seller why it was refused.

Removed the previous wording of non-restricted firearm transfers, and made it so non-restricted transfer requests are can be recorded.

**My comments:** It was never legal to sell/transfer a firearm to a person not permitted to possess one. No matter when the news outlets say “a buyer does not need a PAL” it is semantics. The criminal code sections are s. 99 Weapons trafficking, and s. 101 transfer without authority if someone transfers a firearm to someone not authorized to possess one. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46) If a seller transferred a firearm to someone not permitted to possess one they are breaking the law, and the buyer is too for possessing a firearm without a license. 

This just adds in an extra step to transferring a non-restricted firearm as someone needs to call in to the CFP to confirm any transfer. The CFP is currently only open from 8am to 5pm on business days, they are typically closed on the weekend and holidays, which makes it hard for people to call in during regular working hours.

My personal experience is it took me up to 30 minutes to validate a license, mostly from being on hold to call in and validate an internet sale. I suspect if this bill passes transfers/sales will grind down to a halt as by the wording of the law you can’t even transfer a non-restricted firearm if you have someone’s license in front of you as you need to call in for a transfer number first. My opposition to it is that it overloads the duties and workload of the registrar and the CFO making it harder for them to carry out their other responsibilities, which are more important then verifying peoples licenses for non-restricted firearms. 

**Revocation of license**
Transferring a non-restricted firearm not as is prescribed previously in section 23 can result in the revocation of your license by the CFO. 
It would be mandatory to call the registrar anytime, someone sells, barters or gives a non-restricted firearm to anyone. 

My comments: I can not transfer a non-restricted firearm to someone even if I have their firearms license in front of me. I must call in to confirm that it is a valid license. A license that if it has been revoked should have been taken away by the police. 


&nbsp;

**Prohibited firearms**

Prescribed the CZ 858 and SAN Green/black rifles to be prohibited firearms to be grandfathered to current owners that register them before June 30, 2018. The non-restricted versions that are currently not registered, have 1 year after the commencement date of the bill to register them.
These firearms are treated like prohibited firearms in that an ATT is required to transport them. This means a non-restricted SAN or CZ 858 can not be brought out to crown land or stored anywhere else but your house. The automatic ATT would only cover storage at your address and require an ATT to go to a gun range. They could also have their ATT’s permanently revoked in the future which is what happened to the other prohibited firearms around the 2000’s that have ATT’s that allow them to go to gunsmiths, gun shows, the border but never to a shooting range by legislation.  (Firearms act s.19 (2) Exception for prohibited firearms other than prohibited handguns)


**My comments:** Background information about the CZ 858 and SAN rifles
I would like to lay out the basics on the prohibition of the CZ 858 and SAN rifles. Because some people mix up the reasons for the classification. 

**CZ 858**

The CZ 858 was inspected and imported into Canada then classified as non-restricted/restricted depending on length, it is not at all related to the AK series of rifles (which are prohibited) besides the cartridge and similar shape, no parts on a VZ 58 can interchange with an AK. 

Sometime later after thousands were imported, CZUB (the manufacturer) substituted surplus receivers that were manufactured for the military but not finished, notably it had the cutouts necessary for the installation of full auto parts but was never finished as full auto firearms because the cutouts were welded closed. But the existence of the cutouts and the subsequent welds to close it up made certain CZ 858’s imported after 2007 classified as converted auto firearms which are prohibited firearms. The FRT entry also says that the CZ 858 could be “converted in a short period of time with relative ease to full auto”. The RCMP prohibited all the CZ 858’s declaring all models converted autos and ordering the owners to turn them in for destruction without compensation.

Addendum: It was never a blanket ban on the VZ 58 series of rifles, just the ones made by CZUB. The CSA VZ 58 rifles were always made for the civilian market with new receivers just for civilians.

**SAN Rifles**

The SAN rifles were inspected and imported into Canada then classified as non-restricted/restricted depending on length. It was declared at their import/inspection they were descendants of the SIG 540 rifle, the precursor to the SIG 550. The SIG 550 and its variants are named as prohibited firearms but not the SIG 540. Sometime later a reinspection occurred after complaints of someone importing a converted auto rifle. The reinspection determined that the SAN rifles were not a SIG 540 variant, but a SIG 550 variant thus making them prohibited firearms. The RCMP ordered the owners to turn them in for destruction without compensation.  

Addendum: The Chilean FAMAE SIG 540 series of rifles would not be prohibited as the rifles made in Chile were licensed back in the 70’s when the Swiss only sold the manufacturing rights for SIG 540 models. They can no way be linked to the SIG 550 development and be considered a variant. 

&nbsp;

**Grandfathered individuals 12 (9)**

I interpret this section to mean that if the RCMP makes a mistake in classifying a firearm like the CZ 858 or SAN rifles to non-restricted/restricted and then prohibiting them in the future it would be automatically grandfathered. This addition would automatically grandfather prohibited firearms, where if you own one and register it by a certain time you can keep it. s. 12 (8) while similar in wording is only applicable for firearms prescribed to be prohibited by the government, s. 12 (9) seems to apply for firearms classified by the RCMP.

**My comments:** Cynical readers can interpret this section for if the RCMP interprets a currently legal firearm to be prohibited they get instantly grandfathered. This drops the political hot potato of the RCMP making a mistake on a firearms classification, to determine should the government compensate owners for the RCMP mistake, order destruction without compensation or grandfather them. This could make it easier for the RCMP to classify firearms as prohibited, which if passed in conjunction with the removal of criminal code section 117.15 (3) (4) has no government oversight for mistakes or corrections.

**Authorization to Transport (ATT)**

Revokes all the ATT’s currently issued and reissues them with new conditions.
Currently if you have a handgun and are a target shooter at an approved range, you were automatically granted an ATT that put conditions onto your license that allows you to go to any approved gun range in your province, any gunsmith authorized to repair it, a peace officer/firearms officer, a gun show, or a port of exit/entry.

Collectors were given automatic authorization to go to the same locations except a gun range. 

The new conditions as written for a target shooter, you are automatically granted an automatic ATT to and from a gun range, and from the store/location you purchased it from to home.  If you want to go to a gunsmith, gun show, peace/firearms officer, port of exit/entry, you need to apply for a short term/long term ATT from the CFO. 

Collectors have all their conditions for ATT revoked (which were travel to any gunsmith authorized to repair it, a peace officer/firearms officer, a gun show, or a port of exit/entry) and now have to apply for an ATT to go anywhere.

**My comments:** It’s stupid to have ATT’s but C-42’s conditions made the most sense, normal places were automatically granted (gun range, gun show, gunsmith, border, peace officer) while unusual places/cases had to be manually granted (traveling between provinces, borrowing firearms, out door photoshoots etc.) One silver lining is that it codifies into law that you don't need a ATT to transport a newly acquired restricted firearm from the place of acquisition to home, (which could be anywhere, a store, a mail office, the previous owners house etc.) as currently you legally need to apply for an ATT to bring it from a store/mail office to home. 

I personally think this tinkering is to try and fulfill their promise of rolling back C-42. When C-42's ATT's actually made a lot of sense. The paper permit that was removed with C-42, added electronic conditions on your license to transport your firearms, which made for less paperwork that had to be sent out or updated constantly. C-42’s changes to the ATT is even stricter, as some of the old paper ATT's allowed you to borrow and transport restricted firearms that you have the registration certificates for. The current electronic ATT only covers firearms registered in your name, transporting a borrowed restricted firearm requires you to apply for a different ATT.

It is still a criminal offense to possess a firearm in an unauthorized location, like having a restricted firearm at a mall, park, or hockey arena is illegal (Criminal Code s. 93 possession at an unauthorized place). Breaching your license conditions (which the ATT is one of them) can result into the revocation of your PAL.

&nbsp;

**Businesses recording information**

A business that sells firearms, must for non-restricted firearms keep a record for 20 years or longer if prescribed. The reference number of the transfer, the day it was issued, the buyers license, and the make, model, type and serial number of the firearm. 

If the business goes out of business, they must transfer the records to a prescribed official most probably the registrar. 

**My comments:** This was the law back in 1977 after bill C-51 and the introduction of the Firearms Acquisition Certificates, businesses had to record the details of the FAC and the details of the firearm sold. It was repealed when the LGR was introduced as the government was going to keep the firearm records and the businesses no longer had to. Businesses currently have online access to the registrar database and can validate licenses without needing to call in and confirm with the registrar. But the wording of the new transfer provisions seems to make it necessary for a registrar to confirm a valid license and issue a number. This seems to require a human step to properly issue a number, when right now the registrar staff is only available 8 to 5 on weekdays for phone calls. 

The government also states that these records are to only be accessed with a judicial warrant when in fact they can be accessed under s. 102 Inspections under the Firearms Act which does not require a warrant for inspecting a business. An inspector (appointed by the CFO of the province) may inspect the place of a firearms business at any reasonable time, on any reasonable grounds to enforce the Firearms Act. This can include allowing the inspector to search and copy records relating to the enforcement of the act. The record book of transfers of the non-restricted firearms would be part of the Firearms Act and thus can be inspected/copied for enforcing it.

This is one reason there are comments on a backdoor registry where it is now maintained by the businesses and can be accessed whenever by a firearms officer/inspector.

&nbsp;

**Criminal code**

**Forfeiture**

This one is unfortunately very legal, and I would rather not comment on it unless I am certain of what it means. 

The new wording adds surrendering items from a prohibition order to a peace officer also turns the forfeited items into the governments property. 

&nbsp;

**Subsections 117.15(3) and (4) of the Act are repealed.**

This is to be read in conjunction with the criminal code 117.15 (1) (2), where currently if a firearm is prescribed to be non-restricted it can’t be restricted/prohibited and if a firearm is prescribed to be restricted it cannot be prohibited.  

C-71 removes those sections, so the government can’t prescribe firearms to be non-restricted/restricted, and if prescribed restricted can not be classified as prohibited. The government can still prescribe something to be prohibited, or restricted if it has no reasonable use for hunting/sporting purpose under 117.15 (2). 

**My comments:** The Governments stated goal is to remove political partisan politics from classifying firearms. By symbolically giving up the power of classifying non-restricted firearms, while curiously still allowing them to override the RCMP on non-restricted firearms and being able making them prohibited/restricted. (Criminal code s. 117.15 (2)). I disagree strongly with this part because the government is the ultimate arbiter of the law being the legislative branch. If the RCMP makes a mistake or decides to classify firearms only to be restricted/prohibited, the government can’t correct mistakes made by the police and gives them enormous power over this part of the law. The RCMP is unique in their role of defining/interpretation firearm laws that can create a criminal over night. Such as the CZ 858, or SAN rifles prohibitions where one day you were a law-abiding citizen and the next day you were facing a 5 year indictable offense for possessing a prohibited firearm without a prohibited license unless you surrendered it. Matters of this magnitude (instant criminals) should require government oversight on a case by case basis to ensure the RCMP is following the proper procedures and to ensure that the law abiding citizen is not-unfairly treated.  

At the very least its hypocritical as I don’t see the government rescinding their previous firearm prohibition orders, or section 117.15 (2) in the Criminal code where the government can still prescribe certain firearms to be prohibited/restricted. Those older OIC prohibited firearms were purely classified by the government, which funnily enough include a G11 prototype military rifle that was never actually produced (if it was to actually be produced and classified by the RCMP it would have been prohibited for being a full auto firearm). 


**Conclusion:** I think this bill is kind of poorly thought out, the background check part is the only good part of this bill. But everything else just seems to be trying to tinker with the firearms act just to say you tightened gun control. 

EDIT: Conclusion added

EDIT2: Transfer non-restricted wording updated

I am coming to the close of my first extended trip outside the country. Previous weekend trips were made either a decade ago, or with little to nothing to declare.

I have spent the past 86 days in Japan. I will be leaving in approximately 40 hours. I have tallied the entire value of my goods and come up shy of the $800 limit. I have no prohibited or special import items (It's mostly books, honestly.)

What I don't have, however, is *receipts*. Doing a last minute check of customs regulations, I'm seeing more and more that it's strongly recommended if not required to have all receipts in order when approaching a customs agent, and the wording seems to suggest it is absolutely required for secondary inspection.

More than half of my purchases were made at vendor stalls where I wasn't given one to begin with.  The other half, I stupidly did not realize I would be required to keep them and got rid of them when clearing out my room here. I *do* have a couple for big expensive items.

How big of an issue will this be? *The vast majority of my items have the prices written directly on them,* should they need to be verified. A suitcase, 2 articles of clothing, and some kit kats are the only things that fail both receipt and price written on them. I am willing to pay extra taxes and duty if need be, it will not be a large hit to me.

I am more worried about being detained for hours in a secondary inspection process, or having my items permanently seized. I have also seen horror stories and lawsuits of people attempting to bring in comics and books from Japan (Though *nothing* I have is even *remotely* adult material. It's mostly children's stuff that I can practice Japanese with.) 

I realize these are silly questions, but as much as I hate to admit, I have anxiety issues when it comes to law enforcement interactions, and just knowing how fucked I am or am not would help ease that.

The current Canadian gun control system (2018).

I thought I would write this post to help educate people about the gun control system we have in Canada, this is just a basic overview as there are many little details that would require separate posts to address. 

I think most Canadians aren’t aware of the controls on firearms in Canada and sometimes think we are like the US and nonsensically call for more gun control. We have a strong gun control system in Canada which may need some small changes or improvements but is effective in several ways already. I highly suggest people read the current laws on firearms in Canada, in this post I’ll be summing up the various laws/regulations to make it more digestible so I will be skipping over any grey areas and weird aspects.

[Criminal Code Part 3 **Firearms and other weapons**]( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-19.html#h-37)

[Firearms Act; and its subsequent regulations.]( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11.6/) 

Gun control in Canada is achieved mostly by controlling who can possess firearms via the Possession and Acquisition License (PAL).

There are 3 categories of firearms in Canada, Prohibited, restricted and non-restricted. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s.84 (1) Definitions) Very few civilians are allowed Prohibited licenses for prohibited firearms.

**Prohibited firearms:** are any firearms named to be prohibited, any handguns that fire .25/.32 caliber bullets, any handgun with a barrel length less than 105 mm, any firearms that has been sawed down, any firearm that is capable of Full auto, and any firearm that was permanently converted from full auto to semi-auto only. All Prohibited firearms are registered

**Restricted firearms** are any handguns that is not prohibited, i.e their barrel must be longer than 105 mm and it must not fire .25/.32 caliber bullets, any firearm that can fired when it is shorter than 660 mm (short firearms), any semi-auto, center fire rifle/shotgun with a barrel length less than 470 mm, and any firearm named to be restricted. This includes all AR-15 models and variants. All restricted firearms are registered.

**Non-restricted firearms** are any firearms not prohibited or restricted. These are typically rifles and shotguns that are so called “long guns” Non-restricted firearms are not registered. 

[(Except Residents of Quebec, Non-restricted firearms must be registered click here for more)](https://siaf.gouv.qc.ca/accueil.html?L=1)

&nbsp;

Next I’ll describe how to purchase and possess a non-restricted firearm in Canada. These are your typical rifles/shotguns.

1.	Attend and pass the Canadian firearms safety course (CFSC) this course is a government mandated safety course that teaches prospective firearm owners how to safely handle, transport, and store firearms. It also covers some basic legal requirements, regulations and your responsibilities as a gun owner. There is a test at the end to determine if you have met the education requirements. Failure of the test requires the participant to either retake the course or if the instructor is satisfied they can just retake the test component again. This is the first stage of gun control in Canada as the potential applicant is being examined by the instructor who can report safety concerns to the police i.e. the potential applicant seems mentally disturbed or professes violence towards other people both of which are investigated by the police.

2.	After successfully passing the CFSC, the applicant can apply for a PAL. Note it is illegal to possess a firearm unless you are the holder of a PAL, an executor of an estate to temporarily transfer firearms, or a citizen who found a firearm and must report its possession with reasonable dispatch to the police so they can take possession of it. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s 91 (1)Unauthorized possession of firearm, (4) Exceptions)

3.	[The PAL application](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/pdfs/5592-eng.pdf) asks several questions that must be answered, lying on the forms is a criminal offense (Firearms Act S.C. 1995, c. 39 s. 106 (1) False statements). The questions include, 

 a.	have you been charged, convicted or granted a discharge in Canada? 

 b.	have you been subjected to a peace bond? 

 c.	are you or any members of your household prohibited from possessing any firearm, 

 d.	have you threatened or attempted suicide or have you been suffering, diagnosed or 
treated for mental problems,

 e.	 have you threatened violence or been reported to the police for violence? 

 f.	have you suffered a Significant negative event such as divorce, job loss, or bankruptcy? 

 g.	Your current conjugal status, i.e. girlfriend/wife and their contact information and the 
contact information of any ex-conjugal partners over the past 2 years. (They will be contacted to determine if you should be allowed to possess firearms)

 h.	You must provide 2 references that have known you for at least 3 years, they will and can be contacted to determine if you should possess firearms. 

**Note:** if you personally have any reservations or concerns about a PAL holder or applicant you can contact your local police non-emergency line for non-urgent concerns or 911 for immediate concerns.

4.	After a PAL application is submitted there is a legal requirement to delay all applications by a minimum of 28 days. [(Firearms Licences Regulations (SOR/98-199) s. 3 (5))](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-199/page-1.html#h-5)No processing takes place until the 28 day waiting period is over. Typically, the licensing process takes between 45 days from the application being received up to 220 days depending on the current backlog, background checks, reference checks, and if the Provincial Chief firearms office wants to interview you if they have questions about your application. 

5.	Once a PAL is issued to you may purchase and possess non-restricted firearms. The seller is required to check if you possess a valid PAL as it is illegal to transfer a firearm to someone not authorized to possess it. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s.100 (1) Weapons Trafficking, s.101 (1) Transfer without Authority)

6.	You must notify your provincial Chief firearms officer (CFO) if you move and your new address within 30 days of the move. If you do not the CFO can revoke your license for breach of your license conditions. ((SOR/98-199) s. 15 Conditions) Every PAL holder has their name and current address registered and recorded, if your name/address is run in a police computer they are notified that you have a PAL. 

&nbsp;

As you can see the process from start to finish takes a minimum of 2-3 months to process a license taking longer if need be for background checks. Another aspect of Gun Control is that during the entire time you have a PAL you are subjected to [Continuous Eligibility screening via The Canadian police information centre (CPIC)](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/fire-feu-eval/pg6-2-eng.htm). Every day your personal information is compared to all the police interactions entered into the CPIC database to determine if you have committed, been charged or have had any interaction with the police that may require the CFO to revoke your PAL and confiscate your firearms. 

The Provincial CFO also has the power to revoke your PAL if it is in the interests of public safety or if they are aware you have been involved in domestic violence or stalking.  ((SOR/98-199) s. 16 (1) Revocation)


&nbsp;

**Storage, transportation and handling requirements of non-restricted firearms.** [(Storage, Display, Transportation and Handling of Firearms by Individuals Regulations (SOR/98-209))]( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-209/index.html)

 1.	**Storage:** All firearms must be stored unloaded, and either locked in a container/cabinet, trigger or cable locked, or the bolt must be removed and locked away. In layman terms the firearm must be secured to prevent the firearm from being easily discharged. Exception: if the firearm is used for predator protection in the wilderness it may be kept unlocked and ready to fire, but it may not be left loaded.  (SOR/98-209, s. 5 (1) Storage of non-restricted firearms)

 2.	**Transportation:** All firearms must be transported unloaded; and it must not be readily visible from the outside of your vehicle i.e. Cover and bag your firearms. (SOR/98-209, s. 10 (1) Transport of non-restricted firearms)

 3.	**Handling:** Non-restricted firearms can only be loaded where they may be legally discharged. This is also subjected to other municipal, provincial and federal laws that provide exemptions or restrictions. You can legally discharge firearms on Crown land/private property and at gun ranges depending on your provincial laws. (SOR/98-209, s. 15 Handling of firearms)


&nbsp;

All of this was just the procedure and requirements to own an ordinary rifle/shotgun.

&nbsp;

Now what if you want a Restricted firearm? These are typically handguns that are not classified as prohibited, short rifles/shotguns and any firearm that is restricted by name this includes all AR-15 variants. 

The same procedure applies as before except you must take an additional safety course, the Canadian restricted firearms safety course (CRFSC) and pass its test. It covers the same topics as the CFSC except it goes into the different legal requirements of storing, transporting, possessing and handling a restricted firearm. Once you have met the educational requirements you can apply for a PAL with restricted endorsement commonly shortened to RPAL. You are still subjected to the same background checks and procedures to obtain a PAL as this is just an additional endorsement to your license. 

The biggest difference between non-restricted and restricted firearms is the procedure to purchase and possess a restricted firearm. All legal restricted firearms are registered in Canada, every time a restricted firearm changes owner the Canadian firearms registry must record the transfer between owners, issue a registration certificate to the new owner and update the ownership records. This process takes between 1 day to 2 months depending on the Province and backlog of transfers. [(SOR/98-202) s. 3 (1) Conditions]( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-202/page-1.html#h-2)
 
Restricted firearms also need a reason to possess, there are 3 reasons to possess a restricted firearm in Canada. Target shooting, Collecting and Self-defense (More on this later). Most restricted firearms in Canada are possessed for Target shooting and collecting. [ (SOR/98-202) s. 3 (3) Conditions](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-202/page-1.html#h-2)

A Self-defense endorsement to possess a firearm is rarely issued as the Provincial CFO must be satisfied that the reason for your possession is not a public safety risk. Most self defense endorsements are made to Armored car guards, trappers and geologists in the far wilderness, and people that have an active threat against their life and that the protection of the police is not enough to mitigate it. A police department must usually sign a statement or support your application for a Self-defense endorsement if it is not for your profession (armored car guard, geologist, trapper). There are usually conditions attached to the Self-defense endorsement such as the firearms may only be possessed in certain locations, or only while you are working in your profession. 

This endorsement is typically paired along side Authorization to Carry (ATC) [Authorizations to Carry Restricted Firearms and Certain Handguns Regulations (SOR/98-207)] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-207/page-1.html#h-2). 

**NOTE:** Very few ATC’s or self defense endorsements are issued in Canada and most of the ones that are issued are to armored car guards for their protection while working. If you need a Self defense endorsement it is usually because someone else tells you to get one.

&nbsp;
 
**Process to acquire your first restricted firearm.** 

1.	Provide your new RPAL to the seller of the restricted firearm

2.	Seller initiates the transfer with the Canadian firearms program (CFP), they check your eligibility to possess a restricted firearm. 

3.	You the buyer confirm your details with the CFP that you are transferring a restricted firearm to your name. 

4.	The Provincial CFO checks the reason you are possessing a restricted firearm, if you are a target shooter you must provide your gun range membership to them as the only place to legally shoot a restricted firearm is at a gun range. If you are a collector you must be able to provide the historical/technological/scientific characteristics that distinguish the restricted firearm (i.e that make it special) and you also consent to periodic inspections. 

5.	Once the transfer is approved (which can take anywhere from 1 day to 2 months to approve) the seller can transfer the firearm to you. 

6.	Congratulations you are now the proud owner of a restricted firearm registered to you. It is a criminal offense to not possess a registration certificate for any restricted firearms in your possession. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 91 (1) Unauthorized possession of firearm)

&nbsp;

**Storage, transportation and handling requirements of restricted firearms.** [(SOR/98-209)]( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-209/index.html)

1. **Storage:** Restricted firearms must be unloaded and be double locked, i.e. the firearm must be prevented from firing either by the removal of the bolt, or by a trigger/cable locking the firearm and it must also be locked in a storage container/cabinet at the address attached to your RPAL. 

 You must notify your provincial CFO if you move and your new address within 30 days of the move. If you do not the CFO can revoke your license for breach of your license conditions and confiscate your firearms. (SOR-98-209 s. 6 (1) Storage of Restricted firearm)

2. **Transportation:** To transport a restricted firearm you must possess an Authorization to transport (ATT) that lists the conditions that allow you to transport your restricted firearms. Typically for target shooters it allows you to transport your restricted firearms to: any CFO approved gun range in the province of your residence, ports of exit/entry (airports, border crossings to go overseas), gun stores, gunsmiths, gun shows and to the police. It also typically dictates that you must take a reasonably direct route to and from the authorized location, i.e stopping for gas is okay, stopping at a mall 2 hours away from an authorized location is not. For Collectors they can only usually transport to and from gun shows, a gunsmith or to the police, not for target shooting. 

 When transporting a restricted firearm it must be unloaded, and doubled locked i.e. Locked from firing and locked into a secure storage container. You must also possess your RPAL, your registration certificate stating that the restricted firearm is registered to you and an ATT. (SOR-98-209 s. 11 (1) Transport of Restricted firearm)

 Possessing a firearm in an unauthorized place is a criminal offense. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 93 (1) Possession at unauthorized place) 


3. **Handling:** Restricted firearms can only be loaded where they may be legally discharged. This is also subjected to other municipal, provincial and federal laws that provide exemptions or restrictions. Practically speaking restricted firearms can only be loaded and discharged at Government approved gun ranges. 


**Frequently asked questions:**

**Q. The liberals promise to repeal bill C-42 introduced and passed by the Conservatives in 2015 as they say it weakens the current gun control laws, what exactly does C-42 do and did it weaken gun control laws?**

A. [RCMP Summary bulletin on C-42](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/bulletins/bus-ent/20150619-91-eng.htm) 

What C-42 did was make taking the CFSC/CRFSC mandatory as before C-42 you could challenge the safety test without taking the course if you studied for it on your own time. It also made it so that if you were convicted of domestic violence you were subjected to a mandatory firearms prohibition order. It allowed the issuance of an electronic ATT that is attached to your RPAL for your restricted firearms, so when transporting them you only need to possess your RPAL and the registration certificate to cutdown on the amount of paperwork that needed to be mailed to you. You are still subjected to all the conditions of the electronic ATT which **do not** allow you to stop at shopping malls, grocery stores and hockey arenas. 

It is still a criminal offense to possess a firearm in an unauthorized location i.e. if it is not at your house, at a gun range, or with the police you are breaking the law. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 93 (1) Possession at unauthorized place)

&nbsp;

**Q. Anyone can get an ATC ! That must mean we have lots of guns on our streets.**

A. People in certain professions: Armored car guards, trappers and geologists in far wilderness areas, comprise the majority of the people that possess ATC's. Very few ATC's are issued/authorized to citizens for everyday carry. 

&nbsp;


**Q. Ammunition needs to be strictly controlled!**

A. It is illegal to transfer ammunition to someone not authorized to possess it. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 101 (1) Transfer without authority)

&nbsp;

**Q. Are full auto firearms allowed in Canada?**

A. Yes, but only to Prohibited License holders with the right designation on their license. Practically speaking the Government only issues them to movie companies (for filming movies), and gunsmiths (to be able to possess them to repair them). Very few civilians possess the necessary licenses and endorsements to possess Full auto prohibited firearms as these licenses haven’t been newly issued since the 1970’s (Firearms Act S.C. 1995, c. 39 s. 12 (2) Grandfathered individuals). Prohibited firearms are triple locked in storage, by having their firing mechanism removed and locked away, the firearm trigger/cable locked, and the firearm locked in a separate storage container. [(Storage, Display, Transportation and Handling of Firearms by Individuals Regulations (SOR/98-209))]( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-209/index.html)

Importation of prohibited firearms is strictly controlled and most prohibited firearms imported into Canada are for the movie business only. 

&nbsp;

**Q. What about bump stocks, they replicate full auto and are dangerous we need to ban them!**

A. Bump stocks are banned in Canada as they are classified as a prohibited device, specifically *any device that alters or allows a firearm to mimic fully automatic fire* is prohibited. 

Possessing a prohibited device is a criminal offense. [Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and Other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited, Restricted or Non-Restricted (SOR/98-462)] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/FullText.html) (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 91 (2) Unauthorized possession of prohibited weapon or restricted weapon)

&nbsp;

**Q. The Magazine capacities in Canada are too high we need to heavily restrict them!**

A. This is an annoying patchwork of different interpretations (which need to be simplified), but simply put semi auto centerfire rifles and shotguns magazines are limited to 5 shots, and handgun magazines to 10 shots. Manually operated rifles and shotguns magazines (bolt, lever, pump) and all rimfire rifle magazines (semi, pump, lever, bolt) have no limit. 

There are many grey areas, different interpretations and exceptions which I won’t get into and could occupy its own post. 

A magazine that is over-capacity is a prohibited device and is not permitted for civilian possession. [(SOR/98-462) Part 4 s. 3 (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/FullText.html) (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 91 (2) Unauthorized possession of prohibited weapon or restricted weapon)

&nbsp;

**Q. I’ve heard the AR-15 is easily converted to full auto we need to ban them!**


A. A Civilian AR-15 has several security safe guards to prevent their conversion from semi-auto to full auto. I won’t describe them here but the RCMP inspect any imported firearms that are sold in Canada and any firearm that is *easily convertible to full auto, in a relatively short period of time with relative ease* is prohibited [(R. v. Hasselwander)] (https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1007/index.do ) and not allowed for sale. 

Every firearm that is imported into Canada is inspected to ensure they are classified appropriately and do not pose a public safety risk by following the laws passed by parliament. It is also a criminal offense to make any automatic (full auto) firearm in Canada. (Criminal Code R.S.C. , 1985, c-46, s. 102 (1) Making automatic firearm)

&nbsp;

**Q. Why get rid of the long gun registry doesn’t it protect Canadians?**

A. The long gun registry (LGR) (which was to register non-restricted firearms) cost over 1 billion dollars over the 10 year period it was running. The Government of Canada won a court case [Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic v. Canada, 2014 ONSC 5140 (CanLII)]( https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2014/2014onsc5140/2014onsc5140.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAAAAAAEAFzIwMTIgT05TQyA1MjcxIChDYW5MSUkpAAAAAQANLzIwMTJvbnNjNTI3MQE&resultIndex=3) that ruled Parliament could repeal the Long gun registry as it had no discernable effects to public safety and did not violate Canadians section 7 charter rights of fundamental justice or charter 15 rights of equality. 

All restricted firearms (handguns, short rifles/shotguns and the AR-15), and prohibited firearms are still registered and have been registered since the 1930's 

&nbsp;

**TL;DR** 

Canada has a robust, if sometimes confusing gun control system. That is mostly focused on preventing people that are not suitable for gun ownership from possessing firearms. (Criminals, mentally unstable people, violent people, and suicidal people). It also continuously screens PAL holders to ensure they are not a public safety risk, and the CFO has the power to revoke any PAL license in the interests of public safety. The PAL process is I believe the strongest part of the gun control system Canada has. 


**Reminder:** If you or someone you know has any concerns about someone who possess firearms, i.e. you know someone has become depressed as they have recently lost a job, or someone is professing violent tendencies towards specific groups/people, or you know someone is not properly storing firearms or is misusing them. Report your concerns: if non-urgent to the Canadian firearms program or in an emergency to 911. The police cannot be every where and require information to follow up on public safety concerns.

http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/cont/index-eng.htm


Hopefully this gives Canadians a good introduction to the current gun control laws we have in Canada and a better direction in what can be tweaked or improved.

I would say there were similar feelings during the end of alcohol prohibition, that being said we are all citizens of one of the if not the best places to live in the world because of how great Canada is at welcoming people, cultures, new ideas, science, religion, politics etc. 
We all have different ideas on things and that's great, dabates are needed, open dialogue should happen, narrow mindedness is not a trait most Canadians share, and by no means am I saying we are perfect we are all different and that's what's beautiful.

So in this post I would like to pose a question on the legal issue of intoxication to you my fellow Canadians and see where you all stand. 
I'm not sure if this is topic has gotten as much attention in the news as it should, maybe I'm wrong if so please correct me. I know there has been some chatting in the comments some news article posts and people seem to have different opinions on the matter, one recent news article in particular would be the recent development in the Alberta Oil Sands of Unifor vs Suncor Energy trying to implement random drug testing to its Union/Non-Union employees. In no way do I condone doing drugs/alcohol before you go to work or at work as well as driving a vehicle up the road or across town. Currently the industry standard for pre-job employment is  50-15 ng/ml of THC in the urine for Suncor employees and some contracting companies are using swab testing. Below are news articles discussing possible road side testing to come.

From what I have seen intoxication levels of Cannabis use will be as follows:

-Regulated limit of THC in a driver’s blood stream.

-Roadside saliva test would be conducted to help determine impairment

– Driving within two hours an illegal amount of THC in the blood will be punishable by fines ranging from up to $1,000 to up to life in jail

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/3377790/canada-proposed-legal-pot-law-what-you-need-to-know/amp/

Also

Drivers who have a blood drug concentration of more than two nanograms of THC (per mililitre of blood) but less than five nanograms could be found guilty of drugged driving under the proposed summary offence, which has a maximum fine of $1,000.

Drivers caught with more than five nanograms of THC in their blood would be guilty of impaired driving, while drivers with both alcohol and THC in their system would be considered impaired if they have more than 50 miligrams of alcohol (per 100 mililitres of blood) and greater than 2.5 nanograms of THC in their blood.

http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/politics/drugged-driving-limits-thc-1.4354336

With this being said I have some questions

1. What type of testing for Impairment of cannabis do you believe would be best suited to address the issue of road side tests for impaired driving, Saliva, urine, blood/Concentration?
2. Do you believe the current proposed penalties are too harsh?
3. Do you believe companies have the right to dictate to citizens what they should do in their personal lives regarding legal recreational substances?
4. Do you believe the government will step in to aid in changing and discussing changes to work place drug testing involving Cannabis with major corporations?
5. Are there any highly efficient ways to test for impairment of THC at the time that are not main stream or are there any companies dedicating themselves to the development this type of technology that you know of?

After finding it puzzling today that so many Canadians on Reddit are vehemently opposed to strengthening laws against corruption by government officials, it became clear to me that an organized effort was likely underway to manipulate public opinion by a so-called “50 Cent Party”. As a consequence, I decided to find out exactly how else the Chinese government has been assisting the Canadian Liberal Party.

I asked myself, if I were the Chinese government and wanted to illegally assist the Canadian Liberal Party, how would I do so? Given the prohibition on corporate donations, the easiest way to do this would be to channel the money through Chinese dual nationals, likely the same individuals who own homes here while actually living in China [these individuals may or may not actually exist].

Surely, this would be too obvious, however, as it would lead to rather unusual cross-country contributions from Chinese nationals, located primarily in Vancouver, to Liberal riding associations across the country. Surely, our elections officials would notice something so obvious, right?
Wrong!

Here is the elections contributions data available for download from Elections Canada: http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=fin&dir=oda&document=index&lang=e
All you have to do to see the evidence yourself is to filter for contributions by individuals from BC to out-of-province Riding Associations of over $1000. Here is a photo of the results for the Papineau Liberal Riding Association (edit: deleted).

You will notice that:

1)	Most riding associations outside of BC receive either no or only a handful of contributions from individuals in BC

2)	The following riding associations received large numbers of high-value out-of-province contributions, with these contributions almost entirely made by individuals with Chinese names:

•	Calgary Midnapore Conservative Association (**Jason Kenney**; 14 out of 15 contributions suspicious)

•	Orléans Federal Liberal Association (**Andrew Leslie**; 33 out of 36 contributions suspicious)

•	Papineau Federal Liberal Association (**Justin Trudeau**; 109 out of 109 contributions suspicious)

We must demand an immediate investigation and explanation by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


Edit 1: You will note that I also discovered that Jason Kenney received suspect contributions, so please drop the partisan pitchforks. This issue is more important than partisan bickering.


**Edit 2: Note that the sum of suspect contributions to Trudeau's Papineau Riding Association was not insignificant, at $151,835.45, exceeding his actual expenditures during the election.**

Edit 3: More evidence: some individuals donated to both Papineau and Orleans. Must be just another coincidence.

**Edit 4: Andrew Leslie (Orléans Federal Liberal) is friends with Micheal Flynn. Yes, that Michael Flynn. He was appointed as parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to establish a good relationship with the Trump team. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-promotes-former-general-to-forge-closer-ties-with-us/article33643165/** As best I can tell, Andrew Leslie was head of the Canadian Army in Kandahar from 2006 to 2010.

Open to critiques I did not proof read this or edit it really so I'm sure it could use some refinement.



Be a hero.

What and who we are determines what labels we choose or are assigned, but those labels then shape what and who we are.  A nice cognitive shortcut becomes a prison of dogma and easy ""moral"" judgements to which we must adhere or risk losing our preferred labels or be cast out from the crowd.  We imprison our intellect and lock away our empathy in service to an ideal or tribe which defines how we see the world.

This is so very clear in today's political and social climate.  In our socially networked world we have entered a so called ""post truth"" era.  Facts and truth have seemingly become nebulous shifting constructs and increasingly our response has been to withdraw into our own comfortable bubbles where we can reaffirm our beliefs and world view with others of like mind.  The world seems more scary and dangerous than ever before, it certainly does FEEL that way, and in certain very specific respects it is arguably so, but empirically it is very much a safer place today than 10,20,30,40 and on and on years ago.  That is not a soft squishy construct of a fact, that is statistically a reality by any rational non ideological unemotional measure.  

What is however a serious risk to us is social and intellectual decoherence.  Incoherence.  Disconnection.  

In the last few years I think there has been a growing discontent, fuelled both by economics and the impacts of the internet, manifesting itself in various ways for various causes on all areas of the political spectrum... But this discontent has also been expressed in increasingly dogmatic, emotional, and unintellectual fashions.  The leaders of our social movements adopt their labels and make their causes into their life's work, unable and unwilling to compromise or see the world or their actions in a more all-encompassing manner.  The rhetoric and vitriol has risen, on all sides of every issue which can be enumerated, to a level which simply ignores reality and attempts to drown out the ""other side"" ... Often drawing all involved to morally and intellectually indefensible positions, which the average label wearer even being of kind a good spirit will espouse without actually thinking of the ramifications they are talking about.

In the case of social justice issues on some level the fight to recognize certain labels for people is quite arguably against everyone's best interests... At least in the ways and manner in which the most vocal and most aggressive advocates would state... And make no mistake, those out front of these movements are those which are guiding the ship.  Label wearers are not actually steering these movements, they just lend their vote and voice to the intentions of others.

These movements are not wrong by and large.  The average person within them is not wrong, especially not in intention.  The singleminded hive mentality however is a dangerous trap into which we have fallen.

Some examples of things which I think ideological adherents have been blinded to... Some may find offense, and I hope you do not doubt at least my intention regardless if you find some... Please just have an open mind.

Gender is a cultural construct.... This is stated as cold fact by many in several social movements as a hard fact.  While that would possibly be an absolutely ideal situation for humanity as a whole it is empirically and scientifically false, and the implications of accepting it as fact can be catastrophically harmful (there was a specific instance to which I will not link in which a young man eventually took his own life after being altered as a child to be female) There are real definable differences in brain structure etc. Etc. ... That doesn't mean Transgender people do not absolutely deserve respect, dignity, medical and societal support as anyone else with a complicated situation.  But the dogmatic position is false, and could and likely WILL lead to some horrible consequences down the road.  

Other side of the ""aisle"" - conservatives and environmentalism.  The same kind of team-building and moreso reactionary and emotional position taking has meant climate change denial or minimalising.  Not because of facts or reason but because the other side must be wrong in some way and has already planted a flag.

In business and in politics too, the tight adherence to profit above all other concerns is inarguably one of the largest issues which has plagued mankind since the advent of agriculture... And attempts to rectify that have fallen prey to the same reactionary decision making to which I am trying to illuminate here... The consequences of which have been disastrous.

We can't afford to be just environmentalists, that would likely collapse the house of cards we have built which we call an economy.

MADD, mother's against drunk driving, a laudable organization with an excellent cause has run on from their massive successes bringing evidence and science based .08 laws into effect throughout the US and Canada has moved on with their cause past evidence and science to lobbying for ever increasing restrictions, lower limits than evidence suggests are actually required.  One could argue about the potential benefits from the social pressure etc but on its face being for zero tolerance or limits which could catch up a person who had recently used mouth wash would again have very negative impacts on society.

Affirmative action, in many respects a laudable initiative upon its inception has become a tool which has lost sight of its own effects on those it purports to help.  While prioritizing those who should be better represented is clearly a good for society and those effected by it if you do something such as impose a quota you can cause real harm to those being helped.  An example... Take an advanced engineering course at a top level school.  While those who are selected via affirmative action are incredibly smart they are also likely to be ""the dumbest person in the class."" ... I'll restate again I am not against affirmative action at its core (we should have an eye to picking the best of (group) with the best chances of success above those of (group) as appropriate) I am against the slow creeping expansion of quotas to fill positions as I see it as likely setting those persons up to fail.

Politically our politicians do not act empirically or intellectually or even bravely, because we will not let them.  We demand our emotions be catered to, not our actual needs or actual best interests.  

The black rights movement in the US has tinges of reactionary thought and action within it, much understandable but no less damaging to their movement and generally society.  I'll go no further than to cite the instances of publicly broadcasted torture by misguided adherents to this cause, it is a delicate issue and one to which I feel less able to hold a stance on than some others.



We cannot afford to be reactionary in our morals and values and causes any longer.

We cannot afford to choose a team or cause and see it through ""to the end."" Because there is no end.  There is always a tomorrow, and if your cause reaches its goal tomorrow than it will see that the grass doesn't seem greener... And will continue to march on with social and political momentum far off beyond reality or reason.

The founder of the first women's shelter who spent decades of her life working with and counselling victims of abuse was pushed out of her own organization due to her understanding of cycles of abuse and the interplay in abusive relationships.  The empirical fact that many people (not all) in abusive relationships both abuse and are abused, that some even seek that instability due to being acclimated to it in childhood, but once that portion of the cause had reached its goal it moved on past what is a clear truth and pushed to the ""Duluth model"" in which men are assigned the label of abuser and women are assigned the label of victim with no exceptions.  This is actual legal fact in many US states, with a choice quote along the lines of ""if she hits you again you better hope she doesn't cut her hand on your teeth or you are going to prison.""   I can't think of a more sexist and unjust law both for men but also for women, a grotesque mockery of the core beliefs of feminism or egalitarianism.  What is supposed to be a legal protection has morphed into a codified law which strips women of their agency and power, defining them solely as passive victims with no agency or power.

Our labels are also used against us as a weapon.  It is no small secret that, at least as some would espouse, that foreign influence has played some part in both some of my list of issues but as well as shaping and defining our current political narratives.  Polarizing us.  Dividing us.  They are also used within our culture however, to do the same.  Welfare, the social safety net.  A system which has been slowly eroded away to a point which it is a cruel joke, and carries with it such a stigma that the common person will openly mock and deride those who require it.  They will unashamedly and unironically state that it should be cut off, or ended, or that we should administer drug testing across the board to recipients.  In line with the other issues though.... All of these things are empirically terrible terrible ideas.  Either wasteful in terms of costs or at the risk of causing a more general societal collapse.   Wear the label of self reliance long enough many have forgotten that we rely on every other member of society to survive and thrive ourselves, and that regardless of their value to society providing for a starving man is much less costly to society than the consequence of letting him starve.  And they forget that their position in the world was created and enabled by countless others now and in the past.

What then, if political action and the world of today with our ability to so rapidly advance and communicate that causes and movements can ""react"" so quickly that within the span of a few years we can go from (relatively) business as usual to riots and shadows of fascism, broadcast racial torture and murder, and a collection of increasingly unreasoned and unreasonable social movements, what to do?

Credit to an interesting discussion I heard by professor Jordan Peterson, distilled down to a thought.  Instead of being a (Label) be a hero. The biblical and mythological archetype of a hero.  I am not talking about slaying dragons or performing sacrifices, although that is something one must do.  A hero stands on the edge of the map.  One foot in the known, and one foot in the unknown.  The dragon is the unknown, the different, the strange... But the unknown is where discovery and true progress exists, both for yourself as a person and for society and humanity itself.  We cannot stand in the known and claim to know reality based on every increasingly distorted depictions of what lay beyond the maps borders.  So step out of your camps, and learn what lays beyond them, challenge your perceptions, your morals, your values, your reality.  Heroes do that. They venture beyond and bring back wonderous treasures and truths for which we all benefit. Heroes are willing to sacrafice. Their ties, their bodies, their lives if need be. In this context... Just think. Understand, deeply.  Do not fall to the level of simply seeking to prove wrong through some ideological trap, or to undermine an entire view through a minor or major flaw in fact or reason but seek to deeply understand the core issue or motivations involved.  It is likely, or even inevitable, that when you reach that understanding it you will be faced with a dragon.  A truth of the world which your own ""tribe"" is completely blind or willfully oblivious to, and something which is a genuine threat.  And with that deep understanding you may come to see solutions as yet unseen, or see the wrong in your own actions... And then you must sacrafice, for the greater good.

Ultimately there are no sides here, there is only humanity, and a planet on which we stand in an infinity of space and time.  We have our stories we tell and our illusory social constructs which shape our lives and experiences, our societies, our very existence and understanding of it.  

And today these stories are at odds with our more concrete reality.  Our political and social stories... Constructs...  are so far distorted from it and our modern tools that it begins to threaten our very survial.

Be a hero.

It is for the above reasons I choose to reject these labels.  I am not a liberal, or a conservative.  I am not a feminist or an MRA.  I am not a Troll or an SJW or a shill. I am not an activist or a journalist. I am not a racist or a nationalist. I am not white or Scottish or Canadian. I am not a Man, or part of the Patriarchy, I am not lower class or poor, I am not a son or a brother or a father. I am not a worker or a supervisor.  To an outsider I fit some or many of these labels, but to me inside I reject them.  I am human, and so are you. I choose the label hero. I choose to understand you and the world as it is, not through the lens of my labels or those of others but as it is.

I do not mean this as being self righteous, the label of hero carries a lot of unavoidable baggage, but stripped down to the intellectual and moral framework in which it is described here... It is the best and most positively framed label I have yet encountered which properly embodies... What I think is the only rational ethical and moral approach to conducting one's self and guiding ones principles, morals, actions, and understanding.  

What's more... Beyond this... We must begin to demand such a world view from our leaders.  We MUST abandon these plodding ideological monstrosities in favor of reason science and logic.  People's lives are being lost, wasted and thrown away while we wring our hands over straight forward issues.  We marched on glassy eyed into a housing bubble of epic proportions while an ever increasing number of experts sounded alarms, and listened to those with clear vested interests in a rosy view of the situation for our own greed. We marched on glassy eyed even as people blew the whistle over tainted blood supplies, through greed and expediency. We watched as yet another generation of youth were criminalized by marijuana prohibition while we slowly found it in our hearts to rid ourselves of a moral stigma rooted in corporate greed and political and racial hatred. We sit back and watch with disinterest as that same generation struggles to form families and ""begin"" life, ignoring all the statistical and economic and socioeconomic causes of it and instead blaming it on some moral failing.  We squabble and effectively do nothing as global warming becomes a clear and present danger, turning am empirical reality into a politicized issue because you know greed and comfort with how things are now.  We ignore the growing discontent and health problems of men despite the hypocrisy of such to our stated ideals and men grin and bear it because we are supposed to.  We ignore the real structural and systematic issues which continue to perpetuate the situation of natives in our country, and natives refuse to introspect or adjust their own side in light of reality as well.  

Some things about life are up for debate, and careful deliberation.  Some things are simply not, and making them political issues is ethically abhorrent.  We are animals who play games and learn. We are on a hunk of rock hurtling around the Sun.  Water is wet. CO2 is a green house gas.  None of this is political.  

Abortion should be legal. That could be political.  Tax curves, that is political.  Growing inequality that rivals the gilded age, That is a hard fact, and one which we must be more cognizant of and of its ramifications.

We are moving too slowly on many issues, and ignoring real dangers in favor of... Increasingly petty and increasingly counterproductive social issues and causes.  


I apologize for rambling at the end.  It's hard to not when trying to be comprehensive and clear.

Be a hero.  Think.  Question.  Sacrafice your sacred cows if needed.  Because if we don't fix this we may face a real crisis...

In this case, driving under the influence of Alcohol vs driving under the influence of Marijuana.

As of April 13th 2017, the new relevant legislation will have an upper punishment of **10 years in jail** for driving while under the influence of Marijuana.

* http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-table-marijuana-bill-that-includes-crackdown-on-impaired-drivers/article34696586/

Meanwhile driving while under the influence of Alcohol, has a maximum sentence of **18 months in jail**.

* http://legalbeagle.com/6114545-dui-penalties-canada.html

I tried to find statistics around how _specifically_ marijuana impacts traffic collisions/incidents and such, but I was not able to find such refined statistics as it seems most of the time they are lumped in with other ""drugs"", and simply labelled ""Drug-impaired driving"". Thus far it makes it hard to find reliable stats that are _only_ for marijuana.

* http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2016001/article/14679-eng.htm

Meanwhile we have fairly good statistics for drunk (alcohol) driving.

* http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadas-drunk-driving-death-rate-worst-among-wealthy-countries-u-s-study-finds

It also seems that a substantial amount of people believe that driving while under the influence of Marijuana is not ""as bad"" as while under the influence of Alcohol. Take note the source here is from a group that is _against_ ""drugs"", which is not an impartial source.

* http://madd.ca/pages/programs/youth-services/statistics-links/

It seems to me that some interesting conclusions can be arrived from this information. Perhaps you can draw your own, but some thoughts of my own:

1. We don't have enough actual (impartial) statistics to prove/disprove the effect Marijuana has on drivers. Yet substantially more information is available for Alcohol.
2. The punishment slated for legislature is not balanced when comparing Marijuana vs Alcohol.
3. How do these new punishments affect people who take Marijuana medicinally? Are they just no longer allowed to drive any more?
4. I think we as Canadians can do a better job than this, namely through getting better facts to guide our plans.
5. Marijuana prohibition is costly in its current form, and new costs can arise from the new legislature in its current form.

Do with this information as you will. I've tried to present this as impartially and fairly as I could. Any parts that could be subjective, I tried to clearly state them.

I actually don't even know where to send this either (n)


Canada has suffered a great tragedy. Many lives were taken for no reason in Quebec City. As a result of this the media has called for stricter gun laws and regulations, despite not really understanding the system we already have in place. What’s even more surprising is they ignore the mental health and political radicalization issue and seem to focus more on the firearm. They also seem to focus on the gun community as a whole instead of the criminals. I would like to go over some recent articles and compare what they have wrote to the actual gun laws. 

The first article i would like to review is “ANDRÉ PICARD-
In wake of Quebec City shooting, Canada must break silence around gun control”.[1]
In this article Mr.Picard is quoted as saying “But we can make it more difficult to get guns.
From a public-health and public-safety perspective, easy access to guns is the weak link in the chain, and the one that is easiest to strengthen.”[1] At this time to get a firearm in Canada you must complete a safety course for both restricted and non restricted firearms. This is a written and practical test and must be completed as of Bill C-42. Before the bill, you could challenge the test without taking a safety course[2]. Not only that but you are required to submit 2 references, you current and former conjugal partners information so they can be contacted.[3] and once you do get it, you are subject to a background check every 24 hrs.[5] Another quote from the article “Bill C-42 weakened the provisions related to firearms acquisition and possession licences. For example, stores don’t need to register gun sales any more, only the owner does. (And gun registration was not universal to start with; for example, we have no idea where Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the 2014 Parliament Hill shooter, got his gun.) The legislation also made it a lot easier to purchase high-powered weapons.” [1] This is incorrect since all restricted and prohibited firearms are registered with the RCMP.[11] Bill C-42 also introduced legislation which made it mandatory for retailers to share all import info on any restricted or prohibited weapon[2]. These types of weapons cannot leave the store until the registration of that weapon has been transferred to you. Non- restricted weapons do not fall under these guidelines and are the only ones not registered.[4] The last quote from this article i would like to quote is “In Canada, it’s easy to acquire and stockpile a virtually unlimited number of guns, restricted or otherwise. All you have to do is be a member of a gun club or shooting range, or be a “collector.” (The alleged Quebec City mosque shooter was a regular at a shooting range.) Prohibited guns seem easy enough to acquire too.” In Canada we are subject to possible inspection by the RCMP.[6] Prohibited guns are not easy to get, they are prohibited for a reason. Select individuals have prohibited license condition granted to them, and others are business. Furthermore there are several classes of prohibited weapons ranging from short historical pistols to full automatic weapons. [7] Key points in this article were made without any true firearm knowledge, and there are not even sources listed for his claims. 

The second article i would like to go over is “Quebec City mosque shooting: Despite strict Canadian laws, illegal guns still within reach”[8]  In this article they are quoted say “And while some rifles are banned by name, knock-offs are allowed, he said.”[8] This is again not true.  Here is a section of the actual law “ 

- 20 The firearm of the design commonly known as the Gepard long-range sniper rifle, and any variant or modified version of it.

- 21 The firearm of the design commonly known as the Heckler and Koch (HK) Model G11 rifle, and any variant or modified version of it.

- 22 The firearm of the design commonly known as the Research Armament Industries (RAI) Model 500 rifle, and any variant or modified version of it.

- 23 The firearm of the design commonly known as the Spectre Auto Carbine, and any variant or modified version of it.[9]

Notice how in every one of those each variant and modified version is banned? They went as far to even prohib a prototype weapon, the G11 which was never mass produced. Why visually as CZ858 may look like an AK47, functionally it is more similar to an SKS. in fact the AK and 858 share no parts and use  different  gas systems.[10]  Again this article made a claim despite the laws being outlined.

",canada,I would like to point out a few misleading and outright wrong points from recent articles on Gun control,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5s1u2e/i_would_like_to_point_out_a_few_misleading_and/
donniemills,New Brunswick,1486053519,,False,5rnszn,False,True,t3_5rnszn,114,False,/r/canada/comments/5rnszn/broken_promises/,30,"I'm disappointed in the broken electoral reform promise, but I am taking it all in context. First, it was not the end all and be all of the platform for me. I was done with the muzzling of scientists, with ignoring climate change, I was done with cutting the GST to get elected and then going straight into a deficit. 

It sucks that we won't have our electoral reform...yet. I suspect we will someday, especially if we push our MPs and make our voices heard. I just don't think it is our biggest issue to tackle right now. 

The other context that is that election promises are always broken and I'm still happier under Trudeau than I would have been under Harper. 

And as a reminder, here's our past Prime Minister's broken promises:

2006 Conservative Platform:

14.Allow citizens, not just politicians, to make complaints to the Ethics Commissioner.
 
15.Implement the Information Commissioner’s recommendations for reform of the Access to Information Act.
 
16.Give the Information Commissioner the power to order the release of information.
 
17. Expand Access to Information Legislation to any organization that spends taxpayers’ money.
 
18.Subject the exclusion of Cabinet confidences to review by the Information Commissioner in relation to Access to Information requests.
 
19.Oblige public officials to create the records necessary to document their actions and decisions.
 
20.Provide a general public interest override for all exemptions, so that the public interest is put before the secrecy of the government.
 
21.Ensure that all exemptions from the disclosure of government information are justified only on the basis of the harm or injury that would result from disclosure, not blanket exemption rules.
 .

Right, so. There was the Human Rights Act, which created the Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Tribunals. The HRC accepts complaints, and brings them to the HRT. The HRT interprets the Human Rights Act and is capable of handing out fines and other stuff.[1]



Now, beforehand, it was harassment to call a transman 'she', or a transwoman 'he', according to the Commission.[2] Which, well, it's not great for freedom of speech, but hey. Sacrifices must be made. At least it's only within business, education, contracts, housing. At least it's only limited speech.



With the advent of Bill C-16, gender identity and expression are added in, and they are self-identified. Meaning, I can require my teacher to refer to me with my own pronouns that I myself decide.

The rules and procedures of the tribunal shall be liberally and purposively interpreted and applied to...

-promote the fair, just and expeditious resolution of disputes, 

-allow parties to participate effectively in the process, whether or not they have a representative, 

-ensure that procedures, orders and directions are proportionate to the importance and complexity of the issues in the proceeding.


A3.2 Rules and procedures are not to be interpreted in a technical manner.


A3.3 Rules and procedures will be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the Human Rights Code.




II) HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL OF ONTARIO SPECIFIC RULES

A4 TRIBUNAL POWERS 


A4.1 The tribunal may exercise any of its powers at the request of a party, or on its own initiative, except where otherwise provided.


A4.2 The tribunal may vary or waive the application of any rule or procedure, on its own initiative or on the request of a party, except where to do so is prohibited by legislation or a specific rule.


1.6 The Tribunal will determine how a matter will be dealt with and may use procedures other than traditional adjudicative or adversarial procedures.


1.7 In order to provide for the fair, just and expeditious resolution of any matter before it the Tribunal may:

-lengthen or shorten any time limit in these Rules;

-add or remove a party;

-allow any filing to be amended;

-consolidate or hear Applications together;

This is the very definition of a kangaroo court. It's a runaway court, with way too much power. How are you Canadians okay with this?




[1] They can mandate a change of practice that if not held to will trigger contempt-of-court imprisonment.The Federal Court of Canada can also issue and enforce decisions made by the Tribunal if violations continue and imprison an offender for contempt of court if a decision continues to be disregarded.

Further, look at the above-quoted. They have full power to decide 'public interest remedies'. Any of them. Is that vague? It's meant to be.


[2]From the Human Rights Commission website: http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-because-gender-identity-and-gender-expression/7-forms-discrimination 

7.4 Gender-based harassment and sexual harassment

Gender-based harassment can involve: 

-Derogatory language toward trans people or trans communities 

-Insults, comments that ridicule, humiliate or demean people because of their gender identity or expression[44] 

-Refusing to refer to a person by their self-identified name and proper personal pronoun




[3] http://www.torontosun.com/2016/11/13/human-rights-commissioner-weighs-in-on-ze-and-hir HRC's Chief Commissioner Renu Mandhane:

•University of Toronto Professor Jordan Peterson is raising an argument that the OHRC is being used as a weapon to smother free speech. His university has said that the OHRC obliges him to address students by the pronoun of their choice. Must he?

“The OHRC recognizes the right to freedom of expression under the Charter. However, lawmakers and courts have found that no right is absolute. Expression may be limited where it is hate speech under criminal law; or amounts to harassment, discrimination, or creates a poisoned environment under the Code.”

•Is it a violation of the Code to not address people by their choice of pronoun? And if so, in what setting?

“Refusing to address a trans person by their chosen name and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity, or purposely misgendering, is discrimination when it takes place in a social area covered by the Code (employment, housing, and services like education).”

tl:dr: 
The HRT has gotten the ability to force people to use words they don't want to use. This is a bad precedent.
Also, they have way too much leeway within their rules, resulting in lots of power.

----------------------------------

Last year Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to legalize marijuana and many in the nation rejoiced. Regardless of your preference towards marijuana as an intoxicant, most at this point have come to the inevitable conclusion that the prohibition of pot is a fruitless enterprise that causes more damage than the drug itself. There is no shortage of studies that show that even fairly heavy marijuana use is relatively benign, especially when compared to the ravages of alcohol. Countless other studies have shown that mild marijuana use is nearly harmless. Gone are the days of the Heath study and the reefer madness propaganda of the 1960s, 70s, and 90s (the 1980s had other problems). Everyone has an Uncle Billy who loved cartoons, potato chips, and smelled funny. Instead of just say no, most reasonable people have agreed to “just say meh.” For all of you about to make the argument, “But you really shouldn't drink or smoke anything at all,” stop reading here. Get back on your high horse and ride off to wherever. You don't get to make decisions for the rest of society, and if there is one thing that the majority of civilization has come to a consensus on, it's that we're going to be smoking and drinking something.

**READ THIS IF YOU WANT BACKGROUND**

By this point the argument for legalization has been well made, but if I may quickly provide a brief summation, marijuana prohibition: creates the opportunity for criminal enterprise, eliminates the possibility for regulatory controls, dramatically increases the expense of police resources, eliminates the opportunity for taxation (over 85.2MM in tax dollars in Colorado in 2015 and 5 billion dollars in tourism dollars; way to go CO), increases the probability of youth usage because drug dealers don't ask for ID, increases the number of non-violent offenders in prison, is a horrific expense to the justice system and taxpayers as a whole, and causes alienation and distrust of the police, who are here to protect us, from a large group of individuals that are otherwise law abiding citizens. The only real argument against legalization is that people might toke and drive, but I've got news for you, several studies have shown marijuana doesn't impair you in the same way alcohol does so you're comparing apples to oranges. And guess what, weed is easier to get than beer or liquor in this country so anyone who is going to toke and drive is doing it already so we'll be no worse off. We might as well make millions in taxes and billions in tourism dollars to spend on educational programs to reduce usage like we did with cigarettes, all while increasing police safety and reducing access for teenagers. It's such a one-sided argument, I don't even really understand the other side. Most arguments I've read against marijuana legalization eventually boil down to: “It's illegal because it's always been illegal, it's wrong and always has been.” Well, has it?

The Canadian government first made marijuana illegal in 1908 as a response to rabid anti-Chinese attitudes among white Canadians. Following the completion of the trans-Canada railway in 1905, white Canadians in British Columbia suddenly had no interest in living near the thousands of Canadians of Chinese descent that have been living and building a life here for forty years. The completed railroad meant they no longer needed cheap labour that they could literally blow up at minimal expense. Racism in early twentieth century British Columbia was common. If you disagree with me, you don't know what you're talking about. I'd suggest you start with White Canada Forever, by Dr. Peter Ward; it's a cutting text that is dramatic in both it's clarity and simplicity: white Canadians saw Canada as a white country, Chinese labourers served a purpose and were transient labour. The historiography in this area is deep and while some facts are up for interpretation, the core values of the Canadians during this period are undisputed: anti-Chinese belief drove anti-drug law. Immigrants exporting immigrants: the story of white North America.

**MY POINT STARTS HERE**

OK. Now what? We can make millions in direct taxation while saving millions more in cost avoidance, but how are we going to do this? Creating a new infrastructure is terribly expensive and time consuming. My answer is Canada Post. That's right, Canada Post. This solution leverages an existing infrastructure that is currently under siege from the Internet and private parcel services, yet Canada Post exists in every city, town, province and territory. If there isn't a post office in your immediate vicinity just grow your pot in the woods, because you clearly live in the middle of goddamn nowhere (if you think the moose nearby is a snitch, you've had too much). With trillions of emails traversing the earth, the value of the individual letter has been reduced, yet the necessity of the mail for social security as well as for thousands of businesses that rely on the mail, continue to make it an essential service for the good of our economy. The current Canadian Postal Workers Union labour dispute with Canada Post strongly underlines the importance of the government pivoting this essential service into a new and innovative business opportunity. Canada Post will benefit from the influx of millions of tax dollars, a surplus of work for employees, and there will never be a labour dispute again: “What's that? Canada Post controls the weed supply. Give in. Just give in now.” Canada Post will check ID and make sure teenagers aren't smoking themselves into comas and prematurely preventing cognitive development, which is a symptom not generally seen in adults. Canada Post employees get paid a decent wage and will restrict access based on limits dictated by a central control system; this isn't going to be a marijuana free for all every day. That only happens one day in mid-April. And Canada Post already moves a controlled substance: the mail. The legal restrictions placed on the mail in this country are far greater than any other legal substance. Nobody ever went to jail for opening someone else's beer. Not to mention that Canadian farmers will have the opportunity to grow a new cash crop. I'd rather the money go to farmers and government employees than drug dealers. Even if Canada Post is uninterested in selling marijuana from their retail locations (although, buying weed from Shoppers Drug Mart would be a huge benefit for Shoppers, Lays, and anyone who makes chicken nuggets and pop tarts), acting as a centralized distributor would be no more complicated than shipping a few new packages to a few new destinations in towns that they go to already. 

Maybe Canada Post will have to hire a couple of thousand new employees. Great. Canada needs more middle class jobs to drive the economy. Maybe they'll have to construct new buildings and expand on their existing services. Great. Canada needs more construction projects for third party service providers and new opportunities for vendors to service reliable clients like Canada Post. The government has the opportunity to eliminate a huge portion of organized crime, significantly reduce youth access to intoxicants, generate millions of dollars to reduce debt, create thousands of jobs directly and thousands of jobs indirectly because all of those new middle class salaries will create more income for better paying working class salaries in the service and retail sectors. It will be the biggest economic win in the early 21st century and the toughest stroke against criminal enterprise since the end of alcohol prohibition 90 years ago. Tough on crime should mean making life tough on criminals, not zero tolerance laws committing non-violent offenders to years of incarceration for servicing a demand that should be legal if you believe in free enterprise.

We leverage existing infrastructure to service an existing industry, the money is already there waiting, the only questions are: how quickly can our nation pay down it's debts and how much money can we pour into our educational system to drive innovation in science, art, and literature. We waste billions of dollar on enforcement and let criminals enjoy billions in revenue. I say we take it back.

I have a bunch of roasted seeds and nuts I want to bring to Canada as gifts for a few friends. I know that raw seeds are prohibited from entering. I don't know if I needed to declare them to border security officer and if so how do I declare them? Since the ""seeds"" article in the CBSA Declaration Card is in the same place as the other food and meat products (which I don't have). And in the card we only have the option of saying ""Yes we have it"" or ""No we don't have it"". How do I declare that I have those roasted seeds and not other food and meat products?

Also, the Declaration Card also asks if I have ""commercial goods"". What exactly is ""commercial goods""? Does my packaged coffee classify as one?

Titled “Strengthening Canadians’ Security and Promotion Hunting and Recreational Shooting” seeks to create a definition for “hunting firearms”, amend the definition of “prohibited firearms” and to replace “restricted firearms” with “circumscribed firearms”, defined as all previous restricted firearms and all semi-automatic rifles and shotguns so that they can only be used at an approved range:

Definition 1
A hunting firearm is defined as any firearm with a smoothbore or striated barrel that is more than 470 mm long, in other words a shotgun or rifle. Semi-automatic weapons are not included in the definition of hunting firearm, with the exception of 22 calibre rim-fire semi-automatic rifles.
Definition 2
A circumscribed firearm is any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm, that has a barrel equal to or less than 470 millimetres, such as handguns or firearms that are capable of discharging centre-fire ammunition in a semi-automatic manner.
The updated bill, which was originally introduced in June of 2015 but did not pass second reading in the Senate, also seeks to achieve the following:

overhaul the current firearms program by prohibiting all firearms in Canada except hunting firearms, firearms used at shooting clubs, and collectors’ firearms, which receive special treatment;
redefine two of the three existing classes of firearms by making only hunting firearms legal and localizing the prohibition of restricted firearms;
limit the transport of circumscribed firearms to transporters — which have no interest other than providing secure transportation — thus controlling the movement of firearms in Canada;
replace the registration certificate with an inscription certificate. You can appreciate that the terms “registration” and “registered” have been used so often that we simply thought that using the term “inscription” would eliminate some anxiety. I think that using the term inscription does not evoke feelings of fear;
strengthen the role of the RCMP with a statutory provision;
undo all the provisions of Bill C-42, except for the prohibition on obtaining a licence to possess and acquire firearms following a domestic violence conviction
prohibit licensed firearms owners from storing centre-fire semi-automatic firearms in their own homes
Senator Hervieux-Payette, whose mandatory retirement is in less than two weeks, calls this bill “bold and progressive”. It’s bold, alright, but it’s anything but progressive. She also claims that she is not against firearms, but her actions speak louder than words. This is her last-ditch effort to have her name put on something before she is no longer eligible to hold a seat in the Senate, but nonetheless we should let her know what our words and actions are.

It has among the strictest liquor laws in the world. It is relatively difficult and expensive to buy (compared to the rest of the world), prohibited to drink anywhere but a licensed establishment or in a private home, and even patios are often off limits. Recently we have seen provinces ban smoking everywhere. You can't even smoke in your own car now in some cases. Ontario even considered banning smoking outdoors. The provinces have all placed restrictions on vaping without even bothering to determine if it's safe or not first. They treat vaping just like smoking. 

So the government is planning to legalize marijuana. The media has been coming out with stories dreaming of a tourism boom, as Americans flock north to smoke pot. But they haven't thought it through. Trudeau isn't a hippie. He put a former police chief in charge of the legalization framework. He keeps talking about 'protecting the children' and 'safety' and increasing criminal penalties. Premiers and unions are planning to limit sales to government stores like the LCBO. There is no talk, from anyone with any power, about creating an actual free market for marijuana, allowing marijuana cafés, marijuana bars, or allowing people to smoke marijuana on patios or anywhere in public. In fact, people on reddit are already whining that they don't want to have to smell marijuana as they walk down the street. There are a lot of people like that in Canada, and politicians agree with them. The only place we'll be able to use marijuana will probably be inside our homes, and only if no kids are there. 

So where are these hordes of American tourists going to be allowed to smoke pot? In their hotels? No, there's no smoking allowed in hotels anymore. In their cars? Their cars will get seized. On the street? At the beach? In parks? They'll get ticketed for that.

When Americans discover what 'legalization' really means, they won't be coming here.   ",canada,Why do people assume marijuana legalization will lead to a tourism boom?

Here, Randall Hansen writes that anti-liberal attitudes need to be challenged whatever their source – minorities who oppose liberal values or Europeans who scapegoat Muslims. He concludes that focus should also be on employment: immigration works only when immigrants work.
> 
> Immigration is among the defining issues of our time. For years, UK voters have ranked it one of the ‘most important issues facing the country’. As of December 2015, immigration was ranked the most important: 63 per cent of respondents indicated immigration, far ahead of health (39 per cent) and the economy (33 per cent). Anti-immigrant parties in the UK, France, and Denmark enjoy levels of support of around 25 per cent. The mass influx of refugees and asylum seekers over the second half of 2015 rejuvenated the moribund anti-Islamic Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident (PEGIDA) movement in Germany, it increased the far right’s share of the vote to over 30 per cent in Austrian elections and helped bring the nationalist right to power in Poland.
> 
> Anti-immigration sentiment is partly founded, particularly in Eastern Europe, on xenophobia and anti-Islamic sentiment, but opponents of immigration raise two concerns that cannot be dismissed. First, they argue that immigration disproportionately penalises the poorest members of society, as unskilled migration forced workers’ wages down. Second, it is said that when migration originates in Middle Eastern and North African countries, it brings to Europe individuals at odds with mainstream values on women, sexual minorities, and free speech. The great upsurge in refugees to Germany, Austria, and Sweden have obviously intensified the second concern, as did the coordinated assaults on women in central Cologne and in other German cities on New Year’s Eve.
> 
> Taking the first argument first, unskilled immigration does push workers’ wages down, but not by much, and this loss is more than compensated by an overall increase in wages. From 1997 to 2005, a time of large-scale immigration to the UK, wages of the lowest percentile fell by approximately £39per year, while wages overall increased by £332. Tax and spending adjustments could thus transfer the wage loss back to that bottom percentile, and even increase their wages, while leaving a net wage gain from immigration. Immigration, even unskilled immigration, can pay.
> 
> Such are the economic issues at stake. But for many – frankly, too many – immigration is a question of the second concern: identity and culture. Since 11 September 2001, the global immigration debate has centred, often to an excessive degree, on Muslims and Islam, and it has occurred against the backdrop of an upsurge in anti-Islamic sentiment and a mobilization by some political parties around the threat posed by Islam to Europe and European values.
> 
> As too many Europeans have rejected Muslims, too many Muslims in Europe have rejected liberalism. A depressingly familiar dynamic emerged in the 1988/1989 Rushdie Affair and continued through to the Danish cartoon controversy of 2006 and the Charlie Hebdo murders of 2015. In all three cases, artists produced works deemed by some (mostly) Muslims as offensive to Islam. Protests, threats and violence followed, and significant numbers of commentators argued that, though they in principle supported free speech, artists and intellectuals should avoid offending Muslims.
> 
> So where does this leave Britain and Europe? Coming back to the economics, the case in favour of skilled immigration is clear, and no one can rationally dispute it. Unskilled immigration is more complicated, as it can impose a fiscal cost on society, but still produces economic benefits. These can only, however, be tapped if three conditions are in place. First, Britons and other Europeans must believe that their governments can manage immigration. When this perception vanishes – as it did in Germany between the 1990s and today, in the UK in the later 1990s and today, and in the United States in the early 1990s and the mid-2000s – public support for immigration collapses. It is therefore essential that the European Union regains control over its external borders.
> 
> Second, as migration can oscillate easily between a (low) net benefit to a (low) net cost, it is essential to bring and to keep immigrants in work. Training and education are of course essential, but welfare policy also plays a role: income assistance for the unemployed cannot be set above the market wage. Doing so can only encourage unemployment, as William Beveridge, who can hardly be qualified as a reactionary, recognised.
> 
> Third, anti-liberal action has to be challenged, whatever its source. To tackle Islamophobia, existing legal prohibitions on anti-Muslim discrimination should be robustly applied and should be seen to be applied. Far-right politicians and a few mainstream commentators, who have constructed Muslims as essentially violent and extremist, need to be confronted. The arguments are well-known and well-rehearsed, but they need to be repeated: acts of violence are committed by a tiny minority, and we are too inclined in the case of Muslims to associate such violence with the faith itself or with all its believers. By contrast, when Jews or Christians commit acts of violence, we instinctively regard them as lunatics who are unrepresentative of their faith.[1] Few people believe that Christian fundamentalists shouting ‘God hates fags’ speak for the whole of Christianity.
> 
> At the same time, European and British Muslims, like everyone else, need to respect the rules of the liberal game: respect for gender equality (the harassment of women, of the sort seen in Cologne, cannot be tolerated), rights of sexual minorities (the attitudes of some Muslim communities, notably British, towards LGBT people are thoroughly retrograde), and a right of free speech. In the last, the oft-made suggestion that publications of caricatures of the Islamic Prophet Muhammed go beyond the viable limits of free speech, should be treated as it is: absurd.
> 
> The right to mock religion, any religion, is so within the bounds of acceptable speech that the fact that there is a debate at all is mystifying. To be sure, publishing crude caricatures of the Prophet is disrespectful and offensive. Respect, however, is a matter of choice and cannot be mandated. Pious Muslims certainly do not respect philanderers, men who enjoy the delights of gay saunas, or women who like a drink.[2] To suggest otherwise, to imply that Muslims should be given a sort of ‘pass’ in matters of free speech, is not only wrong but it is deeply condescending, above all to moderate Muslims, as it suggests that they are somehow not quite as good as the rest of us, that they need to be coddled and protected from offensive speech, and that they cannot grasp basic liberal principles. No less a thinker than the political philosopher Charles Taylor has confidently stated that Muslims cannot understand the distinction between religion and politics. It is hard to imagine a more patronizing statement.
> 
> In short, a Britain and Europe of open but managed borders, high immigration and high employment, and a single liberal framework applying to diverse religions can allow European governments to welcome immigrants whilst maintaining public support. The most important issue is not, however, culture. It is rather cash: immigration can only work when immigrants work.

We begin our analysis on page 3 which provides the following:

>Article QQ.A.5: {General Provisions / Nature and Scope of Obligations}

>Each Party shall give effect to the provisions of this Chapter. A Party may, but shall not be obliged to, provide more extensive protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights under its law than is required by this Chapter, provided that such protection and enforcement does not contravene the provisions of this Chapter.

Some people question whether or not countries have to actually implement all or some of the provisions in the chapter. This article seems to be clear that all provisions must be implemented and that the only flexibility is if countries want to implement more strict laws that go above and beyond this agreement. It isn’t necessary, but this agreement says that there is no harm in that so long as the restrictions in the agreement aren’t circumvented in any way.

**Ratification of Other Treaties:**

Continuing on page 4, we see the following:

>2. Each Party shall ratify or accede to each of the following agreements, where it is
not already a Party to such agreement, by the date of entry into force of this Agreement for
the Party concerned:

>(e) WIPO Copyright Treaty (1996); and

>(f) WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (1996).

In our previous analysis, we made the following notes:
While this is one of a number of treaties this agreement demands members to adopt, we have some familiarity with the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) treaties. The treaty was controversial for a host of reasons including the prohibition of circumvention of things like Digital rights Management (DRM). Why this is controversial is the fact that it doesn’t take into account legal exceptions various countries have like Fair Dealing (Canada) or Fair Use (US). the treaty would give rise to the more famous and more controversial US law known as the Digital Millennium Copyright act (DMCA). This can be found on the Wikipedia entry of the treaty. Another controversy of WIPO was the numerous attempts to bring in what is known as the broadcasting treaty. What the treaty would have done is create a new layer of copyright over the transmission of content. So, if a broadcaster airs something that is in the public domain, the broadcaster would have exclusive rights of that work regardless if they played a role in the creation of that content. One posting about this can be found on the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Suffice to say, WIPO has had many controversies in the past.

The current provision does not move the needle in any direction from the previous draft, so our comments are pretty much the same.

**Unmasking of Domain Name Owners:**

Moving on to page 12, we found the following:

>Article QQ.C.12: {Domain Name Cybersquatting}

>1. In connection with each Party’s system for the management of its country-code toplevel domain (ccTLD) domain names, the following shall be available:

>(a) an appropriate procedure for the settlement of disputes, based on, or modelled along the same lines as, the principles established in the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, or that is: (i) designed to resolve disputes expeditiously and at low cost, (ii) fair and equitable, (iii) not overly burdensome, and (iv) does not preclude resort to court litigation; and

>(b) online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact information concerning domain-name registrants;

>in accordance with each Party’s laws and, where applicable, relevant administrator policies regarding protection of privacy and personal data.

>2. In connection with each Party’s system for the management of ccTLD domain names, appropriate remedies, shall be available, at least in cases where a person registers or holds, with a bad faith intent to profit, a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark.

The idea here is that if you register a domain name, you can no longer be officially anonymous. This would affect countries like Canada that allow domain name owners to refuse to reveal their identity based on privacy concerns. This provision would remove that kind of protection. There is a provision that suggests the information must be in accordance to privacy laws, but that would have more to do with social insurance numbers rather than contact information.

**The Creation of a TPP Commission:**

Something we either didn’t catch previously or something that is new is something called the “TPP Commission”. There is only one mention of it in the chapter and that is found on page 26 while discussing pharmaceuticals:

>3. Recognizing that international and domestic regulation of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic is in a formative stage and that market circumstances may evolve over time, the Parties shall consult after 10 years, or as otherwise decided by the TPP Commission, to review the period of exclusivity provided in paragraph 1 and the scope of application provided in paragraph 2, with a view to providing effective incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic, as well as with a view to facilitating the timely availability of follow-on biosimilars, and to ensuring that the scope of application remains consistent with international developments regarding approval of additional categories of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic.

So, apparently, the TPP Commission is to watch over the pharmaceutical industry and direct countries (AKA “parties”) as to when to meet to discuss regulations as it pertains to the markets should a discussion need to take place outside of the 10 year. This paragraph suggests that the TPP Commission is also an international body that oversees many countries and how the government regulates themselves. What else would the TPP Commission be tasked to do? We don’t know. This is the only mention of it in the entire chapter. It does raise a number of troubling thoughts, however. Who would run the TPP Commission? Who would be appointed or elected to the TPP Commission? Is this part of the international tribunal system that has been previously mentioned from past leaks? Will the TPP Commission enforce compliance for the laws mentioned in the TPP? Even though it’s not mentioned anywhere else in this chapter, it could very well still affect how countries implement laws related to copyright in some kind of core text or general provisions section that has yet to be leaked or otherwise disclosed.

**Length of Copyright:**

Moving on to page 31, we see the following:

>Article QQ.G.6: {Term of Protection for Copyright and Related Rights}

>Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance, or phonogram is to be calculated:
(a) on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death[80]; and

>(b) on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:

>(i) not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication of the work, performance, or phonogram; or

>(ii) failing such authorized publication within 25 years from the creation of the work, performance, or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance, or phonogram.

The footnote for 80 is as follows:
80 The Parties understand that if a Party provides its nationals a term of copyright protection that exceeds life of the author plus 70 years, nothing in this Article or Article QQ.A.9 shall preclude that Party from applying Article 7.8 of the Berne Convention with respect to the term in excess of the term provided in QQ.G.6(a) of protection for works of another Party.

So, in short, the new floor for copyright terms is now life plus 70 years. If a countries copyright term is longer, then that does not run afoul of the TPP. We saw this length being debated in the previous draft and the length went as high as life plus 100 years. It would appear that the length chosen was the middle ground (the choices being life plus 50 years, 70 years, or 100 years). Interesting to say the least, but for many countries, this represents a copyright term extension.

**Criminal Liability Added to Anti-Circumvention Laws:**

Starting on page 33, we find the following:

>Article QQ.G.10: {Technological Protection Measures}

>(a) In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person who:

>(i) knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know, circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram90; or

>(ii) manufactures, imports, distributes , offers for sale or rental to the public, or otherwise provides devices, products, or components, or offers to the public or provides services, that:

>(A) are promoted, advertised, or otherwise marketed by that person for the purpose of circumventing any effective technological measure;

>(B) have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent any effective technological measure; or

>(C) are primarily designed, produced, or performed for the purpose of circumventing any effective technological measure, shall be liable and subject to the remedies set out in Article QQ.H.4.17(Civil Judicial Proceedings relating to TPMs and RMIs).

>Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied where any person is found to have engaged wilfully and for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain in any of the above activities.

One thing to note is the fact that the language of “commercial scale” is nowhere to be found in this instance. Instead, we see the terms “commercial advantage” and “financial gain”. The placement of this is extremely vague. Does the commercial advantage have to relate explicitly to the alleged infringement or could it be indirectly related in some way to trigger criminal charges? In any event, this appears to be a move away from targeting commercial piracy to encompass many more people than what is the norms in many countries. Anti-circumvention, for some countries, isn’t anything new (like the US). What may be new is the added element of criminal liability added over top of the charges where it was typically civil liability before.

**“Deterrent” Level Liabilities:**

Moving on to page 37, we see the following language:

>Article QQ.H.1: {General Enforcement}

>1. Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this section, are available under its law so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies which constitute a deterrent to future infringements.

What this means exactly is unclear. What constitutes deterrent level? What might be likely is statutory damages. As we’ve seen in the US, statutory damages can mean that you get sued for millions of dollars for sharing a dozen or so songs without authorization. There is still debate as to how that conforms to the constitution. Still, that could be what negotiators have in mind here.

**Government Mandated Spying on Copyright Infringement:**

Moving onto page 39:

>Article QQ.H.3: {Enforcement Practices With Respect to Intellectual Property Rights}



>2. Each Party recognizes the importance of collecting and analyzing statistical data and other relevant information concerning intellectual property rights infringements as well as collecting information on best practices to prevent and combat infringements.

>3. Each Party shall publish or otherwise make available to the public information on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil, administrative and criminal systems, such as statistical information that the Party may collect for such purposes.

Given the very general term of infringement, this would almost suggest that governments are being mandated to monitor the Internet directly for copyright infringement among other things. This represents the outsourcing of something major copyright holders pay for directly onto the government (and thus, taxpayers).

**Unlimited Damages:**

On Page 40, we see the following:

>2. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings its judicial authorities have the authority at least to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person’s intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity.

>3. At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer, at least as described in paragraph 2, to pay the right holder the infringer’s profits that are attributable to the infringement.

>4. In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 2, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, inter alia, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price.

What we’re mainly focusing in on is the last paragraph – specifically this: “any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits”. What is considered “lost profits”? How can this be measured? The simple answer is that this is not necessarily a calculable thing. Instead, this is simply a number that can be made up by rights holders (which is not unheard of by any means). Because the rights holders have the ability to pick any number and call it “lost profits”, then the damages could be anything. The sky is the limit here so far as the rightsholders are concerned. For example, a rights holder could sue an alleged infringer for downloading Justin Beiber music. When asked, the rightsholder could say that the lost profits are $500 billion. Who’s to say that copyright won’t be extended in the future? Who’s to say that inflation might take over in the future? Who’s to say that Justin Beiber music won’t become a national currency in a couple of countries? These provisions could set up this sort of scenario. Reality is just a distraction, after all.

To add to the unlimited damages, there is this found in page 41:

>9. Pre-established damages under paragraphs (7) and (8) shall be set out in an amount that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements.

>10. In awarding additional damages under paragraphs (7) and (8), judicial authorities shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they consider appropriate, having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of the infringing conduct and the need to deter similar infringements in the future.

So, if the rights holder in question feels like piling on even more damages. They can elect to impose damages that would be “deterring future infringements”. So, maybe $500 billion won’t teach the infringer a lesson. Maybe it would be better to fine the person $1 Trillion just to drive home the message.

**Damages and Destruction of TPM Circumvention:**

On page 42, we see the following:

>17. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in Article QQ.G.10 (TPMs) and Article QQ.G.12 (RMI), each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall, at least, have the authority to:

>(a) impose provisional measures, including seizure or other taking into custody of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity;

>(b) order the type of damages available for copyright infringement, as provided under its regime in accordance with Article QQ.H.4;

>(c) order court costs, fees, or expenses as provided for under Article QQ.H.4.11; and

>(d) order the destruction of devices and products found to be involved in the prohibited activity.

The problem here is that if the “product” happens to be an open source project that has been released into the public online, how is it possible to even carry through a “destruction” order?

**Authority to Enforce Copyright Laws Even Before Infringement Takes Place:**

On page 43, we see the following:

>Article QQ.H.5: {Provisional Measures}

>1. Each Party’s authorities shall act on requests for relief in respect of any intellectual property right inaudita altera parte expeditiously in accordance with the Party’s judicial rules.

>2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the applicant, with respect to provisional measures in respect of any intellectual property right, to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures.

>3. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into custody of suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement.

In other words, authorities can target you if you have infringed on copyright, or if they believe infringement is “imminent”. This, of course, raises a whole host of problems because under what circumstances can authorities take you down when you are accused of being about to infringe on copyright? The fact that you don’t even have to infringe on copyright to have your door busted down by the feds for copyright infringement raises a number of red flags.

**Seizing Your Cellphone at the Border:**

On the same page (43), we also see the following:

>Article QQ.H.6: {Special Requirements related to Border Measures}

>1. Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of, or to detain, any suspect counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark, or pirated copyright goods that are imported123 into the territory of the Party.


>5. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.


>6. Without prejudice to a Party’s laws pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality of information, where its competent authorities have detained or suspended the release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, a Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without undue delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee, or importer, a description of the goods, quantity of the goods, and, if known, the country of origin of the goods. Where a Party does not provide such authority to its competent authorities when suspect goods are detained or suspended from release, it shall provide at least in cases of imported goods, its competent authorities with the authority to provide the foregoing information to the right holder normally within 30 days of the seizure or determination that the goods are counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods.

>7. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures
ex officio with respect to goods under customs control129 that are:

>(a) imported;

>(b) destined for export; or

>(c) in-transit,

>and that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods.

So, if your cell phone is suspected of containing copyright infringing content, whether it is being brought in the country, brought out, or in transit between countries, authorities can seize it and alert copyright holders immediately.
Should you get caught with allegedly infringing content on your cellphone, authorities have the right to fine and administer penalties against you:

>8. Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine, within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the procedures described under Article QQ.H.6.(1), QQ.H.6.6(a) and QQ.H.6.6(b)and if applicable QQ.H.6.6(c), whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right133. Where a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the infringing goods, following a determination that the goods are infringing.

Then, what happens to your cellphone after you get questioned? Well, authorities can destroy it of course:

>9. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to order the destruction of goods following a determination that the goods are infringing. In cases where such goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, such goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder.

So, who pays for the destruction or holding of your cellphone? Naturally, you do:

>10. Where a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described in this Article, an application fee, storage fee, or destruction fee, such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures.

The question is, are exceptions to this? Isn’t it a little extreme to smash your cellphone? Well, there is one exception:

>11. Each Party shall include in the application of this Article goods of a commercial nature sent in small consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travelers’ personal luggage

So, if you have your cellphone in your luggage somewhere, then maybe it’ll get a pass. Of course, how many people pack their cellphone in their suitcase while traveling? Are there any other exceptions to this rule? None that we can tell.

**Anti-Cam Laws:**

Buried in page 46 is the following:

>4. Recognizing the need to address the unauthorized copying140 of a cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognizing the need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum include but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and penalties.

Oh, and, of course, aiding and abetting is out of the question too:

>5. With respect to the offenses for which this Article requires the Parties to provide for criminal procedures and penalties, Parties shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law.

Are you going to jail if you are camming a movie? According to page 47, yup:

>6. With respect to the offences described in Article QQ.H.7 (1)-(5) above, each Party shall provide:

>(a) penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to future acts of infringement, consistently with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a corresponding gravity;

**Site Blocking and Traffic Shaping**

On page 51, we find the following:

>1. The Parties recognize the importance of facilitating the continued development of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a manner consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action by rights holders against copyright infringement158 covered under this Chapter that occurs in the online environment. Accordingly, each Party shall ensure that legal remedies are available for rights holders to address such infringement and shall establish or maintain appropriate safe harbors in respect of online services that are Internet Service Providers. This framework of legal remedies and safe harbors shall include:

>(a) legal incentives for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with copyright owners to deter the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take other action to deter the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and

>(b) limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate, or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.

In other words, ISPs may not necessarily be on the hook for infringement of their users, but they do need to take measures to prevent the transmission and storage of copyright infringing content. Judging by the language here, this could include site blocking and traffic shaping (which would fit the bill here).
While, on the surface, that seems to simply apply to your standard ISP, a footnote would suggest that the same applies for services like VPNs as well:
For the purposes of this Section, “ Internet service provider” means:

>(a) A provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, undertaking the function in paragraph 2(a);

>(b) A provider of online services undertaking the functions in paragraphs 2(c) or (d).

**Notice and Takedown:**

On page 52, we see the notice and takedown provisions:

>3. To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or alternatively, shall provide for circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b):

>(a) With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) above, such conditions shall include a requirement for Internet service providers to expeditiously remove or disable access to material residing on their networks or systems upon obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, such as through receiving a notice of alleged infringement from the right holder or a person authorized to act on its behalf,

>(b) An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to material in good faith pursuant to and consistent with sub-paragraph (a) shall be exempt from any liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable steps in advance or promptly after to notify the person whose material is removed or disabled.

What this provision would do is completely eradicate the notice-and-notice system that has proven to be effective in Canada and replace it with the much more draconian (in comparison) notice-and-takedown system. The former system is more of an innocent until proven guilty approach. The latter is a guilty until proven innocent approach. For countries that do not have a notice-and-takedown system, this is little more than importing American laws into other countries legal systems.

**No Obligation for ISPs to Monitor Networks:**

On page 53, we noticed that ISPs themselves won’t be directly involved in the surveillance of their networks:

>6. Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 may not be conditioned on the Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.

So, ISPs are off the hook when it comes to actively monitoring their networks. As we discussed earlier, that role appears to be being placed on the government instead.
Forcing ISPs to Hand Over Customer Information
On the same page (53), we see that another US style enforcement law is being pushed:

>7. Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process and privacy, enabling a copyright owner who has made a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, where such information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing such copyright.

If a copyright holder accuses of an IP address of copyright infringement, then the ISP is obliged to hand the subscribers information over. A few things are notably absent here. For one, there is no compensation for the ISP to look up subscriber information. For another, there is no mention of court oversight here. While discover of an IP address is common practice in the US, it is typically done through a judge. That judicial oversight appears to be stripped away in this case. This allows rights holders to be prosecutor, judge and jury over accusations of infringement because they have free reign to threaten people en-mass directly.

**Coming Into Force:**

Towards the end of this agreement, we see the following on page 54:

>1. Except as otherwise provided in QQ.A.10bis and paragraphs 2-4, each Party shall give effect to the provisions of this Chapter on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

So, all provisions must be adopted once this deal is ratified.
No Undercutting These Provisions
Furthermore, if a country, say, comes to their senses and realizes that one of these things is questionable, the country cannot undo the damage caused by that law:

>2. During the relevant periods set out below, a Party shall not amend an existing measure or adopt a new measure that is less consistent with its obligations under the provisions referenced below for that Party than relevant measures that are in effect as of the date of signature of this Agreement. This provision does not affect the rights and obligations of a Party under an international agreement to which it and another Party are party.

This shows that this is truly and all or nothing approach.

**Time Limit:**

Going even further, there is even a time limit to how long a country has to implement these laws:

>4. With regard to obligations subject to a transition period, a Party shall fully implement its obligations under the provisions of this Chapter no later than the expiration of the relevant time period specified below, which begins on the date of entry into force of the Agreement for that Party.

Interestingly, though, these time limits only apply to certain countries. These countries are: Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, and Viet Nam. Each country has a large list of provisions and deadlines to meet.
The agreement ends with county specific obligations. Those countries include: New Zealand, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, and Peru (twice for some reason).

Final Thoughts:

Consumer and digital rights organizations have called this final draft everything that they have feared coming to fruition. The EFF states that the leaked copy we just analyzed “confirms our worst fears about the agreement, and dashes the few hopes that we held out that its most onerous provisions wouldn’t survive to the end of the negotiations.”
From a consumer rights perspective, the EFF is correct on that assessment. If you support digital rights, this agreement represents a direct assault. It strips away many protections consumers have been given and implements laws that are extremely anti-consumer. Moreover, it’s extremely difficult to see how this is a trade agreement because there’s very little about this chapter that has to do with international trade. Instead, it seems to be more of a method to import undesirable laws from an international body, circumventing the standard methods of lawmaking (namely governmental representatives of the people writing the laws). At this point, making the argument that the TPP is simply about international trade after all of this is a position that is so difficult to maintain, it borders on extreme delusion. This agreement is about lawmaking. Everything above is either mostly about lawmaking, or is exclusively about lawmaking. The laws being proposed here is about serving corporate interests behind closed doors – a departure of what democracy is all about.

You have just won a stunning victory in Canada’s national elections, taking the Liberal party from the third-largest party in parliament to being its largest in a huge reversal of the 2011 election. This was made possible thanks to Canadian voters trusting your many pledges given throughout this campaign: 


You promised to make sure that this election will have been the last to be conducted under the outdated First-Past-the-Post system.


You promised to reverse Mr. Harper’s cuts to scientific research. 


You promised to take better care of our veterans. 


You promised to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security to combat economic hardships among Canadian seniors. 


You promised to end the expensive and counter-productive prohibition on marijuana.
 

You promised to fix bill C-51 and add much-needed oversight.


And while you did not take a firm stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you criticized its lack of transparency. Therefore, the only fair thing to do would be to release the full details of this trade treaty as soon as possible in order to give Canadians the time to fully understand its potential advantages and disadvantages (e.g. restricting the availability of inexpensive generic medicines). This way, Canadians will be able to form a consensus, and inform our members of parliament about whether we would like them to sign this treaty or not. 


Now that you will be able to form a majority-government with a clear mandate from Canadian voters, it is crucial that you move to implement the pledges mentioned above (and others you made during the campaign) without delay. Canadian voters believed your message of building a Canada with a brighter future and have entrusted you to realize that vision. You have an opportunity to build a legacy of leadership rivaled by few others in Canadian history. However, after years of broken promises the Canadian public is wary of the Liberal party having “campaigned from the left, and governing from the right”. We are tired of cynical politicians saying all the right things, only to turn their backs on the public as soon as they are in power. We want to believe in your vision of a prosperous Canada leading the world, don’t let us down Mr. Trudeau.

That seems extraordinarily expansive to me; I can't see how it wouldn't give the provinces the power to prohibit almost any behaviour, which I'm fairly sure they don't have.

Edit: I *think* Quebec doesn't prohibit young people from possessing alcohol.

Everyone eligible to vote must have **three consecutive hours** to cast their vote on Election Day. If an employee's hours of work do not allow for three consecutive hours to vote during the electoral polling hours, the employer must give the employee time off to vote. The employee must be paid his or her regular wage during the time off for voting. Employers **cannot** require the employee to use a vacation day and are also prohibited from penalizing an employee in any way from taking time off to vote.

Two examples help illustrate when an employer is required to give an employee time off to vote.

**1. Time off Required**

An employee resides in a riding that has voting hours from 9:30 am to 9:30 pm. The employee's shift is 11 am to 7 pm.

This employee does not have three consecutive hours off work to vote when the polls are open because the employee is only off work during polling hours for 1.5 hours in the morning and 2.5 hours in the afternoon.

The employer, however, **has the discretion to decide when the time off will be given** and can require the employee to take 30 minutes off work to vote during the last 30 minutes of the employee's shift (rather than 1.5 hours off in the morning) since that will be least disruptive to the employer.

**2. Time off not Required**

A different employee with the same employer and in the same riding has a shift from 9 am to 5 pm.

This employee has more than three consecutive hours after work to vote during polling hours. Accordingly, this employee does not have to be provided with time off to vote during the work day.

Transportation Industry Exemption

An exemption applies if the employer is in the transportation industry. For the exemption to apply all four of the below criteria must be met:

* The employer is a company that transports goods or passengers by land, air or water;
* The employee is employed outside his or her polling division;
* The employee is employed in the operation of a means of transportation; and
* The time off cannot be allowed without interfering with the transportation service.

**Penalties**

Employers who fail to give employees time off to vote or fail to pay employees as required by the Elections Act are in breach of the Act. Employers could face a fine of up to $2,000, three months imprisonment, or both for each violation of the Act.",canada,PSA: Federal election 2015 – employee time off to vote,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3nyrs8/psa_federal_election_2015_employee_time_off_to/

**On Healthcare:**

* Harper is cutting the ""jugular of public health care,"". To date, the Harper government has refused to meet with premiers to negotiate a new accord. Instead, the federal government plans to cut $36 billion over 10 years from public health care and walk away from its responsibilities to ensure equal access to all Canadians, which could lead to mass privatization.

* Harper government derailed the national pharmaceutical strategy contained in the 2004 Health Accord. As the Health Council pointed out, the national pharmaceutical strategy was integral to the renewal and sustainability of the entire health care system. http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/04/17/by_closing_the_national_health_council_stephen_harper_is_abandoning_national_medicare.html

* Canadian Medical Association Journal - Harper government has dithered on public health measures of glaringly
obvious benefit, such as tobacco control and asbestos elimination; ignored and disbanded expert advisory panels on health issues; weakened the authority of the public health agency; muzzled scientists; eliminated the long form census, the best source of information on regional disparities relevant to health; and eroded research support, while increasingly tying what remains to business interests rather than health benefits. By all appearances, the federal government seems to be trying to get itself out of the health care business. It cannot. Many essential aspects of health care are a federal responsibility, and our biggest, most complex problems in the health care system cannot be solved without federal leadership. Without such leadership, Canadians will continue to suffer.
http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2015/08/17/cmaj.150896.full.pdf

* After 2017, Canada Health Transfers to be much lower than previously paid, putting real struggle on provincial health care across Canada. **After 2017, minimum three percent rate is below the funding increases of the last 10 years.  What this means is that the growth of transfer payments will not likely keep up with the possible continued growth in healthcare costs.** In other words, provinces and territories will see funding from the federal government grow at a slower rate than previously.  Increases above three percent will also be less predictable and less stable, as they will be tied to increases in GDP above three percent. The bottom line: Given population growth and inflation, federal health cash transfer growth of only three percent after 2017 essentially means a freeze in real per capita health transfers.

**Two tiered citizenship now in Canada:**

* As a result of this new law, dual citizens and people who have immigrated to Canada can have their citizenship taken away while other Canadians cannot. Bill C-24 could easily be used against non-terrorists—for example, a journalist who is convicted of a “terrorism offence” in another country for reporting on human rights violations by the government. https://bccla.org/2015/06/its-official-second-class-citizenship-goes-into-effect/

* Harper turns 863,000 Canadians into second-class citizens. ""Say you were born in the United Kingdom, like me and 126,000 other Canadians, and have dual citizenship. Even if you’ve never lived and never intend to live in the U.K., you can now be deported if government thinks it has cause. In fact, the new rules say that all you have to do to merit the asterisk is have a claim to citizenship elsewhere, so anybody with a grandparent born in the U.K. likely falls into this category. Overnight, we have some Canadians discovering they suddenly have fewer rights as citizens than, say, native-born career criminals.""
http://www.vancouversun.com/stephen+hume+harper+turns+canadians+into+second+class+citizens/11410121/story.html?__lsa=a606-1c0d

* I always knew I wasn’t an “old-stock” Canadian. But I was very shocked when one day I woke up and discovered that thanks to Bill C-24 I had somehow become a second-class Canadian. Old age security. All you have to do is look at the application form and you will see that for non-Canadian born citizens proof of our arrival and citizenship is not enough to qualify. Canadians born here are not asked to document every address they have ever lived at in order to get OAS. Are we assumed to be cheats?
http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/10/01/how-i-became-a-second-class-canadian.html

*  It means that government would reward them citizenship for “good behavior” and could take it away for “bad behavior”. This is a form of “punishment,” and in fact, an unnecessary punishment, especially when there are other avenues to deal with the so-called “bad behavior”. **The introduction of citizenship as merely a privilege, and not a right comes from the negative perception that immigrants are cheaters**. It constructs the idea that immigrants, refugees, foreign workers, and naturalized citizens are terrorists or criminals and need to be deported to their “home countries.”

It is an attempt to guarantee public ignorance.""*** Over the last few years, the government of Canada — led by Stephen Harper — has made it harder and harder for publicly financed scientists to communicate with the public and with other scientists. It began badly enough in 2008 when scientists working for Environment Canada, the federal agency, were told to refer all queries to departmental communications officers. Now the government is doing all it can to monitor and restrict the flow of scientific information, especially concerning research into climate change, fisheries and anything to do with the Alberta tar sands — source of the diluted bitumen that would flow through the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Journalists find themselves unable to reach government scientists; the scientists themselves have organized public protests.

* ""The Harper years have seen a subtle darkening of Canadian life,"" writes Stephen Marche, a Canadian who has regular columns in both Esquire and the National Post. [...] The darkness has resulted, organically, in one of the most scandal-plagued administrations in Canadian history. [...] Americans have traditionally looked to Canada as a liberal haven, with gun control, universal health care and good public education,"" says Marche. ""But the nine and half years of Mr. Harper’s tenure have seen the slow-motion erosion of that reputation for open, responsible government. His stance has been a know-nothing conservatism, applied broadly and effectively.""

Harper:  Back in the minority government era I was not terribly unhappy with Harper, he actually did two things I agreed with, lowered the GST twice (the GST is the most indiscriminate and regressive tax in Canadian history) and introducing the Universal Child Care Benefit, which is a model program for how social assistance should work (everyone gets it, no insane restrictions, and it's not a tax writeoff but actually something that would benefit actual poor people).

Unfortunately everything they have done since then has been a disaster.  Harper's debate performance did not even mention any of the things he did that I actually liked, and he doubled down on everything I hate about the man and defended his record and even refused to apologize when asked to.  



Economy Section: F

Harper has no plan on how to create jobs in Canada.  All the avenues of job creation he shot down (no stimulus spending, no trade barriers to protect or encourage manufacturing, no investment in education or small business) his economic plan essentially is let's just wait for resource prices to go back up and tighten our belts until then.  He literally boasted about how many trade agreements he had signed as ""Prime Minster"", when it is trade agreements which caused the collapse of Canadian manufacturing in the first place.



Environment Section: F

The Conservative party is openly hostile to environmentalism so I don't think this is even a bad thing for Harper, he won't lose any votes over this except mine I guess, but couldn't he toss me a bone or something?  I don't like Mulcair's position on pipelines either but at least he was willing to BS me by saying he'll at least consider saying no or try and put some safety requirements or oversight.  As a British Columbian, a huge part of our economy is based on our oceans not being polluted crapholes (fishing and tourism are huge parts of the BC economy).



Democracy Section: F

Harper's stated position was shown to be BS within five minutes of stating it, on the Senate, on the ""Fair Elections Act"", on changing First Past the Post, I don't think he's even trying anymore.  And to be fair I don't think this will hurt him either, I don't think his base cares if poor people can't vote, but I think his position was cynical and kind of scary.



Foreign Affairs: F

Canada's foreign affairs has been reduced to being a toady for Americas bullying of the planet and bombing various Islamic countries because Israel.  Listening to him talk you would think we were watching the Israeli election for the Knesset, why the hell should our soldiers get their limbs blown off fighting in Syria to further Israel's strategic interests or whatever?  Last I checked Israel can look after itself just fine.  I find it frankly bizarre that even America has normalized relations with Iran but our insane government thinks we should still rattle our sabres at them.  No apologies or promises to dial back any of the creeping police state.



Aggregate Score: F

Jesus Christ throw these bums out already



Mulcair:  I am not a Mulcair fan, he is inconsistent and frankly I have no idea what he actually stands for and if he would stand so firmly for issues I care about if they weren't popular.  Due to the process of elimination however, barring a huge surge of Green support over 30%, he is essentially the only viable choice and it's looking more and more like I will hold my nose and vote orange.



Economy Section:  F

Mulcair offered no concrete plans that would actually help the economy, nothing on free trade, nothing on short term stimulus, nothing on interest rates.  He offered vague talk about small business but that doesn't count for shit.



Environment Section: D

Mulcair offered some vaguely worded BS about how he is against pipelines but is sort of for them as well, so basically his position is the same as the Liberal position and that kind of sucks.  I will give him a passing grade because he at least outlined what he would actually do in terms of an approval process so he passes the bare minimum requirement for giving a shit about the environment, but just barely.



Democracy Section: A

Mulcair shone in the democracy debate.  He offered clear plans on everything from Quebec sovereignty (50%+1, the only sensible approach in a democracy) a clear plan on the Senate (abolish it), and a plan for Proportional Representation to fix First Past the Post.  While he was attacked for all these positions, since there was no follow up with an actual plan to counter the NDP plan with any alternatives, these criticisms amount to bullshit.



Foreign Affairs Section: C

Mulcair basically outlined the Jean Chrétien ""just the tip"" warmongering doctrine where we will help the USA be a douchebag, but only just enough to satisfy our NATO obligations.  I can live with that I guess, but my god, what happened to the NDP on this issue, Mulcair even complained that we weren't being douchebags to Russia *enough*.  Full repeal of C-51 thank god.  Overall meh, but I can live with meh.



Aggregate Score: C-

You can do better than this NDP, lucky for you your competition is even worse.



Justin Trudeau:  Like many people I was taken in by the Justin phenomenon as he offered so much promise.  Earlier this year when he was talking about ending Marijuana prohibition and hitting Harper on his record of undermining our charter rights and international reputation, I thought to myself oh my god, I think I want to vote Liberal for the first time in my life.  Sadly, it was all downhill from there.



Economy Section: F

Like everyone else, Trudeau was a complete failure here as well, offering absolutely nothing, nothing on free trade, nothing on short term stimulus, nothing on interest rates.  He sounded good but give me some tangible thing to vote for.



Environment Section: F

Trudeau was good at attacking the other leaders for their environmental inconsistencies, but literally offered less information as to what he would actually do about pipelines or natural gas than Harper.  Yes, I noticed you dodged every question, so, fail.



Democracy Section: F

Trudeau's position on the Senate and electoral reform was essentially the same as Harper's, though it sounded almost like it wasn't and had lots of great attacks on everyone else's plans, but again, offered me absolutely nothing about what he, Justin Trudeau, would do.  Like Harper he BSed about his senate non-solution which was also shown to be BS within minutes of stating it, and completely dodged Mulcair's question about what a legit threshold for sovereignty should be in Quebec (though apparently people thought his non-answer was great for some reason?  wtf people...)



Foreign Affairs Section:  F

A cloud of bullshit sounded great but what the hell are you talking about, no Trudeau your whole party voted for C-51, you don't get to talk about personal liberties and charter rights.  Liberty vs Security debate is not one where you can create a police state AND live in a free society, those are polar opposite positions which you are claiming not only can but should coexist.  Worryingly Trudeau completely stayed out of the debate on wars abroad or bombing various brown people, so I guess he agrees with Harper or doesn't care.



Aggregate Score: F

Running a completely fat-free zero carb campaign of rainbows and puppies and loving Canada in your bones <_<



Elizabeth May:  Watching this debate made me wish she was the NDP or Liberal leader, who the hell put these jokers in charge of their parties?  In many of the debate sections, she was literally the only person to talk any sense at all.

Economy Section: D

May was the only person to actually propose something that might actually work to improve the economy, at least in the short term, by proposing an army of tradespeople to insulate buildings and houses across Canada.  Where the funding would come from, and what she would do after that project is over were absent, and there wasn't anything about trade or interest rates but my god an actual proposal that would work.  I can't believe the highest score on this section is a D, but May wins this section.



Environment Section: A

Though she just ignores the economic impact of just cockblocking any and every pipeline or LNG project and it would probably be a disaster to take that approach to the whole economy, you can't fault her environmental policy for anything.



Democracy Section: C

She made great points about our democratic system and the Fair Elections Act, the Senate, and our electoral system, but I was disappointed at her BS about how the Greens are just fine with the FPTP system and she didn't offer anything on Senate reform and basically said people should just stfu on Quebec sovereignty.  Solid C though.



Foreign Affairs Section:  B

Very strong showing on foreign affairs, advocated the shocking position of actually following international law (omg) and brought up the intellectual bankruptcy of our national anti terrorism policy.  I was very impressed with May here.  I was disappointed that she promised nothing regarding C-51 and barely mentioned it.



Aggregate Score: C+

**Principles**

1. Promoting policy founded in the scientific method. 
2. Science is not a set of beliefs. Science is a method for gaining knowledge. 
3. Policies should be based on evidence based research. 
4. Policies should not interfere with basic freedoms. 
5. Government should aim to educate the populace, only passing unpopular laws when necessary. 
6. Empower bureaucratic departments by ridding them of political interference.

    <Intro>
I’ve done a snap analysis using the Customs Act, the Privacy Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and a few comments from redditors.  

In this analysis, and adopting the thesis that average Canadian views a cell phone is more like an external part of your brain than it is ‘goods’ crossing the border, I find that the contents of Canadians’ cell phones are used as a means of self-incrimination at the border under s. 98 of the Customs Act, and that this charge distorts s. 5(2) of the Privacy Act.  This distortion sits along with several other Charter transgressions: s. 2 (a),(b),(d), s. 6, s. 7, s. 8, s. 9, s. 13

As reported by Jack Julian at the CBC, the information in a cell phone is a ‘good’ and the ""importation and exportation of which is… controlled or regulated under this act of Parliament.” 

If it is the common belief that the cell phone and the communications through that device are as personal as interpersonal correspondence and/or one’s own thoughts, then the device has less in common with ‘goods’ and much more in common with the Customs Act s. 11 definition, wherein persons may be asked questions — not have their thoughts invaded.

*""You can’t possibly remember all of the things; so they go in my phone.  The phone is an extension of my brain.”*

In the 21st century, human beings associate in a way that is broader with the use of intermediary devices, i.e. cell phones, tablets, and the like.  The trade off is that this information is recorded and can be copied and retained forever.  The associations that we have, incidental or otherwise, can be used against us precisely because of their eternity.

**The crux of the CBSA’s position:  If you give a statement at the border that is contradicted by evidence found in your phone, they’ve got you.**

*YSK that Alain Phillippon is charged is for “hinder[ing] or prevent[ing] an officer from doing anything that the officer is authorized to do."" (Customs Act, s. 153.1(b))*

    </Intro>

This is a shortened, paraphrased version of the conversation my partner and I had.  It’s a conversation that I think needs to happen in more homes in Canada and everywhere else (we are Canadians living in Guatemala).  

Me (to her, reading from CBC News): A Quebec man charged with obstructing border officials by refusing to give up his smartphone password says he will fight the charge… minimum fine for the offence is $1,000, with a maximum fine of $25,000 and the possibility of a year in jail.

Her: What are they looking for?
Me: I don’t know.  Here, ""Under the Customs Act, customs officers are allowed to inspect things that you have, that you're bringing into the country,"" [Rob Currie, director of the Law and Technology Institute at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University] told CBC News. ""The term used in the act is 'goods,' but that certainly extends to your cellphone, to your tablet, to your computer, pretty much anything you have.""

Her: They can search for t-shirts I didn’t declare or bricks of cocaine or whatever.  Those are ‘goods.’
Me (mumbling to myself): He was ""charged under section 153.1 (b) of the [Customs Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52.6/page-88.html#h-91)” 

153.1 No person shall, physically or otherwise, do or attempt to do any of the following:

(b) hinder or prevent an officer from doing anything that the officer is authorized to do under this Act.


Interestingly, it is [Part VI, Section 98](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52.6/page-64.html#h-76) that details what officers are authorized to do and the powers of the CBSA.  

Search of the person
98. (1) An officer may search

(a) any person who has arrived in Canada, within a reasonable time after his arrival in Canada,

(b) any person who is about to leave Canada, at any time prior to his departure, or

if the officer suspects on **reasonable grounds** that the person has secreted on or about his person anything in respect of which this Act *has been or might be contravened*, **anything that would afford evidence with respect to a contravention of this Act or any goods the importation or exportation of which is prohibited, controlled or regulated under this or any other Act of Parliament.**

To the bias of the CBSA as reported by Jack Julian at the CBC, means that the information in a cell phone is a ‘good’ and the ""importation and exportation of which is… controlled or regulated under this act of Parliament."" 

    <Sidebar> 

However, the layperson’s understanding and practice of cell phone ownership has much more in common the contents of your brain and your faculties of communication than anything else.  The device is a personal external memory. If it is the common belief that the cell phone and the communications through that device are as personal as interpersonal correspondence and/or one’s own thoughts, then the device has less in common with ‘goods’ and much more in common with the [Customs Act s. 11 definition](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52.6/page-7.html#h-16), wherein persons may be asked questions — not have their thoughts invaded. 

You can ask me questions.  You can ask me questions about my phone, but don’t presume to ask my phone questions about me.  My phone is me and you have me right here. 

Sources on Reddit have the following to say in December 2014

u/BSOThrowaway: You have to provide your password to us when you cross the border. If you refuse your phone may be seized and held indefinitely until it's unlocked. While I understand and respect rights to privacy, at the same time, phones are typically only searched for a good reason. We don't have the time nor resources to just search phones for the fun of it.

u/ryanthekiwi: I have some friends in CBSA. They have told me that the majority of their busts are indicated or confirmed by cell phone searches. People are surprisingly careless with email and message history.

**And this is the crux of the CBSA’s position.  If you give a statement at the border that is contradicted by evidence found in your phone, they’ve got you.**

</Sidebar>

Back to the original question: What are they looking for?

Me: They’re looking for connections.  Anyone you’ve talked to, anyone you’ve met, anyone whose phone number, or What’sApp, or email information you’ve got.  They’ll copy your entire device your 8GB or 32GB drive and archive the information until they decide that it’s useful.  
Her: Wait… right.  It’s information is what they’re looking for.  That’s the world now.  I've always thought I would say, ‘I’ve got nothing to hide.’  But, I think more now about what opening myself to indiscriminate searches by authorities represents in our world.  I think more of the examples from our past.  I’ve learned more about all the complicated things that people do that are not illegal but that people want to keep to themselves.  And I don’t want to live in that world.  
Me: You can’t meet anyone anymore.  You and I have been to Jordan. What if we saved the phone number of someone we met there; and then, coming back to Canada they find that the number is on a watch list.  
Her: So, what, we have to vet everyone we meet?  Everyone has to be vetted?

The concept of vetting absolutely everyone you meet is something of a lucrative nightmare.  I thought at this point that some good comedy could be written here by others more comedic than myself.
 
Me: I want to say ‘colloquial’, but I’ll say this: in the everyday person’s view, a cell phone is “external memory.” You can’t possibly remember all of the things; so they go in my phone.  The phone is an extension of my brain. 
Her: I don’t usually get worked up about the things like this that we talk about but this one is very… personal.  You can search my bags or whatever, but my phone is like a look inside my head.  So, what, now Canada has the right to download my brain?
Me: Just stick a few electrodes on and copy your memories.  Or, they could look at your phone. 
Her: My phone is a very personal space.  So, what about this guy?  What doesn’t he want made public?  
Me: A person doesn’t need to be worried about their information being made public.  A person only needs to worry about the prying eyes of one other person.  That’s enough for an invasion of privacy.  It’s funny, all of the examples that I can come up with are sexual… but again, that’s because it’s so personal.  

This then seems to fall under the [Privacy Act, s. 4](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-2.html#h-5), which states: 

Collection of personal information
4. No personal information shall be collected by a government institution unless it relates directly to an operating program or activity of the institution.

The institution, CBSA, is directly operating the program of border security and 21st century counterterrorism, so, there’s your direct relationship.  Counterterrorism includes the collection of information that relates to the (in)security of the nation, which can include any and all information in your mobile device.  However when it comes to s. 5 (2) of the Privacy Act: 

Individual to be informed of purpose
(2) A government institution shall inform any individual from whom the institution collects personal information about the individual of the purpose for which the information is being collected.

The response received by the CBC from CBSA states, “To divulge our approach may render our techniques ineffective. Officers are trained to look for indicators of deception and use a risk management approach in determining which goods may warrant a closer look”; 
thereby rejecting the provisions of the Privacy Act on the grounds of “National Security”.

Furthermore, there is the small issue [Charter of Rights and Freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html).

Fundamental freedoms

2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

(a) freedom of **conscience** and religion;

A person forced to cover their tracks on their cell phone when crossing international borders must first think of their actions as a potential threat in order to safeguard against molestation by authorities.  This position leads to much cognitive dissonance.   


(b) freedom of **thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication**;

If no where else in the physical world, a cell phone often contains one’s innermost thoughts and correspondences.  Certainly, there is much that my partner has said in a moment of anger or frustration that she would rather not have repeated.


(d) freedom of **association**.

In the 21st century human beings associate in a way that is broader with the use of intermediary devices, i.e. cell phones, tablets, and the like.  The trade off is that this information is recorded and can be copied and retained forever.  The associations that we have, incidental or otherwise, can be used against us precisely because of their eternity.


Mobility Rights

Mobility of citizens

6. (1) Every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada.

The right to travel is what has made my life, thus far, possible.  I have been an expat for almost eight years.  The thought that returning to the country is an automatic warrant for Canada to search, seize, and store my personal information is enough to intimidate other Canadians away from ever leaving the country.  


Legal Rights

Life, liberty and security of person

7. Everyone has the right to **life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.**

Search or seizure

8. Everyone has the right to be **secure against unreasonable search or seizure**.

Detention or imprisonment

9. Everyone has the right not to be **arbitrarily** detained or imprisoned.

Self-crimination

13. A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any other proceedings, **except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence**.

And this is where I return to u/ryanthekiwi: I have some friends in CBSA. They have told me that the majority of their busts are indicated or confirmed by cell phone searches. People are surprisingly careless with email and message history.

The consequences of this single scenario are the basis for the discussion that Canadians need.  The privacy of today will not be the privacy of the future.  A push for well-reasoned, public, informed, and open discussion of our private information is essential to our continued reliance on these platforms for communication.  Three possible futures that I can see from here: 

1. Canadians allow our officials to pass bills that place national security interests ahead of all others.  Communications are monitored on any passing whim and privacy reaches its end. 

2. Canadians take part in shaping the digital future of Canada by being informed and taking steps to protect any and all incursions, sought or unsought by Government or others by adopting standards, practices, and technologies that limit the exposure of individuals to violation.

3. Canadians abandon the digital age as we know it; opting for other means of communication.

2. Winter/Summer speed limits. 140 max on highways, (govern the engines with tamper-proof seals at 145) with long straight stretches for summer, 90 for winter. Too often do I see r-tards in the ditches in winter, thinking they can do 120 on icy highways.

3. Allow drinking and driving with 3 clauses: The first being that if you hit someone, the victims family chooses how you are punished. If you kill them of they die because of your actions, there is no trial and you are put to death. If you damage property, the total value of said damage is exacted upon your household, personal property, etc.
Clause 2: Since you are being tracked anyway, the government and emergency services gets to know where you are at any point of the day/night. Clause 3: You get hurt, you are last in line in emergency. If you live, it's because you are lucky. It may sound cruel, but it will weed out people that just don't deserve to live.

4: Same goes for texting/distracted driving. Your insurance is invalid anyway, and there is no trial. Guilty as charged.


5. Give homeless people a chance to re-enter society by giving them jobs, healthcare and housing. If they cannot meet and maintain minimum set living standards because they are lazy and prefer to be out on the street, then they can be shipped off to a tropical Island where they can be homeless there.

6. Impose a stringent law that states that a maximum 20% of profits from any company may be invested in the markets/hedge funds, etc. Banks and Insurance companies are to be 18%. Standard targets for EBITDA are 18%, so this will not damage them in any way. 

7. CEO Bonuses are to be no more than three times that of the lowest paid employee in the company.

8. Legalise and Tax weed, and make it wholesale for all. If people want it, they will find it. Why not use the money made to improve infrastructure? Prohibition, anyone?

9. Any government official is to have a packed lunch, and cannot expense any meal unless it is a reasonable expense for working late such as takeout, (DQ, Wendy's etc). 

10. Government officials are not to have Facebook, twitter or any social media of any kind. They have a job to do.

11. No pensions/wages for prisoners. Room and board, (and possibly all the sex you want) is enough.

12. Change divorce law so that it takes one month. This is more than enough time to value assets and complete the necessary paperwork.

13. Any immigrant that wishes to work in Canada must be tested on English/French up to a grade 8 level. You fail, you are out.

14. Remove all ""faith"" sections from media. If Satanists and Muslims cannot preach in open press without back lash, then nobody can as it is not fair.

15. Make government jobs ""open to all"", pending a series of tests- moral, physical, mental, etc. But do the test in public for all to see, (you may even be able to charge money for spectators). A minimum score will be required to get on the voting docket. Anyone who has watched The Krypton Factor will understand the trials I'm suggesting.

16. Canadian citizens get the right to vote to see if troops are to be deployed overseas, and how many-- unless actual war is declared, (not the war on drugs or terror, because they are stupid).

17. No phones/tablets of any kind are allowed in government meetings. EVER.

18. Government staff are to carpool when possible and stop stealing parking spots in their often extravagant cars.

19. Prisoners can learn a trade. But it is assigned to them and is to be constructive, (seamstress, carpenter, etc). Demolition Man-esque I know, but it will work.

20. Remove money from politics. No lobbyists, no ""fluff"", big meals and hidden agendas. If you pass the test mentioned above, you are worthy to run.

21. Let Canada vote on whether TV should contain a minimum percentage on Canadian content.  My vote is no. Canadian TV is garbage. ""Let's watch Republic of Doyle"". Said no-one ever.

And the final crazy idea:

22. Remove the stock market. Completely. Trade has existed for hundreds of years. It can exist without it. The SE are based on lies and speculation. A company is to merited on it's products/service, not on potential worth.

I have a TV antenna and cable internet with a smaller provider. It is affordable and I can get a lot of my Canadian content over the air and on the wire through CBC, Netflix, and Radio-Canada. CBC and Radio-Can have great live streaming services. All three have excellent catalogs of shows and content online. There is one large missing piece here: Hockey.

This is the first season that Hockey Night in Canada is now being shown on what is essentially premium cable channels. I have looked into getting the cheap premium cable package from VMedia but that alone will cost me $40/month. Switching to Rogers or Bell will cost me far more to have both cable and internet. I subscribed last year to NHL Gamecenter but it would only show out of market games that were not nationally televised. It too is quite expensive at nearly 180$ this year. I dropped my subscription.

I believe it is time for the content to be separated from the medium it is served. It is completely a conflict of interest that Rogers and Bell own so much of the content as well as the distribution network. I cannot get the content without paying into the expensive and antiquated broadcast cable model. Why must I subscribe to a cable TV bundle and then add the premium sports packages in order to view Hockey? If the CRTC was serious about protecting Canadian culture and content, then why should it be prohibitively expensive to watch Hockey Night in Canada? Shall I rather spend my saturday evening playing american video games and watching american movies online?

My ideal: subscribe to individual channels online. IPTV is the future after all. I am perhaps an early cord cutter but our numbers are growing.

The worker with whom I spoke answered each of my questions with, ""I can't say what will happen because it's dependent upon your circumstances."" So naturally I asked if each case was reviewed individually, to which he replied, ""no, there are rules to follow"" but he wouldn't give me any insight.  

So to keep it short, I was laid off last week. I am also 18 weeks pregnant.  
Here's my dilemma: if I file a claim now, I need to work 600 hours or 15 weeks full time in order to be able to file a new claim when the baby arrives.  It's very very likely this baby will arrive ~4 weeks early, possibly more, so in order to get these 600 hours in I'd need to start working right now.   

Now this is where I'm confused: if I file a claim now, find a job of similar pay next week (ha!) and therefore don't receive EI benefits but *don't* meet the 600 hour minimum, when will my maternity/parental leave benefits expire? Will I get roughly a full year, or will they expire a year from when this claim was made? Or will I be ineligible for any maternity leave benefits at all? 

How late after being laid off is too late to file a claim? Would it be in my best interest to postpone filing one until I'm certain I cannot find a decent job?   

Obviously, my goal here is to find a job and work until the baby arrives. But I'd like to avoid having to resume working, or having benefits run out before the baby turns 1, because daycare here for infants is prohibitively expensive - so ideally I'd like to be able to take that full year off.

Governments try to combat drug addiction with policies which address both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as policies which can mitigate the harms of drug abuse. Demand reduction measures include prohibition, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses, treatment (such as voluntary rehabilitation or coercive care for drug abusers), awareness campaigns, community social services, and support for families. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking. Policies which may help mitigate the effects of drug abuse include needle exchange and drug substitution programs, as well as free facilities for testing a drug’s purity.

With the passing of Bill C-10, also known as the Safe Streets and Communities Act, Canada has taken a conservative approach to drug use through prohibition and criminalization. Do you believe this model has been successful? How should Canada proceed with regard to drug policy?

""Thank you for writing about Bill C-23, the Conservative Government’s Unfair Elections Act.  Your concerns put you in good company!
 
The NDP is vigorously opposing this bill and has been taking numerous actions to oppose the Conservatives’ attempt to ram it through the House of Commons without adequate debate and study.
 
Passing major changes to the Elections Act should be done in a non-partisan way, consulting with experts and all parties. Instead, the Conservatives failed to consult the top expert on elections law – the Chief Electoral Officer – and then moved to shut down debate an hour after the Minister introduced the bill.
 
Canada’s top elections expert, the Chief Electoral Officer, testified before the Parliamentary committee yesterday and raised several concerns that remain unanswered. Marc Mayrand said that there’s no other democracy in the world whose government has restricted public education on electoral fraud among other things. The NDP has been requesting a thorough study of the bill at the committee stage, including cross-country hearings to hear from affected Canadians and stakeholders across the country. Conservatives are fundamentally changing our election laws and refusing to hear from Canadians.
 
This is why, on the heels of Dave Christopherson’s successful filibuster, New Democrats have announced we will be moving forward with pan-Canadian consultations on the Conservatives’ Unfair Elections Act. While the groundswell of opposition to this unfair bill continues to grow, New Democrats will continue to lead the fight to make sure Canadians are heard.
 
We have launched a national campaign to rally against Bill C-23. Join us by signing and sharing the NDP petition here: http://petition.ndp.ca/stand-up-for-canadian-democracy 
 
This proposed legislation will actually make it harder for many Canadians to vote, it muzzles Elections Canada and it gives the Conservative party an unfair advantage. This bill is nothing short of a serious attack on our democracy.
 
Look no further than C-23's removal of the right of the Chief Electoral Officer to engage in democracy promotion and general public education. Bill C-23 muzzles Elections Canada by prohibiting the institution from speaking publically about democracy or the importance of voting and from engaging with Canadians through initiatives like the Student Vote Program in schools. During the 2011 election, over 500,000 students across Canada cast mock ballots through the program, an effort designed to encourage them to vote when they turn 18. At a time of record low voter turnout, this change just does not make any sense. You can find a list of their education outreach programs that will be affected on Elections Canada’s website here.
 
Bill C-23 will also make it harder for some Canadians to vote. Under Bill C-23, Voter ID cards, issued by Elections Canada, will no longer be accepted. This will make it much harder for students, seniors, aboriginal people, and low-income Canadians to prove their right to vote, and will prevent many thousands of Canadians from voting. That’s on top of the 120,000 Canadians who had a neighbour vouch for them and who will be turned away next election.
 
Conservatives claim that vouching and VICs are the source of widespread fraud, but there is no evidence to support this. Instead, this appears to be a concerted attempt to disenfranchise those with lower incomes or more transient lives with U.S.-style voter suppression tactics.
 
The bill even bars Elections Canada from conducting electronic-voting pilot projects that might be attractive to younger voters—unless it gets permission from not only the House of Commons but also, wait for it, the unelected Senate – an additional barrier that was not necessary prior to this bill.
 
The Conservatives also claim that they are taking “big money” out of politics when in fact it creates new ways for ""money politics"" to skew elections, by raising donation and campaign spending limits as well as creating a huge loophole that allows virtually unlimited campaign spending for purposes of contacting previous donors. Stephen Harper’s election reforms will increase the influence of wealthier individuals on politics by raising individual donations to $1500 and allowing candidates to give $5000 to their own campaign.
 
Clearly, the Conservatives are using this bill as a way to try to stack the deck in their favour for the 2015 election, and beyond.
 
Further, Bill C-23 fails to grant Elections Canada's requests for key investigative powers it needs to crack down on electoral fraud such as the ""robocall"" fraud during the 2011 election. Bill C-23 was supposed to offer the tools to crack down on this abuse. But Conservatives refused to enact the single most effective measure to enhance investigations—namely, giving Elections Canada the power to compel testimony. And they ignored a 2012 NDP motion that would have given Elections Canada the power to request political party documents – in order to verify compliance with election expenses rules – which would help uncover shady schemes. The bill does add stronger penalties for impersonating an elections officer but they do not go far enough, as requested by Elections Canada.  Suddenly the Conservatives are soft on crime – when the issue is fraud and they are the suspects.
 
Opposition to this unfair bill is growing – and the NDP is at the forefront making sure that the voices of Canadians are heard. The NDP leader Tom Mulcair, my colleagues and I have been asking the tough questions in Question Period and in the media.
 
We will keep up the fight for their voices to be heard on a bill so fundamental to their democratic voting rights.
 
Thanks again for writing.""

They've provided a service that's worked for me for about five years now. I know they're not popular on this subreddit, but I thought their shitty business practices were exaggerated.

I got my monthly bill in my email inbox last night, and noticed it was about $3.50 more than it has been in the last several years. After looking over my bill, it looks like they've changed me from a ""Bundle 7"" which was $7 a month, to a ""Bundle 10"" which is $10 a month. I was not informed of this change in any way. I started investigating.

Apparently it was a mistake to go in to the Bell store. They have some very nice employees, but apparently the Bell store is completely useless when it comes to bills or plans, and you have to call in or chat online. This doesn't really make much sense to me, but after lamenting the wasted gas and time, I went home and got online.

Unfortunately the chat rep wasn't of much more help. Below is a copypasta of the chat transcript. I'll try to format it to make it more legible.

* info: You are chatting with Ramil. 
* *Your name*: Nick (last name redacted)
* *Your number*: (phone number redacted)
* *Your question*: It looks like Bell has changed my plan to a more expensive one without telling me, or without my consent at all. It seems that I now have a Bundle 10 where I used to have a Bundle 7. Again, I did not ask for this, nor was I informed of this change until I got my bill. 

* **Ramil**: Hello and welcome to Bell Mobility's chat service.
* **Ramil**: Hi there, Nick!
* **Ramil**: How are you today?
* **Nick**: I'm alright. A little annoyed because of the issue, but otherwise fine. How are you?
* **Ramil**: I'll be happy to assist you regarding your feature here.
* **Ramil**: Can I also have the email address associated with your account?
* **Nick**: My bills are sent to (redacted)@Hotmail.com
* **Nick**: And actually that's another thing. Unrelated, but can I change that email address?
* **Ramil**: We can definitely make the change here for you email on the account.
* **Nick**: Actually I may have found on the website where to make that change.
* **Ramil**: Thanks for validating your account here for me, Nick!
* **Ramil**: Okay.
* **Nick**: Okay, looks like that's changed now.
* **Nick**: Do you need the new email address to verify or something?
* **Ramil**: For the feature bundle 7 and now it is already bundle 10, it is still the same bundle, it is just that it had a price increase effective last March 1st and from $7/month it became $10.
* **Ramil**: May I have the new email please?
* **Nick**: (redacted)@Gmail.com
* **Ramil**: Thanks!
* **Nick**: But I mean I signed a contract last year for that price with that bundle. Is Bell allowed to change that whenever they want, without informing me?

*Note: I had typed my email address using several capital letters*

* **Ramil**: Is it really big letter's for the N and M and G? 
* **Nick**: I don't really think it matters, regarding the capital letters
* **Nick**: It's just how I type it
* **Ramil**: Okay.
* **Ramil**: I have made the update on the email on the account here for you.
* **Nick**: Thanks, but to reiterate my question, I signed a contract last year for a specific plan with a specific bundle with a specific price. Is Bell allowed to just change that whenever they want without telling me?
* **Ramil**: The feature are subject to price increase without prior notice however, you will still be notified about this changes using the contact information's that we have for you account.
* **Nick**: Well I wasn't. I just noticed that my bill was more expensive this month. My bills are emailed to me.
* **Nick**: I was not notified of this price increase at all.
* **Nick**: I received my bill in my inbox last night.
* **Ramil**: I see.
* **Nick**: If you can raise your rates whenever you want, why did I even sign a contract?
* **Nick**: I thought the contract was supposed to lock that price until the end of the contract?
* **Ramil**: It will lock the price for the rate plan that you have but not for the features included on it.
* **Nick**: That seems pretty underhanded and shady to me.
* **Ramil**: I apologize but it is how it is for the agreement with bell.
* **Nick**: So there's no way to lower my rates back to what they were when I signed the contract? To me, Bell raising my rates (again, completely without any sort of warning) is a breach of contract.
* **Ramil**: I have another option for you. Since I'm unable to negotiate any special arrangement with you through eChat, you can discuss possible promotions or credits beyond those normally offered by Bell Mobility by calling our Client Care specialist for assistance.
* **Ramil**: The telephone number for our Client Care department is 1 800 667-0123 or *611 free from your handset. The office hours are Monday to Friday, 8am to 9pm; Saturday and Sunday, 9am to 6pm.
* **Nick**: I'm reading my contract, and it explicitly states ""We will notify you by providing you a clear and legible written notice at least 30 days in advance of any change that affects you.""
* **Ramil**: No worries though because I will properly document your account here regarding your request for the next representative to be able to make sure that your issue will be taken cared of right away.
* **Nick**: Okay, I'll try calling in later, I guess.
* **Nick**: Thanks, Ramil.
* **Ramil**: You're most welcome!
* **Ramil**: Would that be all for now?
* **Ramil**: I'm sure they can give you a better deal since you have been a loyal Bell customer.
* **Ramil**: 
* **Nick**: That will be all for now. Thanks.
* **Ramil**: Thank you for chatting with me regarding your bill. Have a wonderful day and take care!
* **Nick**: You too.


Hopefully that turned out okay because it took forever to format properly. Anyway, The point of this post is to ask you guys for advice before I call in tomorrow. I've worked the phones in a call centre before, so I'm not good at getting upset at people on the phone, so I'm worried that nothing will happen. Are they allowed to do this? Just rates my rates whenever they want? I'm reading my contract, and it states:

> **19. Changes to this Agreement and the Service.** You agree that any Sections or parts of this Agreement, any fees or other obligations, and any Services, may be modified or terminated by Bell except to the extent expressly prohibited by any law that applies to Bell. We will notify you by providing you a clear and legible written notice at least 30 days in advance of any change that affects you. If applicable and if required by any law that applies to Bell, the notice will set out the new provision or the changed provision, and the provision as it read formerly, along with the date of the coming into force of the change and your rights set out below. Nothing in this Agreement requires you to accept the Services after any change is made to this Agreement, the fees or Services; however, your sole remedy for such a change is, if the change would increase your obligations or reduce ours, to refuse the change and cancel the agreement which has been changed upon the payment of any amounts payable as specified in the main part of your Service Agreement and any other applicable fees or charges, except where such fees or charges are prohibited by any law that applies to Bell, in which case such cancellation shall be without penalty. You must notify us of your cancellation within 30 days of the effective date of change. If you continue to receive the Services after this period, you expressly agree that no additional written agreement or express acknowledgement is required to accept such change and, unless otherwise prohibited by any law that applies to Bell, you specifically waive any and all statutory requirements for notice and express acceptance of such changes except for those provided in this paragraph. You agree that you cannot change this Agreement and that, except as expressly prohibited by any law that applies to Bell, no oral or written statement or representation of any sales agent, representative or employee of Bell made to you can change this Agreement.


(Above copy/pasted from [here](http://www.bell.ca/Bell-Mobility-Corporate-Terms-of-service). It seems to be the same as what's on the physical contract I have in front of me)

If I'm reading that correctly, I'm allowed to cancel my contract for free if they change anything. Is this true? I'm guessing they would make me pay what I still owe on the phone, which is probably several hundred dollars. More importantly, it explicitly states that they have to give me 30 days notice, which, again, they did not.

Again, what are my options here? When I call in tomorrow (or the next day, or whenever I call in), what do I say? Keep in mind I'm no good at being rude or upset on the phone.

Thank you SO SO much for reading this wall of text, and any help or advice you can provide.

What does /r/Canada think of this email response that my friend got after calling the MP's Ottawa office? 

-----

1)      Young adults were targeted because:

There was an Elections Canada report investigating youth participation rates in the 2011 General Election that stated youth non-voters expressed that not knowing where (25%), when (26%) or how (19%) to vote played a role in their decision not to vote. That is why Elections Canada’s Report on the 41st General Election, listed its first priority on youth be “increasing awareness about when, where and how to vote, by providing information in formats suitable to them” (From Elections Canada).  The Fair Elections Act fulfills this desired goal.

2)      In terms of donations, I have the following information:

The Fair Elections Act will ban the use of loans to evade donation rules. However, the Fair Elections Act will allow parties to better fund democratic outreach with small increases in spending limits, while imposing tougher audits and penalties to enforce those limits. The Fair Elections Act’s modest adjustments in the donation limit (to $1,500) and election spending limits (up 5%) will let parties raise their own funds to reach out to Canadians. The total ban on union and corporate money remains.

Essentially, our Government believes that political parties should do their own fundraising, not live off of taxpayer-funded handouts.  The increase is marginal, but it will help parties to step-up their fundraising efforts and to partially offset the elimination of taxpayer subsidies.  Finally, the Incremental increases to the contribution limit will provide predictability and stability for Canadians who wish to contribute to political parties

3)      Finally, investigating has been improved as the Act:

Allows the Commissioner to seek tougher penalties for existing offences. It also empowers the Commissioner with more than a dozen new offences to combat big money, rogue calls and fraudulent voting. Finally, the Commissioner will have full independence, with control of his or her staff and investigations, and a fixed-term of seven years, so he or she cannot be fired without cause.
 
Also, the Act Cracks down on voter fraud by prohibiting the use of vouching and Voter Information Cards as replacements for acceptable ID. Studies commissioned by Elections Canada demonstrate mass irregularities in the use of vouching and high rates of inaccuracy on Voter Information Cards. Voters will still have 39 forms of authorized ID to choose from to prove identity and residence.",canada,A parliamentary assistant for a Winnipeg Conservative MP replied with these points in response to a friend's concerns about the Fair Elections Act.

I've found some... things.

Forcing corporations to give up information, *installing tracking devices on vehicles* (see bottom), it's quite the nasty piece of work.  Let's dive into it, shall we?

It allows the government to issue ""production orders"".  These require corporations to give information on someone and give them protection from repercussions.  Specifically, it is said:

>Clause 7 adds provisions to Criminal Code that will allow investigators to obtain “production orders” **to compel persons not under investigation (third parties)** to produce, at a specified time and place and in a specified form, data or documents (or to prepare and produce a document based on data or documents) relevant to the commission of an alleged offence under any federal law

These are divided into two types: general and specific.

I really don't see the distinction between the two.  They both suck.  Let me walk you through it:

The general production order is to request documents or data from a third party, and has three criteria: an offence under federal law has been or is suspected to have been committed, the evidence is relevant; the person to whom to order applies has 'possession or control' of the information.  

Okay.  Well, I don't like that is thats 'or is suspected to have', but let's give the benefit of the doubt.  On to the specific orders.

These specific orders are for banks and corporations.  They relate to more specific things like *your name*, account number, account status, open/close date etc.  They have a similar three criteria: an offence under federal law has been or will be committed; the information will assist in the investigation; the institution receiving the order has control/possession of the information. 

It says in the paragraph explaining these qualities that 'the threshold for obtaining a specific order is lower than the comparable threshold applicable to a general order'.  Neat. 

It also distinguishes between the two by stating 
>to obtain a general order, the issuer must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been or is suspected to have been committed and that the documents or data will afford evidence relating to the commission of the offence.  By contrast, to obtain a specific order, the issuer must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been or will be committed and that the information requested will assist in the investigation of the offence.

Literally the only difference between the two is:
>reasonable grounds to ~~believe~~ suspect that an offence has been or ~~is suspected to have been~~ will be committed.

now, if that doesn't sound like doublespeak, I don't know what does? That first sentence barely makes any sense.  Does it mean 'reasonable grounds to believe that an offence is suspected to have been committed'? First of all, what? Secondly, if so, how is that different from suspecting an offence has been or will be committed?  [ctrl+f 'supreme court' [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/editorials/electronic-interception-should-not-be-without-a-warrant/article15551915/) to see Globe and Mail reference the Supreme Court decision that outlines the Conservatives' dodgy lingustics]

Oh, phew, well at least the 'persons' who get these things can apply to not have to follow the request, right?  Except that you 'cannot refuse to comply with the order on the ground that they may be incriminated by any information they are required to produce', so isn't that cute?  Right after that is where it states that if whatever is requested incriminates the provider then it may not be used against the person who provided it.

[Here's a Globe and Mail article discussing the Bill](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/columnists/maybe-one-day-revenge-porn-will-be-have-no-power/article15804000/)

There is also a broader analysis of the Bill [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1zplrw/effort_post_what_the_hell_is_up_with_bill_c13/) where I found:

Clauses 14-17 are all about computer crime, nothing about cyberbullying (the Bill's intended and explicit 'purpose' despite the fact that there are completely unrelated things)

Production orders can be produced about tracking data. also:

*New Code section 492.1 provides for warrants to authorize the installation of “tracking devices” on vehicles and things carried or worn by individuals and “transmission data recorders” to obtain transmission data. Again, both these warrants only require “reasonable grounds to suspect”.*

and literally right under that it mentions where you get immunity for providing information that you 'aren't otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing'.

The actual text in the bill with respect to vehicle tracking says **to track a thing (vehicle) you must suspect, but to track something carried or worn by someone you need to believe**.  I'm not lying.

With no more than a few keystrokes the RCMP has effectively banned two previous legal rifles – the Swiss Arms carbine/rifle and the Czech CZ858 – without compensation.

The Swiss Arms rifle is a semi-automatic version of the current Swiss military rifle used by target shooters and hunters across Canada.  There are number of Swiss Clubs/Associations across Canada who, as a part of Swiss culture and citizenship obligation shoot this rifle on a regular basis.

These are precision rifles with an average value of $3,000 – there are approximately 2,000 of these rifles in Canada.  To put that in perspective $6 million in private property is about to be seized.

The Czech CZ858 is a look-alike of the Russian AK47 but entirely mechanically different – none of the internal parts are the same.  This rifle has been imported into Canada since 2005 and is regularly used for hunting and sports shooting for the last 7 years.  

Approximately 9,000 of these rifles have been legally imported each with a retail value of $700.

Both of these rifles were imported with the full approval of the RCMP after a thorough inspection by the RCMP Firearms Laboratory to ensure that they comply with the Canadian Firearms Act.

Earlier this week these rifle were completely legal – the purchasers of these rifles all have Firearms Possession and Acquisition Licenses, went through a 3 to 6 month waiting period and paid up to $80 for an RCMP criminal record and background check.

This all changed over the last two days.  The RCMP has decided that these rifles are now illegal and have now changed the classification of 11,000 of these rifles to Prohibited.

*In the Criminal Code of Canada (Section 91), every person commits an offence who possesses a firearm without being the holder of (b) in the case of a prohibited firearm or a restricted firearm, a registration certificate for it is guilty of the crime of ""Unauthorized Possession of a Firearm"".*

*Every person who commits an offense under Section 91 is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or of an offense punishable on summary conviction.*

**Are you more in danger now that these firearms are prohibited when no more than 48 hours ago these rifles were completely legal?**

**Will you be safer when the RCMP come and seize these rifles from people who have licenses, legally have gone through all the background checks, jumped through all the hoops and have legally purchased and used these firearms for the last 10 years?**

I don't think so

Even though many of you may not be interested in firearms, we are asking the Canadian public to join with firearms owners and tell the Harper Government and the RCMP that creating 10,000 new criminals in Canada doesn't make Canada any safer.

Many of them echoed [our press release of January 17](http://pencanada.ca/news/stephen-harper-online-sureillance-canada), which was timed to coincide with Barack Obama's speech to Americans about NSA surveillance of ordinary American citizens.  Shouldn't Canada's prime minister have been saying something to Canadians, too?  Plenty of people happen to think so.  Ms. Cavoukian is one of them.  I'm glad to hear she agrees.  But why didn't she mention, as we did, that it's not the Canadian government we have to worry about?

Ms. Cavoukian feels that Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) should ask for a warrant before it eavesdrops on anyone in Canada.  Of course it should.  But it won't matter in the slightest whether it does or not.  In fact, it won't even matter whether the CSEC surveillance takes place or not.  The Americans will have already done it for them, and will have gladly shared the information with the Canadian government... because this is what we do for them, all the time.

I've been pounding this drum loudly and longly for a while now, and yet for some reason I feel no one sees the significance:  as outlined in [a blog post by Professor Avner Levin](http://pencanada.ca/blog/on-backdoor-information-access/) on the PEN Canada website in July of 2013, Canada and the US have an information-sharing agreement that allows us to spy on each other's citizens and then share the data.  This means both governments can easily circumvent those pesky rules that prohibit them from spying on their own citizens.  No one cares about spying on foreigners, after all.  In fact, everyone probably believes that's a good thing.  As John Stewart said, paraphrasing U.S Secretary of State John Kerry, ""Nations be spyin', yo!""  

Sure they be.  That's what nations do. But who is supposed to protect a nation's citizens from being spied on?  Its government.  Who else?  Unfortunately, just the opposite is happening.  The very entity that is supposed to be defending us from espionage is actually encouraging it.  It's treating our privacy, and our freedom, and our dignity, as nothing but a not-particularly-valuable token in an endless game of international intelligence-swapping.  This, in my opinion, is just as much a crime as the surveillance itself.

The Canadian media should be ashamed of itself for having failed to screech as loudly as humanly possibly about Levin's explanation of how things really work.  Every Canadian should know about this, and they shouldn't have to dig to find the information, either.  The current government ought to be ashamed of its complete lack of a response to PEN Canada and every other entity who has asked for a public explanation of the revelations by Edward Snowden.  And Ann Cavoukian, though her heart is in the right place, should be asking much tougher questions of the government.  

As should we all.

Initially on a land crossing, then at postal customs. I left recently to return to school and discovered reddit and thought I could do my part to inform the public.

You may have noticed I have been fairly vauge, this is because I want to avoid being identified since the CBSA takes security very seriously and I don't like taking chances. I sent a message to the moderators with my verification, Lucky75 will attest to that.

For this AM(a)A, I'm more than happy to answer your questions about postal customs, being a BSO, and what the CBSA does I've seen BUT I won't be giving away protected information and I won't be identifying myself.

I want to try to focus more on experience here and I will talk about the laws we enforce and what those laws say on Thursday over in /r/CanadaPolitics.

**Finally, before we get this started, a few notices:

1. Everything I say here is** my own personal opinion and does not in any way reflect the position (unofficial or official) of the CBSA or the federal government**.

2. I'm no longer an officer and have no law-enforcement authority in any way. Anything I say is, again, my personal opinion and not professional advice you should take or use.

3. Je suis plus qu'heureux d'accepter des questions en français dans l'esprit du pays bilingue, mais je dois avouer, c'est pas ma premier langue alors je voudrais vous demander de m'excuser pour mes erreurs.**

Edit: Since not so many questions are coming in, I thought I'd just write here a little about what postal customs is.

Essentially, when you send something from abroad into Canada by mail (or any other means of conveyance), it has to clear customs to enter the country. Postal is its own type of port-of-entry (POE). There are three facilities in Canada that deal with mail: Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. Toronto is the biggest (I believe). At postal we see everything from lettermail to whole bicycles and car parts in parcels. Of course, we also see things like prohibited weapons, controlled substances, and animal/plant products. Most of the time, our job is simple. Parcels are either cleared for entry or referred to be rated (charged taxes/duties). Those that are rated have an E14 postal invoice attached and are released to Canada Post. Sometimes we have to be a bit more thorough. Depending on which postal customs facility, the process is a bit different. One of them x-rays a lot, one targets and opens all suspect parcels. At the end of the day, the effect is the same. Everything that should be inspected is inspected. It's only a small minority that are held for enforcement action. Of that minority, very very few are what we think of as illegal drugs (like marijuana or cocaine). More often, it's just someone's family sending an unsafe meat product or prescription drugs that go to the CFIA or Health Canada's inspectors. Steroids, weapons legal in the US but not Canada, and improperly declared tobacco are among the most common customs enforcement actions, and a bit less frequently, a plant called Catha Edulis (Khat) and alcohol (which is unsafe to ship by post).

Edit: I'm going to take a pause because I've spent too much time infront of the screen and not enough time helping with dinner, I'll try my best to get to every question so you can keep them coming.

Edit: I will come back again tomorrow afternoon and get the remaining questions. Thank you very much to everyone who asked, I promise I will get to every question.

**Final Edit: Thank you everyone for your questions, this was very fun and I hope I answered them to your liking. I will be over at /r/CanadaPolitics tomorrow at 2pm for more policy side questions and answers.**",canada,"IAmA former BSO for the Canada Border Services Agency, AMaA!",0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1ml38m/iama_former_bso_for_the_canada_border_services/

My question relates to electronic cigarettes, and I'm curious to know what the internal, *unofficial* stance of Health Canada is on the topic.  

The official stance, released back in 2009, is here:    
http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2009/13373a-eng.php  

The gist of it is that the products have not undergone sufficient testing, so until then they are not authorized for sale.  Companies selling the product containing nicotine have been sent warning letters to stop doing so.  Popular opinion has been that since Health Canada has no legal basis to take action (accidentally, they are technically not legally prohibited under an exclusion clause that was written to allow Nicorette vaporizers to be sold) all they could do was send out threatening letters.  However, it has now come to light that they have actually initiated actions (seizing assets, threat of legal prosecution) against at least one vendor who had been selling product containing nicotine.  The difference with this vendor was, they had actually initiated the testing process to obtain market approval (granted, while still selling product with nicotine, which probably wasn't too bright.)

If Health Canada (and similar organizations throughout the world) was genuinely only concerned about the health of Canadians, they wouldn't still be sitting on their hands here in 2013 while thousands of Canadians (and millions worldwide) are switching to electronic cigarettes and finally getting off traditional cigarettes.  Like others, I tried everything (patch, gum, drugs) multiple times with no success.  Electronic cigarettes worked *effortlessly* the first time, and you can read anecdotal story after story just like mine.  

One major issue at stake here is the government revenue from tobacco taxes.  Total annual federal and provincial revenues for tobacco taxes are somewhere in the range of $7 **B**illion dollars per year.  (http://www.smoke-free.ca/factsheets/pdf/totaltax.pdf).  That works out to about $200 per Canadian, smokers and non-smokers - if all smokers were to switch overnight, the government would have an extremely serious revenue problem on their hands.    

It's a huge amount of money, and it makes one wonder if *just maybe*, Health Canada's ""wait and see attitude"" towards what is arguably the most revolutionary development in history in the cause to get people off cigarettes is a result of them taking their marching orders from a higher power.  If you are a legitimate intellectually honest organization, you can't simultaneously assert that you truly want Canadians to quit smoking, but then proceed to essentially ignore a technology like this year after year as its popularity explodes due to its effectiveness.  

So, long story short....I'm hoping there might be someone here with friends or family that works for Health Canada that might know what the real, ""unofficial"" story is on the matter. (And if anyone reading this knows something but doesn't want to post publicly, feel free to PM me.)

EDIT:  
I should add....to anyone reading this, if you or your friends or family still smoke and you haven't given ecigs a shot yet, please do.  Head over to http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette where you'll find an extremely enthusiastic and helpful community, tons of guides on getting started, trustworthy vendor recommendations, etc.  Even ignoring the ""unconfirmed"" (due to lack of extensive laboratory testing and FDA approval) health benefits, I am personally saving *well* over $3500 per year.",canada,Anyone know anyone who works for Health Canada?

While I'm familiar with many of the talking points of the Conservative Party, I'm sure there is a lot of nuance left out. I feel the issues below are an important part of any functioning government, where do you stand? 

Sciences: government support of sciences is important, both through government funded agencies, including Parks Canada, MNR, Health Canada, and also through funding for research grants and support for universities and colleges. Getting rid of the Long Form Census was, in my opinion, a bad decision, leaving us with a much smaller picture of the Canadian demographic, and less able to make informed policy decisions in response. In anticipation of response on this, I feel the free market is not effective at providing incentive for certain types scientific studies, especially studies that face great industry resistance and funding (climate change being a great example). 

Environment: Full Disclaimer, I'm an environmental studies grad. The environment is a critical asset that needs proper management by government, and this includes setting and meeting GHG emissions goals. This includes regulating industry to manage environmental impacts, strong penalties that discourage pollution, and long term policy that encourages the transition towards a sustainable future. In terms of types of policies that seem successful, Germany has successfully started this process with strong economic incentives for people to invest in solar. Sustainable energy seems like a non-partisan issue to me (so long as it isn't coupled with regulation), is that the case? As an additional note, it seems like free market forces are poor at reacting to long term issues, especially where the alternative requires significant short term investment.

Industry Regulation: This is such a broad topic, but there is absolutely a time and place for industry regulation. A great example would be the banking sector. Without the banking regulations in place at the time, our economy would have suffered a great deal more. When the consequences of seeking exorbitant profits are a net harm to the economy, those net harms need to be part of a regulatory framework. 

Taxes: We need to pay for the things that society needs/wants, and we do this with taxes. It's a simple matter, really, but the amount of taxation will need to reflect the amount of services that the government provides, whether that's a lot of services or very few. A tax system will also manage income inequality, which needs to be avoided/mitigated.

Drug Prohibition: I would imagine the decriminalization of pot would be an easy non-partisan issue. Reduction in spending on police forces on one hand, with increased personal liberty on the other. Are there reasonable cases for the continued enforcement of pot? As far as other types of drugs go, I feel we need to manage not only the criminal element involved, but also the human aspect. First, what happens when you put pressure on an inelastic product? price sky-rockets and drug dealers make more money and have even more incentive for violence and gang activity. In order to both reduce crime and the human impact, following the Portuguese example makes sense, along with government taxation of pot in order to pay for it. With the revenue generated by the sale of pot, we could focus on providing social and addiction services to reduce poverty and help them to become drug free. In this aspect, I don't think that personal responsibility advocates have a good argument, sometimes we just need a helping hand. 

Sorry about the wall of text, these are just some of my opinions on these issues. Where do you, as conservatives, stand? Have I framed the issues correctly or ignored certain aspects? Thanks for your input.

**EDIT: Thanks to all those who spent time contributing something, and even more if you were polite and thoughtful. It's been interesting to say the least**
