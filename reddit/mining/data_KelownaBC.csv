&#x200B;

We are from Calgary and planning to visit Kelowna for 3 days next weekend. We are fully vaccinated (will carry proof), will be wearing masks and respect provincial guidelines for travel.

I believe the wildfire situation has gotten better with the recent rains. We are planning to visiting a vineyard, spend some time on the lake and bike myra canyon park. Are there any other places of interest (within 2 hrs drive from Kelowna) which we can see in the fall? Any places to see the Salmon run or any good easy/moderate hikes ( < 8k ). Appreciate any suggestions.

You don't have to be blind to see on the streets, in the malls, on the roads and other places frequented that there are many immigrants moving to our beloved country Canada.

Many are moving because of supposed capital gains as opposed to wanting to enrich our nature, culture, economy and education. When I reach out and talk to some (if they can speak English) it becomes apparent that I can't use slang, jargon, cultural references or share personal beliefs; because to them any opposing idea is considered racist. It's unfortunate that they've learned this word, especially those coming from Asia who have class-ism so embedded within them. In wake of these new citizens new trends have developed, some I notice are the rise of: vegetarianism, pacifism, pride, segregation, curfew as well as disassociation with conversation and debate. These contradict values I believe are important to Canada, such as our fishing industry, cattle and livestock (which is renewable and sustainable, these animals wouldn't exist if this industry wasn't there), respecting our military, wanting to push boundaries, and provide intervention when necessary. Our multiculturalism is possible because of American media, as well as women and men respecting one another, working together and from trusting one another in marriage and in growing strong families. Also fighting for the privilege to sing, be famous, throw parties that upset the neighbors without repercussion, and finally being able to argue our beliefs so everyone's opinion can be heard, criticized and kept. 

These are huge problems in my opinion that need to be addressed. I can't imagine moving to a new country and then trying to dictate the social norm; I suppose it's because I live by the moto when in Rome.
