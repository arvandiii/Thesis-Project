They have suggested we donate the tickets or sell on marketplace. For many that were directly impacted by the fires, or have given elsewhere this does not make sense financially. For selling on marketplace , this has not been successful for most as DOTD as reopened ticket sales as a direct competitor.

They have also “updated” their policy on their site to state that refunds will not be provided should the event be postponed. This was not there before the wildfires.

I know this post likely won't reach the intended person but still, I feel the need to vent my frustration with yet another example of people's unhinged stupidity and ignorance these days.

Tying your dogs immediately in front of the door is bad because:

1. Blocking a fire exit
2. Someone could get attacked if the dogs get spooked or accidentally stepped on, or they aren't friendly dogs
3. Irresponsible ownership of animals. Either don't bring them, have a trusted person watch them while your in the store, or if you absolutely MUST bring them, tie them up out of the way where they'll be more relaxed and not likely to cause an incident.
4. There's likely other issues with this whole scenario that aren't coming across my mind at this exact moment.

As I stepped outside this morning and breathed in the fresh air, it felt like a curtain was lifted, and hope was back.  I’m hoping that all of us can get outside today and enjoy.    

I would like to thank everyone who shared information in our live chat, helped one another, and generally banded together to get through the fire as best as possible.  

We will of course have lots of time to take stock of what was lost, but also to consider how we must meet the threat of climate change head on, or eventually be destroyed by it.  I’m urging everyone to think about this next time you vote.  Next time you contact your politicians on another issue.   It’s real, it’s only going to get worse, and it will be our children who bare the brunt of it in the coming decades.    

Also, we’d love it if you’d share your favorite story/experience from the past week.

Kelowna, B.C. – Assessments to identify properties with significant structural damage from the wildfires in the McDougall Creek Wildfire are now complete. Damage assessments conducted by the Canada Task Force 1 Team, is the first step in aiding the public notification process. The release of this information to affected residents is a priority today for the communities of West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation and the Regional District of the Central Okanagan Electoral Area West, in learning the status of their properties. 

To date, three of the four property owners in the City of Kelowna and three properties in the District of Lake Country have been contacted to confirm significant structural damage on their properties. Residents currently on order are strongly encouraged to register with Emergency Support Services at [https://ess.gov.bc.ca*open\_in\_new*](https://ess.gov.bc.ca/) to support contacting property owners affected. Patience is requested during this process as assessments are conducted within a large area with ongoing wildfire hazards and will require time to ensure accuracy.  

As Evacuation Orders are downgraded, residents returning home can access frequently asked questions and other [resources](https://www.cordemergency.ca/resources) to aid in a safe return. The public is reminded, for the safety of the public and fire crews, please do not enter areas under an evacuation order. There are still many areas where active firefighting is underway and dangers like downed power lines, hazardous materials, damaged trees, debris and equipment pose a safety risk.  

Residents are asked to stay up to date with the status of evacuation alerts and orders through the CORD emergency site and also subscribe to receive e-updates. Go online to [cordemergency.ca](https://www.cordemergency.ca/). View the up-to-date evacuation order and alert areas on [cordemergency.ca/map](http://www.cordemergency.ca/map).  

For more information, contact the information line at 250-469-8490 (local) or 1-877-569-8490(toll-free).

[Source](https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/442949/The-province-has-lifted-the-travel-ban-to-interior-communities-except-West-Kelowna)

Just announced by MinisterMa  - effective Midnight tonight.

It still could be imposed or extended again, depending on conditions.

The ban opened up thousands of rooms they needed, so it appears they aren’t as short on rooms now. Recommended you should still not travel to these regions, mentioned in the initial [**Travel Ban Order**](https://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/provincial-state-of-emergency-august-18-2023/) \- This now includes the amendment made today:

In a [Statement issued Tuesday, August 22nd,](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023EMCR0057-001332) Bowinn Ma, Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, announced the Emergency Order restricting non-essential use of temporary accommodations **will be lifted** for Kelowna, Kamloops, Oliver, Osoyoos, Penticton and Vernon effective Wednesday, August 23rd.

Restrictions will remain in place for West Kelowna, where non-essential travel **for the purpose of staying in temporary accommodation, including hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, hostels, RV parks, and campgrounds, remains prohibited.**

This restriction will support access to accommodations for evacuees and personnel providing emergency and critical services. The public is asked to avoid non-essential travel to areas impacted by wildfires. Roadways must remain clear for emergency response operations.

**ATTENTION!!** The full order from the BC Government is linked above for you to read in full.This —-> [**Travel Ban Order**](https://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/provincial-state-of-emergency-august-18-2023/) \- Please note this is still only about Accommodations and there is no order preventing you from travel along these routes. You are only being asked to avoid travel to the fire regions if you can do so. West Kelowna remains as a city where you are prohibited from booking accommodation.

I was walking down Enterprise earlier today and there was this dude screaming *White Rabbits! I Hate White Rabbits!* at the top of his lungs. He wasn’t a crazy street person. He wasn’t on drugs. He said he was the freaking mayor. 

I asked the mayor, “What’s wrong?” I shook his hand and said, “You’re doing a good job. This smoke isn’t your fault. None of this is your fault…”

“White Rabbits…white rabbits. They used to be on Enterprise, but now they are on Harvey and only I can see them!”

Maybe that guy wasn’t really the mayor. Perhaps he was crazy. Or perhaps you made him crazy, Smoke.

Do you want to know why people say *I Hate White Rabbits* when you get all up in our faces? Well, it’s an interesting story that dates itself to the Boy Scouts. Apparently a camp councillor told the kids that smoke was made of billions of tiny white rabbits, fluttering about in random trajectories by the wind and the heat of the flames. The story gained enough traction to become an urban legend.

But the real question we have to ask is, what the hell were you doing hanging around with a bunch of underage children, Smoke? And why were you prancing around their bodies doings little seductive dances? If you don’t quit that behaviour Ronan Farrow gonna write a *Vanity Fair* article about you. 

Okay, I will concede you do make a hotdog taste better. But why must you insist on smoking all the humans? What are you planning, Smoke? Why are you trying to seal in all our succulent juices?

I think it is time to leave town, Smoke. While you might be the inspiration for Wayne Wang’s second best movie, your time has come to pass. The problem is you are lazy. You just sit there, doing nothing like a nihilistic teen asking adults if they can by them cigarettes outside the 7-11. You have no skills outside of flavouring meats and signalling nomadic hunter gatherers when they can’t find their IPhones. 

And yet, some day soon a hard rain will fall, or perhaps a mild breeze will dance down this valley and carry you away. And as you drift away from our memories until next fire season, remember: you are not made of little rabbits. You are a suspension of airborne particles and gasses mixed with air. Technically you are an unwanted byproduct of fire. That’s right, Smoke, even Fire doesn’t want your lazy ass hanging around.

If you have a window AC unit, floor (portable, with tubes) AC unit, or even an old box fan, all you need is a furnace filter. I used one of these: [https://www.homedepot.ca/product/filtrete-filters-filtrete-healthy-living-maximum-allergen-filter-mpr-1900-16-in-x-25-in-x-1-in-3-per-pack/1000668614](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/filtrete-filters-filtrete-healthy-living-maximum-allergen-filter-mpr-1900-16-in-x-25-in-x-1-in-3-per-pack/1000668614)

This is similar to the Corsi-Rosenthal Box concept created during the COVID 19 pandemic, however it only uses one filter instead of 4 and uses equipment that many people already have. I don't know many people who have box fans, but I know countless people with portable/window AC units. The boxes are undoubtedly better, but this still works and is much cheaper and easier to make.

Simply pick a filter that fits your AC's interior air intake closely in one dimension, and then cut it to size in the other dimension. In this case a 16 inch wide filter fit my unit perfectly, I just had to cut it in half to fit the vertical dimension. Then, making sure you align the airflow direction arrow correctly (these are directional filters) tape it to the unit with whatever you have. I used some aluminium tape because I wanted to do a fairly neat job, but you can use duct tape, electrical tape, or anything else that will hold it on. The suction will pull the filter against the unit, you just want to seal off as many gaps as possible so that most of the air goes through the filter. You can usually get two uses out of a single filter, so it's cost effective, with the filters usually costing $20-$30 each. I usually have to replace them during smoke season once per month, your mileage may vary depending on your AC. Mine is a 12,000 BTU Toshiba unit from 2019, and does an excellent job of moving lots of air, and in my experience has beat out a $250 Danby purifier with one of these filters.

You can also do this with an industrial box fan that can be purchased for cheap at most hardware stores and are normally not in super high demand as they are large and can be loud, so find one that is bearable for you and accept the tradeoff of a bit more noise for cleaner air. You can always run it during the day when you are away from home and turn it off when you get back, it'll still filter a lot of air in that time.

Keep in mind if your AC has an especially weak fan, this may not work super well, and may trip the machine's circuit protection, causing it to pulse the fan. I've had this happen with another machine, and the solution was to leave a gap at the edges, after which it worked fine and still managed to turn the filter entirely dark brown after the fire season in 2021 so it did obviously still did something.

&#x200B;

During the White Rock Lake fire we came across this FireSmart BC thing which details what you can do around the around of your house to better protect it from the wildfires nearby. It goes over the different types of mulch, fuel sources, plants and landscaping features which can make it easier for fires to start and spread around your home. 

&#x200B;

We found it helpful as a guide while we were on evac alert to try and help protect our house as much as possible in the event the fire got close to our house. Moving mulch away from the house itself, pruning trees and cutting down the landscaping grasses can slow the fire or stop it from burning up against your house, as well as remove a flammable source where embers can land.

What can I do? I have told them countless times that BC is in a state of emergency. My case should fall under their natural disaster policy however they are trying to tell me because Edmonton isn’t in a state of emergency there’s nothing they can do.

Edit: thank you all for your help! My issue has luckily been solved thanks to a super nice person at Airbnb Support. If you are in a similar situation, as in you were supposed to leave out of the province and Airbnb is refusing to allow you under their policy to get a refund, then definitely call them, explain you couldn’t leave because of a natural disaster, and when they eventually say there’s nothing they can do ask to talk to their boss or someone that can actually do something. If you treat them with respect in a calm manner they are very likely to help you as they did me. An hour after talking with this person and asking for someone that can do something they got back to me with a full refund.

Hi my name is josh I'm posting this on behalf of my disabled mom. Any help would be greatly appreciated!


------------------------------------------------------------------------

I currently have a hotel room. But I haven't been able to speak to the emergency services. With regards to getting help with the cost. I have my card to get in line to get the ticket that I need to get to the hotel but I have to go over to the westside to line up to obtain this ticket.  The hotel wants to wants to me to leave the hotel room.  

  Right now, the University is on full  evacuation and because my apartment building (800 academy way) is tied to the University Mission Group told us to evacuate last night i was  put on  a evacuation alert.


  The rest of my neighbors have evacuated. Im not sure how close the fire is im worried im going to have to return only for the fire to change and i wont be able to get out.   My son was able to help me get out but he is also physically disabled, has autism, and lives in assisted living so he is unable to help

I have a small senior dog and i cannot walk without assistance and i am in a huge amount of pain. Im worried about losing my place to stay.

Am I qualify as officially evacuated because I can't afford another night at the hotel?  Should I keep the room? I don't know what to do.  Anybody got any information like they could tell me before I leave the hotel? 

Thanks you so much for your time. I know this is a stressful time for everyone and my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected or has lost their homes.

I know some of the more expensive real-estate streets near where I live in the Mission already have buried lines, and maybe it's already policy for newer developments.

You may think you’re so hot, but really…it’s the CO2. You ain’t got nothing compared to those younger, stars. They’re bigger, alright. But they’re bigger in all the right places. It’s that low metalicity. Super, sexy, low metalicity.

Sure you’re not as old as the Red Dwarfs in the neighborhood, but you go to the same parties. Astronomers say you both may have life, which means you have the same lifestyle. You shop at the same boutiques, while the younger, hotter suns shop at Forever 21.

And some day you’re going to get fat…so fat that your circumference will extend all the way to Mars. Perhaps Jupiter. Say what you want about the Red Dwarfs, but they manage to keep it tight. 

Oh, and by the way, sun…all those little forest fires just make people hate you more. It’s super annoying and some of us have asthma.  And the boiling of the salmon in the rivers is borderline sociopathic. Like you would even eat salmon. You’re the kind of sun that eats nothing but pizza. We see all those little spots on your surface. You don’t get that kind of complexion eating boiled salmon.

And enough with the Northern Lights, honey. It comes off a little desperate and a tad dramatic. You’re not Michelangelo. You’re a big ball of gas. We haven’t even named you. We just call you *sun*. You’re name isn’t even capitalized when written in the middle of a sentence.

The City is seeking the public’s help to identify the culprits who poisoned a mature tree at 1055 Sunset Drive. This incident is the third of its kind within the last 12 months, excluding a separate incident involving a burnt tree on Earth Day.



“It’s hard to understand how someone in our community would go out of their way to kill a tree like this, to drill 25 holes in it and fill them with herbicide,” says Infrastructure General Manager Mac Logan. “The City will have to recover the cost to eventually remove the tree replace it, but the idea that someone would actively choose to harm their community in this way bothers me greatly. It’s now happened for a third time in less than a year and we as a community need to stop such acts.”



Tragically, the poisoned tree will perish over the next two to three months and City staff will seek to preserve the tree in an effort to continue to support local wildlife until it is deemed a safety hazard and needs to be removed.



Previous acts of intentional vandalism targeted urban trees on Manhattan Drive and in the Clarence Greenspace area. The vandalism at Clarence Greenspace last summer led to the harm of more than just the initial target. Due to a connected root system, six other Aspen trees died as a result.



In addition to the targeted poisonings, on Earth Day this year, the Kelowna Fire Department responded to a fire burning in the root system of a mature tree in Kelowna’s waterfront park on Cedar Avenue, and while extinguished, the tree was significantly damaged and had to be removed.



Investigations to identify individuals responsible for this latest case of vandalism are underway and we strongly encourage residents to come forward with any information they might have. 



Anyone who may have witnessed, or has information relating to, this incident is asked to phone the Kelowna RCMP at 250-762-3300 referencing file number 2023-800746.



If you wish to remain anonymous, you may also contact Central Okanagan Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or leave a tip online at crimestoppers.net.",kelowna,Why????,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/13lgiss/why/

Are there walk in clinics? Might be a stupid question but there arent any where I am now despite the fact that I live in a major city. Its emergency room or nothing. And people have started dying before they can be seen.

My second biggest concern is does home insurance cover wildfires? Or is it like Florida where they won't cover any storm that has a name because they happen so often?

My last concern is how badly does fire season affect quality of life? Like is from June to September basically a wash in terms of outdoor activity? Is the air dangerous for someone with asthma/lung issues?

TLDR; I love gardening and know Kelowna is well known for its fruits and veggies and farm stands etc but what is the average home gardener experiencing in terms of growing things with frequent water bans, scorching Temps etc? This wouldn't keep me from moving there I am more just curious about this one.

Me and my fiancée have a plan to move somewhere off the island in the next little while when we can get out finances in order. In a compromise, we decided that Kelowna would be a good fit for the both of us - as she wants to live somewhere bigger and I would preferably live in a town with max 50,000 population.

I've been thinking about it more and more and coming up with pros and cons for moving there vs moving to say Nanaimo. So far what I have come up with is

**Pros:**

- Bigger with more things to do (I'm not really an outdoorsy person so hiking and trails and rivers don't really excite me where I currently live, but going out from time to time is still fun)
- Possibly better job opportunities
- Okanagan Lake is beautiful (but to my understanding, isn't glacier fed which is a bummer cause cooling down in glacier water is quite nice)
- A much more freeing access to Vancouver and other places (right now we have to book with BC Ferries which suuuuuuuuucks)
- Costco with a gas bar (I tend to do driving jobs and the poutine in Costco slaps)

**Cons:**

- **Snow.**
- When it's hot, it's *hot*
- Forest fire smoke

I mean, I am also worried about job hunting but that isn't really specific to Kelowna but that is another con for me.

So my question is: what do you like about Kelowna? What don't you like? What's super attractive to an outsider who has only left the Island three times in his life that screams 'Kelowna'?

For starters all waiters/waitresses do not receive any tips, all of it goes to our boss no questions asked. Secondly we do not receive paystubs nor overtime, for 2 weeks I worked 9-10 hr shifts 7 days a week straight. Yet for some reason my 18$ an hr seemed rather low when my paycheck came in and I received only 1400. In fact for the past months my paycheck wasn't even handed to me instead handed to my girlfriend who was also the previous manager until recently, I will touch on that later. I do trust my girlfriend so I do not doubt her at all but when I ask my boss to give me my paycheck in my own hand and he refuses that seems off to me. Anyways on top of all of that the restaurant has many health hazards such as cross contamination a mice infestation (I was told to literally plug it with some steel wool and a chopstick), our drinking water comes out a tap with silverfish living in it and we tend to resell a canceled order the next day after microwaving it to save money as our boss says. Last December I was having so personal struggles and started to take shots from the bar without permission and got caught, that was completely my fault, but instead of firing or reporting me, he instead regularly bought me a 40 of vodka and encouraged me to drink. I was 17 at the time and now I really struggle with my consumption of vodka, at the time I thought it was great but now I realize how much it has affected me. Anyways I personally believe there is some tax fraud/ evasion going on as he always voids bills over 100$ before printing them off and counting them, as well as one of my employees is working with no sin number but is still somehow getting taxed on their paycheck. On August 15th my boss tried to make my manager resign from her position dropping her pay from ""19$"" to an undetermined amount since he found out she was going to quit. His defense was ""you don't even deserve to get paid seeing as you don't work enough"". Anyone who has eaten there has clearly seen how much she works because she's there almost 24/7 and runs around doing everything while the others are on their phones. I told her to not sign it because it was way to sketchy and instead wrote her up one myself with clear and fair terms (if you would like to read it pls message me). Anyways it's now the next day and for 3 days now she has been treated like shit by her boss and she finally goes to drop of her resignation and for him to sign it, we brought both copies for his and her security. She goes in as I wait outside with my mother as backup and tells us he will not sign it, my mother walks in and starts slamming this man down, his response is to raise his voice and tell us to leave, so we do but the manager is still inside as he walks out and tells us to go sit on the bench, we refuse of course stating that his property ends at the door. He then threatens to call the police but when we take him up on his offer he realizes how much trouble he'd be in so he goes back inside and tells her that he needs his accountant to look over it. Keep in mind this is a 2 weeks notice paper just stating that if he does want her to work for the next 2 weeks she requires a paystub showing her income, not much to ask for. He says that his accountant will be there in an hour so we wait. An hour later he comes in and is annoyed to see what he was called in for. My bosses first question was ""Can they take me to court for this).... it's a 2 weeks resignation. He says no. After 15 minutes of his accountant begging him to sign it, he reluctantly agrees. His accountant than tells him that he needs to start being smarter as he is now in a position where everything that he's been up to can be proving, currently I know if 3 previous workers who want to sue him for similar situations. He said that she can come pick up her finale paycheck on the 18th but I have very little faith he's being honest. Is there any sort of legal action we can all take. What would be the best course of action?
Thank you for those of you who've made it this far I'm sorry it's so long I just had to vent off a little bit, he's been threatening to go to everystore in kelowna and tell them not to hire me so that also makes me a bit nervous. Anyways some feed back would be appreciated and I'd like if you could spread the word of all this underhanded stuff going on.",kelowna,"Mon Thong, the crooked Thai restaurant of kelowna",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/wqj8jq/mon_thong_the_crooked_thai_restaurant_of_kelowna/

Yesterday, someone let a technician into my apartment at around 8:30 AM to inspect the smoke detectors. I don’t know if it was my landlord, or a serviceman with a master key that let the tech in. I was not aware this was going to be happening, and I was obviously very shocked when a large man walked into my bedroom while I was asleep. (For reference, I’m a 29 year old female and I was alone in my bedroom, so this was extra scary!) I was half asleep and let him do his thing. I did tell him, rather abruptly, that I had no idea he was supposed to be there. After he left, I really started to feel violated. I checked my email and I did not have anything from my landlord, providing me with notice that this was to happen, which I’m pretty sure is his legal obligation?

I checked my email again about an hour later, and I found that I had received an email at 8:53, which provided a reminder  that there would be a fire inspection “that morning”. Now, this email was sent after the technician had been in my apartment, but regardless of that, I think I need 24 hours notice. I also wondered if he sent this email only because the tech informed him that I had said I wasn’t given any notice of the visit. 

I’m just trying to make sure I’m correct on all of this? This was a breach of my rights as a tenant, right? And if so, does anyone have any advice on what I should do? The only thing I can think of is a strongly worded email. The whole situation was super unsettling.

Kelowna, B.C. – The Emergency Operations Centre has launched an online search tool for City of West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation and Central Okanagan West Electoral Area properties that have experienced partial to full structure loss resulting from the McDougall Creek Wildfire. 

Property owners who have been placed on Evacuation Order can search to see if their property has incurred losses by visiting [www.cordemergency.ca/propertyinfo](http://www.cordemergency.ca/propertyinfo). If your property has not been placed on Evacuation Order, your address will not show. The Emergency Operation Centre asks the general public to be respectful of this process – if you are not on evacuation order do not use the search tool. 

The search tool follows the work of Canada Task Force 1 Team, which completed assessments to identify properties that incurred losses in the wildfires. This was the first step in aiding in the public notification process. Further hazard assessments must now be completed at each property, to determine the number and types of structures lost on each property. That process is completed in the City of Kelowna and District of Lake Country. The process will take longer but remains a priority in the communities of West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation and the Regional District of the Central Okanagan West Electoral Area where losses have been greater.  

To date, three of the four property owners in Kelowna and three properties in Lake Country have been contacted to confirm significant structural damage on their properties. These properties are not included in the search tool. 

The EOC expresses condolences to everyone who has experienced losses from the McDougall Creek, Clifton/McKinley and Lake Country Wildfires. 

“Some of the most challenging days are ahead. People and communities will learn of monumental loss. This will be a process of grief collectively. As we move into recovery, the needs of each impacted community will be different,” said Loyal Wooldridge, Regional District of Central Okanagan Chairperson. 

“Communities have experienced great impacts and losses and will take more time to recover. I am confident that our collective resilience will guide us forward,” Wooldridge said. “Let us honour the sacrifice and efforts made by so many over the past few days by confronting these challenges with unity and compassion.

My heart goes out to everyone who is on the front lines, who has been evacuated, who is anxiously anticipating the further unfolding of events, and who is offering help to those in need. Friends and neighbours, we are in this together!

I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor who lives and works in Kelowna. During my Masters in Counselling, I did extensive research into the mental health impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. Based on my research, here are a few practical tips we can use to support ourselves and each other during this truly unsettling, truly unprecedented time:

1. **Connect with your community.** Coming together in community is one of the best things we can do in this dire situation. If you are able, find ways to help people out by donating to support agencies, offering space in your home for evacuees, or volunteering your time.
2. **Lean into relationships.** When you are able, be a support to others by reaching out, talking with them, helping them out if needed, and making yourself available. When you need support, reach out to friends, family, and loved ones. There are always people who are able to offer help and people who need assistance!
3. **Talk about your feelings.** Any emotional response you are having is normal and valid. If you are afraid, that is completely understandable; if you find yourself in emotional denial, that’s normal too; or if you are feeling positive, energetic, and eager to help - also a normal response! Everyone’s nervous system reacts differently to emergencies. Again, the best thing we can do is lean into our communities in whatever capacity we have.
4. **Know whose mental health is at risk.** Not everyone is at equal risk of developing adverse mental health during extreme weather events. Anyone who lives in close relationship with the land is at higher risk. This includes Indigenous peoples, farmers, outdoor workers, and anyone who is concerned about the environment. Minority groups, individuals with a history of trauma, and individuals with already present mental health concerns are also at heightened risk. Take a moment to think about who you know that falls into one of these categories; if you are able, reach out to them.
5. **Be aware of long-term mental health impacts.** Individuals who have past experience with traumatic events and/or extreme weather can develop longer-term mental health challenges such as Acute Stress Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. These conditions do not always develop right away; it can take up to a year or more for symptoms to emerge. Don’t be afraid though - mental health struggles are treatable! Be aware of symptoms associated with these challenges. If you notice symptoms developing in yourself or someone you know, reach out for professional support. Also be aware that experiences of extreme weather and natural disaster can become cumulative, leaving an individual at higher risk of developing adverse mental health in the future.
6. **Advocate for climate action.** Human-caused climate change is making extreme weather such as wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, and floods more frequent and more severe. If you are concerned about climate change then find ways to advocate for climate action. Here are some ideas: write to your elected officials, write letters to the editors of your local news outlets, join a climate advocacy group like one listed below, and talk with family, friends, and loved ones about your climate concerns. Research suggests that the one of best things we can do is to use our collective anger, grief, and anxiety to fuel conversations about climate action.

We had originally booked this trip for my girls birthday last August but we had to cancel due to the wildfires.  She was crushed, as we had a few things planned she really wanted to do.  

We've rented an airbnb with a private pool and have 4 full days to spend in the area (sat-tues).  Friday and Wednesday will be travel days to/from van island.  

I'd like to plan at least one activity for each day, and a winery/restaurant visit each afternoon/evening, with a bit of free time to unwind near the pool at some point each day.  Just looking for help on specifics so I can start booking things.  So far this is what I've come up with 

Saturday- town of Kelowna visit/explore/lunch, winery tasting/dinner 

Sunday- bike rental/ride (would like the chance to do a full day bike outing somewhere interesting) and winery dinner

All scheduled flights at the Kelowna International Airport have been cancelled this evening due to the White Rock Lake fire.

“The White Rock Lake fire boundary has moved east to Lake Okanagan with a no-fly zone up to 10,000 feet above sea level – this is affecting the instrument approaches into the airport,” said airport senior operations manager Phillip Elchitz.

“As with any adverse weather situations, travellers are reminded to check in with their airline for the most up-to-date flight information before coming to the airport.”

The fire remains at 32,000 hectares. Several evacuation orders have been issued for homes on the North Westside.

When we moved into our house one of the first things I did was to check the radon using one of those FirstAlert tests you buy at Home Depot.

When I sent it in for lab testing, it came back with result of 550 bq/m3 (the safe limit is 100 bq/m3).

I then went and bought couple of Airthings Wave Plus sensors (google it, its a great ecosystem of air quality sensors, they now even have one that measures wildfire pollutants such as PM2.5!) and started measuring it in real time. I was shocked to find out radon levels upstairs in kids bedrooms were equally high with the readings downstairs (makes sense since the air circulates around the house with the furnace or AC on). 

I got a professional contractor to install mitigation system (slab depressurization via forced air out), costed me about $3000 due to complexity of how the vent plumbing had to be routed and literally since the hour it was installed and turned on the levels dropped almost instantly to below 10 bq/m3 !!!

We were told almost every single home in Okanagan, especially those on the mountain have high volumes of the gas leaking inside.

Here is the chart from Airthings app showing one of my sensors before and after.

Kelowna is known as a haven for dogs and for good reason. With an abundance of off-leash dog parks, combined with a ton of trails and hikes that your dog will enjoy. With so many options, how is an owner to decide what adventure to take with your pet next? We’ve got you covered with this comprehensive list of dog friendly activities and adventures. In addition to our own personal experiences, we consulted local reviewers, [Tourism Kelowna](https://www.tourismkelowna.com/), local guides and more to determine the top activities that your dog is sure to love!

## TRAILS AND HIKES

Have you ever asked yourself, “where can I go hiking with my dog?” Well this list was created for you!

### Angel Springs

A gem amongst Kelowna hikers, your dog will love it. The hike is considered mild and takes pups through a variety of forestry and a running creek. Local groups do a good job of maintaining the trail (even in the winter) to ensure a clean path for you and your pet. 

Dog owners will appreciate the interpretive signs with facts about the local ecology and geology.

Get directions by clicking [HERE](https://goo.gl/maps/DMUsFSgzSrv)

### Bear Creek

The hike has three well-marked loops that all begin at the common trail head. The routes range from a 15-minute loop trail to the 1.4 km Mid Canyon Trail and the longest is the Canyon Rim Trail at 2.5 km ([Tourism Kelowna](https://www.tourismkelowna.com/listing/bear-creek-provincial-park/1609/)).

You and your pup will witness a great view. You get to see everything, from the highest peaks to down by the creek. Just try not to lose your footing while jumping from rock to rock. The water quickly gains speed. Oh, and bring water. You WILL get thirsty. Reviewers suggest going first left into the forest to begin for beginners, because it gets the steep incline out of the way before fatigue starts to set in.

### Crawford Falls/Canyon Falls Park

A difficult trail, you’ll want to make sure your dog is up to the challenge before undertaking this hike. For those strong hikers and their pups, result is well worth the trek! Your pup is sure to love the waterfalls. Be sure to keep an eye out for steep inclines and pack lots of water.

[Tourism Kelowna](https://www.tourismkelowna.com/listing/canyon-falls-park-crawford-falls/1587/) provides the following directions

‘the hatch’ is a tasting emporium, an emporium the likes not seen before here in The Okanagan. But on a meta-level, ‘the hatch’ is the culmination of dreams had by a group of eccentric grapeophiles who have lived and learned the way of the vine for countless years.

That answers the ‘what’, but also asked is the ‘why’. Why ‘the hatch’? Because the time is long overdue for something like this to enter your life, and more-so; to make your life that much better.

OKANAGAN FIRES
> **KELOWNA MOUNTAIN: Previously named the ""Good Creek"" wildfire by the BCWS, this fire is located on the east side of Okanagan Lake in Okanagan Mountain Park. The fire hasn't grown at all recently, and it's still estimated to be at 400 hectares. Evacuation alerts put into place at the south end of Kelowna's Lakeshore Road were lifted Friday afternoon, as wind blew the fire south, away from homes. Today, 21 firefighters are working to establish control lines on the fire.**
>   
> LAW CREEK: This lightning-caused fire is an estimated 10 hectares in size, and put 198 homes on evacuation alert Friday, but only 69 remain under alert. It's burning about six kilometres southwest of West Kelowna. The BC Wildfire Service says the fire has been challenging as it's burning in difficult-to-access terrain, but crews are working today to contain the fire's flanks and construct control lines. 
>   
> MOUNT CONKLE: This lightning-cause fire is an estimated 118 hectares in size, but crews have hand-guarded 90 per cent of the blaze and put hose around 60 per cent. The BCWS says the fire has ""responded well to suppression efforts,"" and 40 firefighters are working the fire today.  
> 
> PLACER MOUNTAIN: This fire is burning 37 kilometres south of Princeton, and is putting up a large plume of smoke visible from across the Similkameen. The BC Wildfire Service says the fire is 255 hectares in size. Eighteen firefighters are working on the blaze, along with three helicopters and eight pieces of heavy equipment.  
> 
> MOUNT ENEAS: The fire burning between Peachland and Summerland is estimated to be 1,374 hectares in size. The fire has forced dozens of evacuation orders and hundreds of alerts in the Peachland and Garnet Valley areas. The BCWS says the fire was threatening structures Friday, and structural protection units were deployed to the area, but it's unclear if an buildings have been impacted. Forty-nine provincial firefighters are on the fire Saturday morning. At least four municipal fire departments have also responded, and crews are continuing to work on increasing containment guards.

Some words, in case it's helpful:

I empathize with the need to evaluate alternate corridors to better transport people through Kelowna and surrounding regions — it’s been a topic of discussion for over 40 years — and I appreciate this effort to illustrate technically feasible options and provide a venue to solicit community feedback.

Understanding options are very limited, due to geological logistics, it makes sense this consultation explore the concept of gutting Rose Valley, Rose Valley Regional Park, Shannon Woods, Tallus Ridge, Glenrosa, and Smith Creek for a new four-lane, high-speed highway running through West Kelowna. If this option was absent from your investigation, it would offer no options, apart from upgrading the existing corridor. So putting aside the fact that this highway would run through my home, I respect the energy and process in place to explore and present potential solutions.

As you move forward into “Phase 2, Part 2” of your consultation, where you make recommendations and have ongoing community and stakeholder dialogue, residents of West Kelowna propose that you explicitly remove the following alternate corridor options from your evaluation:

* Option 1A: Trepanier Road to Smith Creek Road
* Option 1B: Highway 97/97C Junction to Smith Creek Road
* Connector: Smith Creek to Bartley Road
* Option 2A: Bartley Road to Bear Creek / Westside Road
* Option 2B: Bartley Road Extension

The impact these options would impose on West Kelowna geologically, to residents, and to the community, would be devastating and irreversible. It would irresponsible and embarrassing for them to remain in your consultation options through “Phase 2, Part 2”.

The value West Kelowna offers, is anchored in outdoor recreation, coupled with a quiet, family-oriented lifestyle. Permanently destroying the sensitive natural parkland in this region, completely eliminates the value and appeal West Kelowna has to offer residents or guests.

The city of West Kelowna sacrificing its most valuable assets: our parkland, our wildlife, our water supply, our residential neighbourhoods, our bedrock — to save commuters tens of minutes, and introduce ‘downtown appeal’, is short-sighted at best. It’s better described by other commenters as ridiculous, ludicrous, absurd, shocking, ignorant, and disgusting.

The only option is upgrading the existing corridor, but it sounds like the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was mandated to explore a bypass, by the district (?). This is the root of the problem, since a bypass is illogical, and these options are the resulting symptoms.

Moving forward through “Phase 2, Part 2”, MOTI’s recommendations should consist of:

* Upgrading the existing corridor with interchanges / trenching
* Establishing a roadmap for maintenance and upgrades to our existing lake crossing
* Evaluating more invasive changes to traffic infrastructure Main Street / Dobbin Road
* Proposing more forward-thinking options, such as light rail and improvements to public transit to move people (not vehicles) through Kelowna. It’s clear a negligible amount of congestion is imposed by commuters just passing through, and you should be presenting modern solutions looking forward to 2040.

A bypass is not an option. It’s akin to consciously choosing to inflict more devastation than the wildfires we’ve experienced, or inevitably will experience in the future.

It’s time for this 40+ year discussion to course correct.

---

Thank you /r/Kelowna!

*EDIT: to be clear, improving the existing corridor is one of the options on the table, versus creating a completely alternate route through existing residential areas and parkland.

But here's some brainstorming on why I think we see higher rents here in BC than elsewhere on average.

&#x200B;

**Policy issue #1**

Nothing too exciting but I had one of those moments today as I was paying my property tax.  I calculated the actual dollar amount increase since last year and came up with a 5.6% tax increase.  Then I realized that I had read somewhere that landlords are only allowed a 2.5% rent increase for 2019 in BC.  Looked it up, and sure enough, there's a nice tool here: [http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/rtb/WebTools/RentIncrease.html](http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/rtb/WebTools/RentIncrease.html)

&#x200B;

Pretty hypocritical of BC Housing to cap rent increases but not property tax increases, which is essentially the rent owners pay the government.  This isn't good for landlords or tenants because it forces landlords to set higher rental prices on long term rentals, anticipating large property tax hikes in the following year(s).

(This is an issue for strata fees as well.  With no cap on increases, a landlord paying a monthly strata may see their monthly costs almost double overnight: [https://www.timescolonist.com/homes/condo-smarts-is-there-a-limit-to-raising-strata-fees-1.23113958](https://www.timescolonist.com/homes/condo-smarts-is-there-a-limit-to-raising-strata-fees-1.23113958))

&#x200B;

Edit/Add: Here's a quote from Vicki Been, ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicki\_Been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicki_Been)) a professor at NYU that has studied property taxes, rent control, etc and the effects of government policy on rental rates:

*In New York City, for example, a very high percentage of rent goes for property taxes. So we can’t be saying to landlords, “Hey, keep prices down — but by the way, your property tax just went up by 10 percent. So we have to recognize that, okay, we as a taxpaying body have an obligation to understand the effect that those increases may have on rents, and we can’t just turn around and say to the landlord, “You absorb them,” right? “Don’t pass them onto the tenant.” Because that’s an unsustainable system.*

&#x200B;

**A rough example:**  Say someone wants a 1 year lease, and for it to go month to month indefinitely after that.  The landlord has no idea how long you will stay on the month to month but from experience estimates 5 years.  The landlord pays a $3,500/yr property tax bill and a $5,400/yr strata bill, which both increase 5%/yr, while rent is only allowed to increase 2.5%/yr.  By year 5 the landlord is absorbing 5 years of property tax and strata hikes equal to an ever-widening gap of around $1,110/yr ($92/mo).  Now to account for that, the landlord has to set the rent around $50/mo higher in year one.  The longer the potential rental and the higher the potential rate hike, the higher the landlord has to go with the first year rent.  It varies from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, some years it even goes down slightly, but we also had a double-digit increase on our home just two years ago.

&#x200B;

**Taking the example a step further:** You love the place, you stay 10 years and want to stay another 10. But over those 10 years your landlord's property tax is up 70%. The building needs work and strata fees are up 80%. Over the 10 years your landlord has only been able to raise rent 25% and now he is paying more in property tax and strata than you are paying in rent. The landlord now has no choice but to ask you to leave (or sell, or evict I suppose?) so he can reset the rent for the next guy.

&#x200B;

**Policy issue #2**

Landlords can only charge 1/2 of a month's rent for a deposit, which as a former tenant, I know sounds pretty great!  Unfortunately for most places that deposit won't make a dent in a carpet replacement, appliance repair, or smoke remediation.  This forces landlords to assume you'll incur damage and charge a higher monthly rent.  With a deposit, you have an incentive to not do damage and you will get it back at the end.  Instead a landlord has to assume damage will be caused, add it to the rent, then you pay for damage whether you are abusive or not!

&#x200B;

Forcing low deposits forces the people not damaging their apartments to pay for the people that do damage their apartments.

&#x200B;

**A rough example:** A landlord offers 1 year leases on 2-bedroom apartments for $1,800/mo. The landlord knows from experience 1 in 5 renters will destroy the carpet and the carpet costs $4,000 to replace. 1 in 5 renters will destroy an appliance and appliances cost $800 to replace. 1 in 5 renters will keep an unauthorized pet, or will keep too many pets and the pets will cause damage costing $2,000 to clean and repair. 1 in 4 renters will smoke in the unit and smoke remediation requires wall cleaning, repainting, duct cleaning, and carpet cleaning costing $3,000. (Blinds replacement: $2,500, Wall repair, Countertop Repair, Cabinetry, Plumbing, Window screens, etc, etc, all adds up) The landlord does the math and figures out that while most tenants are great, some leave thousands in damage, thus repairs after move-out average around $1,800 per tenant per year ($150/mo).  But the landlord was only allowed to take a $900 deposit.  So now instead of being able to charge the repairs to the deposit of the person doing the damage, he has to charge everyone an extra $150/mo.

If you're someone that does not damage your apartment, over the year you are stuck paying $1,800 more than if you had been allowed to put up a $3,000 deposit and get it returned at the end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Summary**

If you're renting - there's two big reasons you're paying $2,400/yr ($50 + $150 = $200/mo) more than necessary on your two-bedroom apartment, and it's because of BC Housing policies, not your landlords. If you are a responsible tenant making a reasonable deposit your rental should be lower by hundreds/mo.

**1. WHAT'S LEGAL**
----------------------
There are strict laws and regulations around the legalization of non-medical cannabis. Before you buy, use, or grow your own non-medical cannabis, learn more about what’s legal and what’s not.  
  
Medical cannabis is within the responsibility of Health Canada. To find out more, go to Health Canada.  
  _  
**Legal age**  
You must be 19 years or older to buy, use, possess, or grow non-medical cannabis in B.C.  
  _  
**Buying**  
To protect your health, keep young people safe and help prevent crime in your community, non-medical cannabis will be sold exclusively at government-run stores, licensed private retailers, and the B.C. government’s online store.  
  
The BC Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB) operates public retail stores and the online store. The list of public retail stores (BC Cannabis Stores), will be available on the BC Liquor Distribution Branch page. Online sales will be available only through the BC government online store. Private retail stores cannot offer online sales and delivery services for non-medical cannabis are not permitted.  
  
The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch is responsible for licensing and monitoring private retail stores. Licensed private retailers may sell cannabis and cannabis accessories. They may not sell liquor or tobacco or any items other than cannabis and cannabis accessories. The list of licensed retailers will be available on the BC Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch’s page. Licensed retailers will be required to display a valid licence where it is visible to the public.  
  
All legal non-medical cannabis has an excise stamp attached to its packaging. Federally-licensed producers and processors apply the appropriate excise tax stamp for British Columbia. If the product does not have a British Columbia stamp it is not legal for sale in B.C. Each province and territory has a different coloured cannabis excise stamp for products sold in their jurisdiction.  

*[B.C. cannabis excise stamp](https://cannabis.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/397/2018/10/bc-excise-stamp-01.png)*  
_  
**Possession**  
Adults 19+ can carry up to 30 grams of dried non-medical cannabis, or its equivalent, in a public place.  
  
In addition, adults cannot possess any more than 1,000 grams of dried non-medical cannabis, or its equivalent, in a non-public place, such as at your home. This limit is per household and is based on the expected yield from four cannabis plants.  
  _

**Public use**  
Adults 19+ can generally smoke or vape cannabis in public spaces where tobacco smoking and vaping are allowed. But remember, second-hand smoke can be harmful and irritating to people, especially children, so be mindful when smoking in public spaces.

Smoking and vaping cannabis are not allowed in the following public places:

* Playgrounds, sports fields, skate parks, swimming pools and spray pools, or any decks or seating areas associated these places  
* Public buildings, workplaces, or common areas of apartments, condos, or dormitories, and within six metres of air intakes, windows, and doorways attached to these places  
* Within six metres of bus stops, transit shelters, train stations, ferry docks and similar places
* Regional and municipal parks, except for designated campsites  
* Provincial parks, except for areas identified or designated  
* Public patios  
* Health board properties, except in designated smoking areas  
* Registered hotel guests may smoke or vape cannabis in their hotel room if the hotel allows it.  

Community care facilities, assisted living residences, and hospitals may designate specific rooms in which residents or patients can smoke or vape cannabis.  
  
Non-medical cannabis consumption (in all forms) is banned on K-12 school properties, as well as any adjacent sidewalks or boulevards. It’s also illegal for both driver and passenger(s) to consume non-medical cannabis in a car.  
  
Local and Indigenous governments can set additional restrictions on public use of non-medical cannabis under existing powers to establish bylaws.  
_

**Vehicles and boats**   
Non-medical cannabis consumption is generally not allowed in vehicles whether they are parked or moving, but there are some exceptions to this rule.    
  
It can be used in motorhomes or other motor vehicles, or campers, or trailers when being used as a private residence and parked off a public road or forest service road where camping is allowed.  
  
Cannabis can be transported in a vehicle as long as it’s in its original, unopened packaging, or is inaccessible to the driver and occupants (for example, in the trunk). In addition, a maximum of four non-medical cannabis plants can be transported in a vehicle, but they cannot be budding or flowering.  
  
Non-medical cannabis use is generally not allowed on boats. However, you are allowed to use non-medical cannabis on a boat that is moored or anchored if it has sleeping accommodations, a kitchen and a toilet.  
  
Non-medical cannabis use is allowed in a private cabin on a commercially operated boat if the operator allows it.  
_  
**Medical cannabis exemptions**  
There are exemptions for use of Health Canada authorized medical cannabis on school property and on inter-city buses, trains and boats as long as specific requirements are met. Details are available in the [Cannabis Control Regulation under Part 5 – Medical Cannabis](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0542_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?3#hit1).  
  _  
**Advertising and promotion**  
[There are strict federal rules around promotion of cannabis.](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/promotion-prohibitions.html)  
  
In addition, under provincial regulations, it is illegal for anyone without a retail license issued by the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch to advertise themselves as a licensed retailer. Also, no one can market, advertise or promote a place as a location to consume cannabis, or spend time after consuming cannabis.  
    
To find out more about the provincial rules regarding advertising and promotion see sections 36 and 37 of the [Cannabis Control Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0542_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?3%20-%20hit1) and section 9 of the [Cannabis Control and Licensing Transitional Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0541_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?1%20-%20hit1).    
  
**2. GROWING AT HOME**
----------------------

Growing cannabis plants at home is legal. Adults 19+ can grow up to four non-medical cannabis plants per household. These plants cannot be grown in a space that is visible from a public place, like parks, streets, sidewalks, sports fields, and K-12 school properties. For example, you can grow plants on your balcony, or in your yard, as long as they’re not visible from a public place.  
  
Growing cannabis at home is banned in homes that are licensed daycares.  
  
Landlords and strata councils can further restrict or prohibit growing non-medical cannabis on their properties.  
  
Local and Indigenous government can also further restrict growing non-medical cannabis at home under existing powers to establish bylaws.  
  
**3. TRAVEL**
----------------------  

There are strict rules and regulations around travelling with cannabis. Before you leave the province or country, get informed.  

**Travelling Internationally**  
It’s illegal to transport cannabis across the Canadian border. It doesn’t matter whether you’re leaving or entering Canada, or what the laws of your destination are. Bottom line: don’t cross the border with cannabis.  
  
[People who work in legal cannabis industry won’t be denied entry into U.S.](https://www.kelownanow.com/watercooler/news/news/Cannabis/People_who_work_in_legal_cannabis_industry_won_t_be_denied_entry_into_U_S/)  

The Government of Canada has important information you’ll need to know before travelling with cannabis. [Check out this video to learn more](https://youtu.be/UEIc7lxTwPA).   

**Travelling Between Provinces**
Cannabis laws are different between provinces and territories. This includes legal age, where you can smoke or vape, consume, and buy cannabis. Make sure to learn the laws before you travel. Check out the provincial and territorial websites for more details:

**4. LEGISLATION**
----------------------  
With public health and safety top of mind, the Province has passed legislation to provide legal, controlled access to non-medical cannabis in British Columbia:  

1. The [Cannabis Control and Licensing Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/18029) aims to protect children and youth, promote health and safety, keep the criminal element out of cannabis, keep B.C.’s roads safe, and support socially responsible economic development.  
1. The [Cannabis Distribution Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/18028) establishes a public wholesale distribution monopoly, and public (government-run) retail sales, both in stores and online.  
1. Recent changes to the [Motor Vehicle Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/lc/billscurrent/3rd41st:gov17-3) will give police more tools to remove drug-impaired drivers from the road and deter drug-affected driving.  

In addition, the Province has put the following new and amended regulations in place:  
  
* [Cannabis Licensing Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0528_2018)  
* [Cannabis Control Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0542_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?3#hit1)

**5. SAFE COMMUNITIES**
---------------------- 
  
There are laws and regulations to keep your community safe. With public health and safety top of mind, the Province has passed legislation to provide legal, controlled access to non-medical cannabis in British Columbia.  

_  
**Growing Cannabis at Home**  
Adults 19+ can grow up to four non-medical cannabis plants per household. These plants cannot be grown in a space that is visible from a public place. Examples of public places include parks, streets, sidewalks, sports fields, and K-12 school properties. For example, you can grow plants on your balcony, or in your yard, as long as they’re not visible from a public place.  
   
Local and Indigenous governments can further restrict growing cannabis at home. Landlords and strata councils can also restrict or ban home-growing of non-medical cannabis on their properties.  
  
Growing cannabis is banned in homes that are licensed daycares.  
  
Learn more about [safety and security measures for growing plants](http://www.ncceh.ca/documents/evidence-review/growing-home-health-and-safety-concerns-personal-cannabis-cultivation).  
_  
**Buying and Selling Non-Medical Cannabis**  

Adults 19+ in B.C. can buy non-medical cannabis from government-run and private licensed retail stores, and the B.C. government’s online store. B.C.’s Liquor Distribution Branch provides wholesale cannabis to retail stores and operates public retail stores and online sales. The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch licenses and regulates private non-medical cannabis stores. The Province is developing a mandatory training program for non-medical cannabis retail employees. Training will ensure staff have the tools to educate consumers about responsible and lower risk use.  
  _  
**Cannabis in the Workplace**  
Public safety and health are vital to B.C. employers. And the Province has strong occupational health and safety regulations. Employers must determine if employees are fit for work. If an employee is impaired by cannabis at work, the employer must ask the impaired person to stop work and leave the grounds. WorkSafeBC encourages employers to use legalization of non-medical cannabis as an opportunity to assess how they manage workplace impairment issues.  
  
Employers can review the following resources:  
WorkSafeBC’s[ Substance Use and Impairment in the Workplace webpage](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/hazards-exposures/substance-use-impairment); [Workplace Strategies: Risk of Impairment from Cannabis](https://www.ccohs.ca/products/publications/cannabis/), a resource for employers developed by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety; and the[ Construction Industry of British Columbia Substance Abuse Testing & Treatment Program Policy](https://www.clra-bc.com/services/drug-alcohol-policy/), developed by the Construction Labour Relations Association of BC and the Bargaining Council of BC Building Trades Unions.  
  _  
**Tenants, Landlords and Strata Councils**    
Landlords and strata councils can restrict or ban growing and smoking non-medical cannabis on their properties as set out below.  
  _  
**Tenants and Landlords**  
The Residential Tenancy Act and Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act have been updated to reflect the following rule changes:  
  
* If tobacco smoking is banned in your tenancy agreement (lease or contract) entered into before October 17, 2018, this means that cannabis smoking is also banned
* All tenancy agreements entered into before October 17, 2018 will automatically ban growing non-medical cannabis at home
* For any new tenancy agreement after legalization, the landlord and tenant must negotiate whether those sections are included.  
  
Resources for Renters and Landlords:

* [Residential Tenancies in B.C.](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies)
* [Landlord BC](https://www.landlordbc.ca/#0)  
* [Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre](http://tenants.bc.ca/)  
* [BC Human Rights Tribunal](http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/human-rights-duties/housing/index.htm)     

_  

**Strata councils**  
Strata corporations considering making a bylaw to restrict or ban smoking or growing cannabis should seek legal advice. Learn more about[ getting legal advice on stratas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/more-help-and-support/getting-legal-advice).  


Many strata owners find it helpful to belong to a [strata association](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/more-help-and-support/strata-associations). These associations provide member support, resources and advice for a fee. Some information is freely available on the strata associations’ websites.  

For more[ information on how to accommodate the medical use of cannabis under Human Rights legislation](http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/human-rights-duties/housing/strata.htm), contact a strata association or a strata lawyer about the proper steps to take.  
  _  
**Local and Indigenous Governments**  

Local and Indigenous governments have the power to make decisions based on the needs and priorities of their communities including creating bylaws or other laws with respect to property, public health and safety and nuisances. Rules around where you can use or grow non-medical cannabis may vary from community to community. Some communities may choose to restrict these activities. In addition, the Province will not issue a licence to sell non-medical cannabis without support from the local government or Indigenous nation.  
  
To find out the rules and regulations in your community, please check with your local government or Indigenous government.    

  
**6. SAFE KIDS**
----------------------   
  
There are strict laws in place to protect children. You must be 19 years or older to buy, consume (through smoking, vaping and all other forms of consumption), possess or grow non-medical cannabis. Early and regular cannabis use is associated with higher risks of dependency and health problems.  
_  
**Youth**  
All children deserve to be safe, healthy, and protected from harm. That’s why the Province has taken important steps to protect youth and children from using non-medical cannabis at an early age.

In British Columbia,

* You must be 19 years or older to buy, consume (through smoking, vaping and all other forms of consumption), possess, or grow non-medical cannabis. Early and regular non-medical cannabis use is associated with higher risks of dependency and health problems later in life  
* Smoking or vaping cannabis is banned in areas where children and youth frequently hang out and play, including parks, sports fields and playgrounds  
* Consumption of non-medical cannabis (in all forms) is banned on K-12 school properties and on adjacent sidewalks and boulevards, in vehicles, and on boats while being operated  
* Youth under 19 years of age are banned from entering cannabis stores  
* It is an offence to sell or supply non-medical cannabis to individuals under 19 and there are strict penalties  
  
All packaging and labelling for cannabis is regulated by the federal government. Strict limits on the look and feel are intended to make it less appealing to youth.  

Youth will learn about substance use, including cannabis, in school from Kindergarten to Grade 10 through BC’s Physical Health Education curriculum. Topics include:  

* preventing personal harm  
* reasons people use drugs  
* physical, social, and emotional aspects of substance use  
* addiction and addictive behaviours   


_  
**Parents and Mentors**  

Parents and mentors play an important role in helping young people make healthy and informed decisions about cannabis. But talking to youth about cannabis can be difficult if you don’t know the facts.  
  
What do you need to know about cannabis?  

Check out these resources to help you have open conversations with your kids about cannabis:

**7. SAFE ROADS**
---------------------- 
  
Road safety is a priority for everyone. There are strict laws and regulations to keep our roads safe.  
  _  
**Drug-Affected Driving**  
Getting behind the wheel while impaired is not only dangerous, it’s illegal. Drug-affected drivers can face serious consequences like fines, licence prohibitions and jail-time. [Learn more about the federal laws and consequences here](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/policing/police/community-safety-policing/impaired-driving.html).  

British Columbia made changes to the Motor Vehicle Act, to provide police with more tools to address and deter drug-affected driving. Upcoming changes include zero-tolerance for the presence of drugs, such as THC, for new drivers in the province’s Graduated Licensing Program, and a 90-day administrative driving prohibition for any drug-impaired driver or driver with a blood drug concentration equal to or exceeding the legal limits under the Motor Vehicle Act.  
  
Learn about drug-affected driving and the consequences here:  

* [RoadSafetyBC](http://www.gov.bc.ca/RoadSafetyBC/Alcohol-Drug-Prohibitions-Suspensions)

* [Don’t Drive High \(Government of Canada\)](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/don-t-drive-high.html)    

_  
**Policing**    
Drug-affected driving is illegal. Police in B.C. are trained to detect and deter drug-affected driving and have multiple tools to investigate impaired driving. If a police officer suspects a driver’s ability to operate a motor vehicle is affected by a drug, including cannabis, or a combination of drugs and alcohol, the officer may require a driver to submit to a Standard Field Sobriety Test (SFST).  
  
Following the SFST, if the police officer believes that a person’s ability to drive is affected by a drug, or a combination of a drug and alcohol, the officer may require a person to:  
  
* Submit to a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) evaluation and provide a bodily fluid sample or;  
* The officer may make a demand for a sample of blood.  
 
Learn more about the tools used to combat drug-impaired driving on the[ Alcohol and Drug Impaired Driving](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ts-sr/aldr-id-cfa-aldr-eng.htm) and [Drug Recognition Expert Evaluations](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ts-sr/dree-eert-eng.htm) pages of the RCMP website.

A broad description of the restaurant:

The restaurant will be somewhere in Canada, because of the upcoming legalization. Because of regulations, it has to be a BYOC (bring your own cannabis) and there cannot be any smoking inside. The smoking area will be outside in some kind of garden-like area, set up for socializing. After you order your food, (or before, if you choose) you can go upstairs to the rooftop garden. On your way, you can rent a clean smoking piece or use provided papers to smoke your cannabis while you wait for your food.

I'm pretty introverted and like to have my own space.  That's why I'm trying to find a 1bdrm suite.  I'm not concerned if it's small, I lived in a 250~ sq foot carriage house for over 3 years and enjoyed it.  Would consider a roommate/2bdrm rental with the right person/property.

My reason for moving would be to help my dad take care of my mom, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about 8 months ago and I am an only child.  My parents grew up in Cranbrook and many years later I was born there.  When she had to get chemo she found Manitoba too cold (like any other sane person would) and they started building a house on the west side across the bridge and they moved here 2 months ago.   I don't have a job lined up since this was all so sudden, but I worked with electronics for 5 years before this so I'll be taking the steps to apprentice for an electrician and make the step up.

I've been told for years how much better BC bud is, how much better stoners are over here, how everyone looks out for you and it's very easy to obtain, etc. it sounded like Shangri La to me, because I thought, despite my lack of desire to ski, I could smoke, do yoga and just rest (I don't have a lot of restful periods in my every day life). 
I've been here for 3 days and have had no luck obtaining any pot. I've had people promise me things, but nobody has come through. Last night, I bought a round of drinks for a table of people who assured me their guy is coming up later on. I have not heard from them at all. This is upsetting, because I really felt like we hit off and I keep being told there is a lot of it here on the mountain.
In Ontario, people will go out of their way to help you out with this kind of thing, because it's tougher to obtain. I personally feel a great sense of duty to help people who want it. Because us, stoners, potheads, burn outs, however you want to label it, are a special breed. We smoke for various reasons, but we feel connected simply because we love the same stuff. We are frowned upon and ostracized and sometimes people look down on us because of our habits. But we stick together.
Right? Nope. 
If you're a flaky motherfucker, who has no intentions of helping out a fellow smoker, please don't make promises. I will look elsewhere.
I've not lost hope, I still have a few days to track the elusive BC bud.
I hope you guys get treated better by ontarians on your visit.

But there is no coordinated voice speaking out for the people who are hurt by the lack of affordable housing, the failure to seriously expand transport offerings other than cars, and the inaction of this city on climate issues. 

All too often, the loudest voices are neighbourhood associations and similar single issue groups standing up to oppose any type of change. Every city has the ability to decide to allow far more homes to be built in urban core single family areas so that older dwellings filter downwards in price; to get rid of overly restrictive and archaic 1940’s zoning requirements around minimum lot sizes, lot widths, building heights, frontage, side yards, and minimum parking spaces in urban centres; and to prioritize walking, transit, and biking instead of more sprawl, more parking, more roads, and more car traffic as planned in the new OCP. 

We’re living through the alternative of watching affordable housing disappear. Too many single issue groups will oppose densification projects like the recently approved Pleasantvale 2. This behaviour, if left unopposed, will make the idea of substantive change to our urban core areas toxic to politicians, other than downtown towers that don't really affect these entrenched special interest groups. Our zoning bylaw has pages of rules to ensure that there will be no homeless cars, but doesn’t have anything to say about ensuring there are no homeless people.

Is anyone here interested in committing to an hour or so each week to work on a group that says Yes In My Backyard, or YIMBY? These groups have been quite successful in various places including California, but it requires people to dedicate time and work together to organize and advocate for more buildings, better transport options, and actual sustainability instead of lip service.

I’d like to set up a zoom meeting this week to kick this off, and propose Friday at 7pm. Let me know in a comment below if you’d like an invitation and I’ll send a link over via a reddit message.

I'm a tiling and flooring contractor with 10 years experience. I do a lot of high end residential and commercial work here in Ontario but really want to live in the Okanagan. I was just wondering what the market is like in Kelowna now for someone in my line of work. I do all sorts of stone and porcelain work, even the big 5'x10' slabs. I also do flooring like hardwood.

Is there still a lot of work there during the lockdowns? Over here us trades are still able to work without too many restrictions so I didnt take any time off since lockdowns began.

Re: my other thread earlier today (buying local vs amazon for xmas), one of the mods reached out and offered to make a thread like this ""sticky"" if I manage it.

So let's do it!

**Step 1: Please comment below with a recommended local business** (or artisan / maker, craft shows, etc) where we can shop for the holidays - preferably independent retailers, and must be locally owned.

I'll then update the list below...

**Step 2: Please support the following businesses this xmas season.** It's challenging enough for the ""little guys"" to make it in the age of Amazon, but especially during a pandemic - many of these retailers on the brink of survival at this point.

Been restricting myself to staying inside 95% of the time save for weekly grocery runs, some solo drives and walks or bike rides. I have tons of friends, I'm not a hermit. I'm super bored just like everyone.

My question lies here: my other friends and their friends or family which range from 24-30 seem to be doing stuff outside together, allegedly social distancing. One family of 5 had some of their family of 3 come stay over for the long weekend from the coast. People going on drives together, visiting houses, and even people on the coast I know going crabbing together. We all know there's no way they all are 6 feet apart especially those in the boat and car situations, not to mention the fact that I know they aren't all wiping down nor could any of them possibly know who's touched what and where etc...

Am I crazy to think that all these people are being ignorant? Or am I taking my own social distancing too far and could be doing these things?

It has less money than the rest of Kelowna, but in my view, that makes it actually more livable and creates a better quality of life. I see that, statistically, it has higher rates of property crime, but it seems to be in concentrated areas.

Here’s why I think Rutland is actually the best location in Kelowna:

1. It’s very central. You can get to the University, Down town, beaches, shopping centres, airport, and Big White all easily and efficiently. It only takes 15 minutes to get from Rutland to Upper Mission (ie. H20).

2. Houses are actually affordable and the lots are bigger.

3. It’s more drivable than the rest of Kelowna, and has multiple ways in and out of the area, easing the traffic flow.

4. It is easier to access all ones basic needs, like grocery stores, fruit & veg stands, and sport opportunities.

5. There are more options of things to do that arent prohibitively expensive. (Ex. YMCA, family activities).

6. Schools aren’t separated by postal code, meaning there is less classism (rich/poor schools) and more integration and more varied perspectives in the classes.

7. Rutland is built for the people that live there, not for tourists.

I will be moving to Kelowna and I don’t get why this area has such a bad reputation. I don’t think it’s deserved, I think Rutland is a hidden gem in the city.

Take it as you like, but it looked to me and others like a scam. Another user and I called them out, with the other user even providing evidence for fraudulent reviews being against the terms and conditions of amazon. 

This comment was immediately deleted shortly followed by myself and the other user from the discord entirely. 

I just wanted to warn anyone that uses the discord. Take it as you will.

Thanks for all the recommendations.

Visited about five or six of the recommended breweries, Liquid Zoo, Saphire, Safari Ridge paintball.

Closing thoughts:

- breweries were all great with awesome beer and atmosphere in all
- BNA was phenomenal and is thus in a separate category all by itself; the $26 Chicken Parmesan is to kill for; super busy on a Saturday night
- Liquid Zoo was as much of a shit hole as advertised. Calling it a strip club is a stretch... it's more of a hole in the wall with three hideously ugly whores (I'm being generous here) on rotation in the middle of the floor, while they share their own interpretation of ""dancing."" And of course, no where to sit (no one dumb enough to pay $700+20% tip for their VIP table). Read a lot of complaints about ""over-active"" bouncers, so chatted with three of them: two seemed like decent, friendly guys just doing their work, one was an immediate asshole full of himself; about the norm, really. Oh, and I've got to laugh at their ""dress code"" description on their website. The place was packed full with people dressed exactly in the kind of clothing they ""prohibit"" via their dress code. LOL. Got to laugh at the clowns running this place.
- Saphire was a lot of fun, but not without the usual fight/cops drama.
- Safari Ridge adventure paintball is very worth visiting, especially for off-hours/private games (as we did). Tons of fun. In the group of 8, we went through 4000 rounds of paintballs over ~2.5 hours (info for future budgeting purposes). The groom took his punishment like a man. 
- Katana Hotel was a great place to stay at. Nice rooms, clean, quiet, good stuff, good continental breakfast, easy to find parking, solid WiFi.
- Lots of excellent, smaller, ""family""-style restaurants downtown. Really great vibe, food, service. Impressed!
- Chain-style restaurants all seem to have utterly shit service. Expect them to not place your food orders, screw things up, and take literally hours while the place is half-empty. Same thing at numerous different places.

Overall a great weekend. Will be coming back to most spots!",kelowna,Followup: Last minute stag thoughts / ideas?,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/9gkrc3/followup_last_minute_stag_thoughts_ideas/
