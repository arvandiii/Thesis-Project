A family member and I are visiting Vancouver Island for the first time for four nights in September, and I would appreciate a quick sanity check on my rough plan:

My plan is to put our rental car on the ferry to Nanaimo early tuesday morning, ~~venture up perhaps only as far as Hornby Island or so~~ before heading down to Port Renfrew via BC-18 W and Pacific Marine Rd for two nights. After that we will take 14 eastwards to spend two more nights in Victoria or the Cadboro Bay area before heading back to the mainland from Swartz Bay on friday morning. I figure using both ferry routes gives us a natural way to drive through the southeastern part of the island and stop at places along the way.

Still filling in the details, and I am / will be flipping through all the super helpful prior tourist threads here. Being mindful of the unfortunate fire situation + road closures, I wanted a sanity check that this basic plan makes sense?

(Definitely avoiding trying to shoehorn in any Port Alberni or Tofino adventures -- as I understand it between tourist season, road closures, general distance, and so on, that would just be a really bad idea right now.)

**Edits:** Forgot to mention that ~~I had already bought flexible ferry tickets~~ I already have prepaid ferry reservations on bcferries.com, and I must have brain cramped on Hornby Island. For some reason I thought that was connected by bridges, not ferries. Scratching that from the itinerary per your suggestions.

Also, didn't expect to wake up this morning to so many responses; it's not always my experience on reddit, and I really appreciate it.

Also, this is a PSA that you may want to avoid clutter in your garage during Vancouver Island's hot and dry weather, as even the slightest spark can set your flammable belongings ablaze. 

It was late when one of the neighbours began screaming outside in the courtyard, and a great wail of barking had begun as well. The smell of smoke was thick in the air by the time everyone got out to see what was going on, and it wasn't long before everyone realised the garage of one of the townhouses was on fire. No one knew what started the fire, and the SFD is still searching for the spark, but what the homeowner did know was that there was a great deal of flammable material in the garage that could quickly spread to the rest of the houses and bushes beyond. The homeowner called 911 the moment she had her phone, but the blaze was going up quick and the complex's residents weren't sure how long it would stay in the garage.

Three minutes.

Three minutes was all it took for a fleet of three engines to arrive. When each second counted, when a small fire could turn into a blaze that could burn down several homes in a matter of minutes, especially in the hot and dry weather of earlier this week, they arrived and moved quickly. Within a matter of minutes after their arrival, they had broken through the garage window, doused the flames, then lifted the door up to deal with what remained.

This is just a huge thank you to the Saanich Fire Department for their quick response, and their care for the homeowner, whose asthma and anxiety pair was taking its toll on her. We've heard countless stories about how firemen are heroes, and this is just one story to add to the pile.

We're doing it again this February. Dark Sounds features acclaimed poet and philosopher Jan Zwicky, poet Garth Martens, and two of Canada's top flamenco artists, dancer Denise Yeo and guitarist Gareth Owen.

Our focus is grief, death, and the climate crisis. Endings, disappearances, cultural cataclysm. Little deaths that pile up while, all around us, the smoke steeples the horizon.

Already, over 45% of tickets are sold. We're offering limited discount tickets if you act now:

In traditional flamenco, the dancer and guitarist improvise in relationship to the singer and no two performances are the same. Here, they take their cue from the poets. Answer the force of language with their own rupturing energies. Embody something a bit like fire or wind with their precision and rhythm and silence. Here, the ugly faces we were taught to hide are loose, tied to what’s true and uncomfortable, hard to bear. Anger, despair, accusation. Our culpability. Our ferociousness. Our full sob. Our rage. Our love, too – the invocation of our attention. With no hope of rescue, this is grief that honours what we’ve lost, what we’re going to lose. In true flamenco form, we’re asked to listen, our entire being to listen, before we improvise.

I wanted to get this off my chest as I am alone while my daughter naps and would like to share with others who are dealing with this post-apocalyptic world. I've been leaving my windows closed to prevent the smoke from getting in as the air quality is (surprise) extremely poor. Unfortunately, the stagnant, smokey air in my house just set off the fire alarms, even though I  have two large fans on the main floor and three upstairs all running. I don't know if this has happened to other people, or they are going to have it happen to them, but it seems like a lose-lose situation in my household.

On Vancouver Island we are so lucky to have Strathcona Provincial Park up island to provide us with beautiful hikes, climbs and backcountry camping.

Understandably, with the closure of borders and other recreation options, Strathcona has seen an influx of visitors. Unfortunately, some visitors are neglecting to familiarize themselves with the “rules” of the park and backcountry adventures and if it continues and progresses, Strathcona as we know it will change for the worse in many ways.

The rules of the park keep both the park/environment and visitors safe. Here are some the major ones:

1. **LEAVE NO TRACE –** Carry out what you bring in! Garbage cans are not provided and anything you leave there will have to be carried out by other visitors. Pack an extra plastic bag to put your waste in if you are creating any. Make sure you walk on designated trails or boardwalks. Don’t place your tent on a wildflower meadow. Don’t pick flowers. Don’t disturb wildlife.
2. **ABSOLUTELY NO FIRES! –** Campfires are not permitted in Strathcona Park unless there is a BCParks installed steel ring. No permanently installed steel ring, no fire!!! It is posted on every sign at the trailhead. DO NOT have them! As the majority of the park exists within the subalpine terrain, you will ruin the sensitive ecosystems. Oxygen is considerably lower up there. The plants that exist in those ecosystems grow very little each year. If you damage them with smoke and heat, or pick them to use as fire starter, they may not grow back and as more and more people have fires we will slowly lose these wonderful areas. Additionally, if you start a fire out there it will be A LONG TIME before fire rescue comes. If you need to have a fire, go anywhere else on the island!
3. **CAMPING IS NOT PERMITTED IN DAY USE AREAS** – Please camp in designated areas. These are clearly marked on the trailhead signs and within the trails. DO NOT camp right next to lakes unless there is a designated area. People have been camping right at some of the beautiful Instagram lakes and it’s really disrespectful to people who are there to enjoy the scenery and don’t get to because they’re full of tents and campers and fire remains that shouldn’t be there.
4. **DO NOT USE SINKHOLES AS TOILETS! -** Some hikes have beautiful sink holes scattered throughout. While they may appear to be natures toilet, they are part of the water system. Water flows from these sink holes to underground streams and eventually makes its way back to the lakes that are used as drinking water. Dig a hole in an appropriate area that won’t be noticed by others or bring bags and pack it out.
5. **DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TRAILS –** The majority of hikes in Strathcona are up into the mountains. They are considerably more difficult than anywhere else on the island. Prepare yourself. Read trail reports on All Trails or similar sites. Pack accordingly. Don’t overestimate your abilities. There are few things as humbling as a mountain – things can go wrong quick. People post beautiful pictures on Facebook/Instagram/YouTube and others are going out unprepared and require help from other hikers and search and rescue teams. You need to be able to hold your own out there and if you can’t, don’t go.
6. **DRONES ARE NOT PERMITTED -** Drones are classified as aircraft and fall under federal jurisdiction. Drones are regulated by Transport Canada.

We are so so lucky to have such a beautiful place so close and the freedom to explore it as we please. Please keep it that way!

If it’s not respected, we will lose that freedom and BC Parks will need to begin regulating it like many other parks across the world are with permit systems and limited visits.",VancouverIsland,"PSA – If you enjoy Strathcona Provincial Park, please respect it!

The priority for the detour route is to ensure the movement of essential goods, such as fuel and food. To support this, beginning Sunday, June 11, four piloted convoys specifically for commercial vehicles will be guided along the detour route, to and from Port Alberni. These scheduled convoys will occur daily until further notice.

The piloted departure times are as follows:

* daily at 5 a.m. leaving Lake Cowichan

* daily at 10 a.m. leaving Port Alberni

* daily at 3 p.m. leaving Lake Cowichan

* daily at 8 p.m. leaving Port Alberni

Commercial vehicles will also be permitted to travel outside of these windows, however, there will be no pilot vehicles at those times.

Other drivers will be placed behind the convoys because the priority is the movement of essential supplies, such as fuel and food.

Highway 4 remains closed at Cameron Lake Bluff due to a wildfire in the area. The next update on reopening will be provided after the weekend.

Here is a [PDF map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPNLX_8nTuoG8MNpWL9xyGQLWhLSJY10/view?usp=sharing) for anyone that would like to take the route and here is a [GPX file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uDWnZB_Ix7bK7NNk0pfOoaRliRfHnQbY/view?usp=sharing) for anyone with a GPS app on their phone. 

Some additional notes and recommendations:

* There is little or no cell service on most of the route.
* The route is unpaved and can be quite rough with deep potholes, but any 2WD car can make it through. You do not need 4WD as long as you stay on the main road.
* Make sure your spare tire is in good shape and you have a full tank of gas before you leave Port Alberni. There are no services until Lake Cowichan.
* Tell someone where you're going.
* Google Maps is generally not very good for backroads. It's missing a lot of the side roads and navigation doesn't work that well when you don't have cell service.
* [Maps.me](https://Maps.me) is a good free mapping app that shows most of the island's backroads and will let you download them for offline use.

A detour is in place and drivers are strongly encouraged to avoid travel in the area unless essential.

The detour will route traffic from Port Alberni through to Lake Cowichan via Bamfield using forest-service and privately owned industrial roads. The gravel detour route has narrow sections, sharp curves, single-lane bridges and challenging terrain. There is no cell service, gas stations or washroom facilities on the detour route.

Regular passenger vehicles, such as cars, vans and commercial vehicles weighing less than 14,500 kilograms, can travel through the detour corridor. No over-height or over-weight vehicles will be permitted.

The detour route extends travel by four hours and includes difficult driving conditions. It is strongly encouraged to wait to travel if possible.

For drivers who must travel for essential purposes, the Province urges preparation and patience. Drivers should fuel up, bring extra supplies, food and water to be prepared for the high temperatures at this time of year, and note that conditions can change quickly. Drivers are encouraged to plan trips during daylight hours and to drive with caution.

Detour signage and traffic-control personnel will direct travellers through the detour at key decision points. Government staff and maintenance contractors will regularly patrol the detour to assist motorists if required.

Information checkpoints for travellers will be set up at Youbou Road near Lake Cowichan and at Highway 4 at Aspeden Road near Port Alberni.

A map of the detour route will be available through an Emergency Travel Information button on the DriveBC homepage to help travellers make an informed decision about using the detour route. Drivers are reminded to use caution and respect the direction of traffic-control personnel in the area.

- not too much rain
- other young families 
- clean, not busy lake for swimming
- golf course in the general area 
- lower crime
- a chance of getting into daycare 
- hikes, biking etc that is hopefully not packed

My mom took time-stamped pictures of the vehicle both at pick up (where minor scratches were documented on both sides of be vehicle) and at drop off of the vehicle (to prove that there was no damage).  

Drop-off of the vehicle occurred a day earlier and during off-hours. The keys were dropped off as advised by Enterprise. There were no problems and no damages to the car although there was no walk-around due to the fact that my parents dropped if off when the business was closed. 

3 days later, my parents received an additional approximately $250 dollars from the company.  My mom called and disputed the additional charge and was tossed back and forth between the pick-up and drop-off locations until, finally, the manager at the pick up site confirmed that the cause of the charge was a “preventative maintenance” charge from the drop off site due to cigarette smoke smell (which was actually present at pick up) and reversed the charge.  The drop off site was contacted by phone and said that was the only concern.

Now, 13 days later, my parents have received an email from their Damage Recovery division requesting my parents supply credit card and/or insurance information for damages. My mom phoned again and the claim is, apparently, for scratches documented by photos at the original pick up so not obtained during their rental.
The claim is now with the company’s dispute resolution division and we are not able to speak to the site making the claim to show them the photos and get them to drop the claim against us as they will not answer the phone.  

We *think* that the guys at the pick-up site did not document damages in writing from the previous renting party.   The drop-off site, now frustrated by having the “preventive maintenance charge” for smoking disputed, are trying to get something else to charge us with. 

This is a fraudulent claim by a national agency and my parents should not have to fork out cash (or a considerable deductible) to support this claim.

I will be visiting your beautiful island next week for the first time (coming from Hamilton, ON) and I'm wondering about alternative routes to Tofino (from Nanaimo), given the current conditions on Highway 4 and frequent road closures.  If we get lucky, and HWY 4 is open, we'll obviously take that, but, google maps shows two alternative routes to get there.  

&#x200B;

To the South thru Ladysmith and then west by Cowichan Lake eventually heading North to Port Alberni and reconnecting with HWY 4 (quite the detour it seems lol).  

The other option seems to be driving around Horne Lake and down into Alberni, reconnecting with HWY 4.  A much shorter option, but, it's showing 'restricted road usage' on maps for that route.  Is this road accessible for tourists driving through or is it off limits?   Is there a better option than [drivebc.ca](https://drivebc.ca) for updates on closures? I need to investigate that site further for more info, but, thought I might get some direct answers from locals on this subreddit.  


Essentially I'm looking for the shortest way to get there without being an ignorant tourist.  I want to respect the land and the laws. :) Looking forward to my visit, regardless of where the road shall take me, and, any help is appreciated.  Thank you!

- dog-friendly housing (I know it’s a big ask)
- good dive bars! I need a hole-in-the-wall pub with happy hour draft and live music where I can go be my boisterous self. Gold miners, loggers and sailors are my bread and butter. Yknow, somewhere you might not bring your grandparents if they were visiting town. 
- size of the town doesn’t matter but “cute” or “quirky” would be nice. 
- walking, running trails
- fresh seafood. Like, right off the boat. From a small business. Drooooool.
- somewhere I can meet fellow young entrepreneurs/professionals
- as little snow as freaking possible. 
- nearby rainforest

I live in Vancouver, but I'm involved in the management of a small rustic beachfront resort in the Comox Valley (20 cabins over a couple of acres).

We're trying to track down a consultant / vendor who can help us upgrade our WiFi network at the resort.

During the summer season the WiFi at the resort pretty much comes to its knees - While RF coverage is good, with 20 cottages each with multiple phones, tablets and laptops, the system that's currently in place cannot keep up in the summer. I suspect the ADSL pipe from Telus isn't big enough, and that likely the router(s) can't handle all the network address translation that's required with 100+ connected devices.

(Shaw does not service the area and Satellite is cost-prohibitive.)

We'd like to implement ""Captive Portal"" technology on our system that limits the total number of connections, similar to what you might see at a coffee shop or small hotel, where the first thing a user trying to connect sees is a login web pages.

By limiting the number of connections on our Telus link we should perform much better.

Since we have 20 cottages, it feels like limiting to 20 guest connections would be reasonable, e.g. -

- A mechanism where the resort managers give each cottage a code when they check in; each code is good for one device.

- A mechanism where the guests pick their cottage from a drop-down list and they get one connection.

...or whatever else a vendor might think would work to keep the number of connections down?

Our customers are 'regulars' who will be fine with one connection if it means that one connection works reasonably well.

For example: http://imgur.com/WQuWKT4

We're looking for a vendor / consultant who has some experience in this area who could come down to the resort, take a look at what's been installed to date and see how it might be upgraded, then quote on providing the system upgrades & ongoing support.

So far I've drawn a blank - Companies that won't or can't do it, or who don't return emails.

*** When I post this request most of the responses are technology solutions - That's great and I appreciate the suggestions, but what I need is a vendor recommendation.  If you don't know of a company or consultant who can specifically help then we're still at square one. ***

i really appreciate the sharing that happens here and the valuable insight by people that have experience in this area!

Could you help me in organizing a spontaneous or self-organized or guided tour of the ancient Carmanah Rainforest? Or to collect enough information to do it by my-self?

This is the context:
- my italian family (father, mother, 3 sons > all adults) will do a travel in British Columbia and Alberta in August. We'll land in Vancouver on 16th afternoon and we'll rent a RV on the 17th. We'll spend the 17th to visit Vancouver.
- on the 17h evening or (more probably) on the 18th early in the morning we'll move by ferry boat to Vancouver Island. Or to Victoria (arriving around 8:30) or to Nanaimo (arriving around 9:45). When taking the ferry boat and to where is linked to the suggestions we'll hopefully receive by you here.
- since we have not so many days (flying back from Calgary on the 30th morning) and wanting to visit mainly Vancouver, Vancouver Island and the Rockies (Yoho, Banff and Jasper) i'm trying to plan a tour. From this first planning basically we should move back to mainland on the 21 by ferry boat to move on.
- on Vancouver Island our desire is to visit Carmanah Rainforest and then spending some time in Tofino and surroundings

Here i'm asking you mainly help/suggestion for the visit of Carmanah Rainforest.

I would need help with around these questions:
1) Is true that to arrive in Carmanah the road are logging roads, with no asphalt but dirth path, not feasible to a big RV (and rented, so is prohibited by rental company)?
2) Until which point  and by which road accesses is possible to go by RV on good roads?
3) There are other way to reach Carmanah?
4) Could you provide us some indications on how long with the different options and from the different place does it take ot reach Carmanah? Or any meeting point for tours?
5) Do you know local people that self-organize tour there to join?
6) Do you know guided tours of that and the schedule/timing, starting point (since we could not arrive by RV till the Carmanah according to the answer to first 3 questions)?
7) Do you think is possible to find and to see the bigger and oldest trees there without a guide? Does exist any maps? 
8) As i get to know, the Carmanah trails and indications are not well mainteined or absent: do you think we can visit them without a guide? Is dangerous?

Thank you for any help,
we love nature and trees and for as i get to know we can't miss Carmanah and in the meanwhile seems not so easy to visit that.

Thank you! :)
