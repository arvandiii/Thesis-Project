New to the scene but I grew up in Vancouver and have been running games for friends for 5 years. Looking to fire up a 2nd in person group since my main group only gets to meet once a month. Here's the details:

Game: Forbidden Lands (Swedish 80s dark/grim fantasy). System is Old School Adjacent with a slant towards wilderness survival and travel.

For who: New players and experienced players welcome!

How long: We'll start with a short adventure (Shadows over Long Harbour) and then see where we feel like going from there.

When: Ideally once every two weeks on a weekend for 3 hour sessions.

Where: Unsure as of now but sessions will be at public spaces such as rented out private rooms at a local library or a table at a game store.

What to bring: character sheet and pencils, we're going old school with this bad boy. I have the books and can provide PDFs and dice.

Slots: 3 open slots for players (1 filled)

Hook: Forbidden Lands is a hexcrawl sandbox game from Free League and is billed as ""Rogues and Raiders in a Cursed World"". The dice system is solely d6 except for special cases and it's rules light-ish (crunchier than narrative games, not nearly as crunchy as 5e, Pathfinder 1e, etc). Classic fantasy with orcs, goblins, elves, dwaves and classic RPG classes like fighter, wizard, bard, rogue, etc. Being a game based on old school RPGs it's decently high lethality and rolling up a new character mid session is absolutely a possibility.

Shadows over Long Harbour:

""A shadow has been cast over the town of Long Harbour, an esteemed fishing city on the coast of the forbidden lands. Over the past few months, people have gone missing, and bodies found mutilated in the hunting grounds a quarter days travel to the west. Yet no one seems to remember what caused it. A strange darkness is growing in the forest near Long Harbour.""

A little about me:

I'm a local animator working at an indie game studio and have technically been playing TTRPGs since i was 16 (I'm 25 now) but I didn't properly start playing often until 5ish years ago when I ran a Monster of the Week game with some friends. Since then I've run a Lancer game and a Heart: The City Beneath game. I've never ran OSR or OSR adjacent before but I've pretty much put all my TTRPG energy into reading OSR blogs and the r/osr subreddit in the last few months. I've been noodling with the Forbidden Lands system as well and I made an addon for the game in the form of a tactile tiled inventory system akin to Mausritter which we can play with if we want (functionally the exact same as the base game inventory system, just represented as a slot inventory instead of a list of things). Interest wise outside of TTRPGs I'm your standard anime/manga/board games/games guy. Currently watching Gundam: Witch from Mercury, reading Chainsaw Man, Dandadan, and a few other manga, playing Tears of the Kingdom (like everyone), and dipping more into board games with my friends. I'm aiming to run an inclusive table that sticks to the tenants of OSR with creativity and engaged play rewarded. Tonally, FbL is dark (which doesn't mean it can't be funny) but I'll be trying to weave more of a spooky/dangerous air than your usual D&D 5e type tone. Basically have fun, roll dice, and respect each other is my goals. 
also in terms of location right now i'm floating between the New West Rain City Games store, Strategies games and hobbies, or a table at a library of group's choice.

I'm 25F, and I'm looking for some like-minded female friends!  I have a boyfriend, but I've come to realize that I don't have any female friends to indulge and raise up, and I don't think the weights at the gym count. Lmao

In regards to activities, I'll literally do anything.  You want to do a pottery class?  I'm there.  You want to go to a cat cafe?  I'm allergic, but I'm also there.  You want to be gym bros?  Yeehaw.  You want to go skydiving?  Idk if I could myself, but I'll cheer you on in the very least!  I'm open to doing anything at least once.  The main thing is that I need friends who click with me personality wise and vice versa.

I have a very crude and dark sense of humor, and I will make jokes about everyone and everything (especially myself!).  I don't care for social justice or activism - I would rather talk about philosophy, how benign we are in the universe, and our childhoods and who we are.  I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I'm honest about who I am and my life.

In regards to my hobbies, I love animals, music (I listen to everything), reading, videogames (WoW, LoL, Civilization, Deus Ex), fashion, bettering myself, and I'm into a lot of physical pursuits such as Latin dance, aerial dance, and I'm currently learning flow / fire dance.  My #1 passion is just letting go and dancing, so I enjoy going to alternative clubs/raves where everyone makes a point to dress their best and there's a feeling of community.

I also do enjoy staying in!  I love watching movies (I recently watched Ratatouille and Lion King for the first time, boy was my childhood missing out!), playing card and board games, and being \~plant\~ friendly and eating snacks while watching kitchen nightmares or something of the sort.

So I kind of avoid it, and I end up doing most things by myself, but I'd really like to make some new friends :) !!

I live in Vancouver and usually during this time of year end up spending a fair bit of time outdoors. I like cycling, hanging at the beaches, going for hikes, fishing, cooking, drawing, painting, kayaking, having fires, camping, sometimes I drink but not often as I am trying to get into good shape, used to smoke tons of weed but am taking a break, exercising (calisthenics since gyms are closed), eating healthy, and other stuffs. I do like pc gaming and being lazy on the internet as well. Overwatch/dota/gta/wot mostly. 

I'm a really open minded down to earth individual. Maybe too open minded, lol. I think a lot and am very self aware. I do suffer from depression and anxiety (mood disorder) which can get pretty bad sometimes, but most people wouldn't really notice until they get to know me. I am on disability assistance when I'm not working (Covid is a rough time) and I find this to be a key point in Vancouver with making friends. People seem to quickly draw assumptions and judge harshly for this which makes it hard for me to want to even try to make friends sometimes. I'm even hesitant putting it here, but I never lie about it. I'm very genuine and try to be as authentic as I can as I've been through a lot in the past and it's shown me how much of a waste it is to be anything other.

I tend to get along with women better, and find it's easier to be myself a bit more, but I'm open to anyone.

* I love to learn snowboarding again, its been a long time since ive been on the snow but i really enjoyed it then and would love to do it very regulary. Would anybody be interested in getting into it with me?  im looking at booking lessons hopefully for this week. Cypress mountain has some good beginner stuff going on and seems suitable to get a bit of confidence going. i would love to visit Whistler soon too. Being new doesnt help, ive so many question of where and how to go places.
* Public events? The holidays are coming up quick and usually cities have a lot of stuff popping up around this time. Whats going on in Vancouver? christmas market? festive beers and hot food stalls? Need company while out gift shopping? Sit somewhere, talk and people watch?
* Social spots? i had a few drinks at the Cambie the other nights and i kinda liked its vibes, any other places like that around? i like the big tables, that a random group of people can make a little small talk happily. Anyone with some board games want to hang out there for a bit? play some games? someone want to teach me to play Uno? i know a cool game thats like multiplayer solitare, it gets easily competitive. Ive been into Indigo a few times for a read and a coffee, im down for a game of chess in there some time.
* Hipstery/alt spots? where do the slightly weirder people hang out/drink/mingle?
* Bars. ive been a bartender for a long time in a chilled out pub. Do beer gardens exist here? an outside spot, attatched to a bar, where you can sit, drink a beer and smoke a cigarette? maybe with some heaters now its cold out? 
* Gun ranges. I shot some guns in europe a few months ago for the first time, never really understood why people like them so much until i fired one....Hell yes. Bigger the better. 
* Nerd life. ahh yes. Ive been into video games pretty much all my life,  i brought all my computer gear along from the uk so not giving it up anytime soon. everything from shooters to fighting games, VR stuff and space games. pretty much it all  
Any good arcades around? (dont bring me to the one that smells like pee). I read somewhere that there is on that has an entrance fee but then all the games are free? any modern arcades? like with anysorta game and not just focused on one genere?  
I would totally like to paint some miniturates, its been a while but i had a sick 40k Tyranid set that was cool to paint. wouldnt mind getting into wargames as well.   
D&D. ever tried it, really want to. looks like its a great weird time, wheres it all at?
* Movie clubs? good cinemas? ill watch it alllllllllllll
* Marijuana. UK pot culture is a very differnt story. we smoke Joints with tobacco/mix and thats a little less cool here. all this blunt smoking here is pretty mad. can you buy like herbal mix to smoke pot with? any Ents here 
* Camping, any safe group camping areas around? i camped a little when i was growing up, but itd be cool to go somewhere safe and cool.
* Walks. Ive done a lot of walking, i like to walk and explore. Got something on your mind that you need to vent out or discuss? I will listen.

I've been lurking for a while and finally mustered up the courage to make my own post!

Long monologue coming up... be warned!

For so long, I've mostly looked for friends online who lived in other countries because I was so set on running away to a better place because of how unhappy I was with myself (plus, Vancouver is expensive af). That's how I spent most of my late teens/20's. Along the way, I had found some wonderful long distance friends. But I think geographical differences eventually put a strain on things, in both relationships and friendships. I tried so hard to hold onto my online friends with the hope of meeting them all one day, but I've come to realize that with time, people grow and inevitably change. Virtual hangouts, like hanging out on FF14 and playing/streaming things together is all fun but I don't think it's sustainable.

I'm 32 years old, soon to be 33, but it was only this past spring/summer when I had finally saved up enough to move out of my parents' house for the first time in my life. I passed the long probation period at my job and now happily go to work. I had gotten my full driver license just last year. Things were slowly falling into place for me, and I had hoped my long distance friends, whom I had met in my mid 20's at a time when I was at one of my lowest points in life, would rejoice with me. But it only made us more estranged somehow. And finally, my best friend and lover of 6 years (also long distance) and I decided to break up at a very peculiar moment when we both realized we wanted different things.

I've lived in the Metro Vancouver region all my life and I've never felt more alone. I don't regret any of my friends of the past, but surely I can't be the only late bloomer, still-a-kid-inside person who realizes now that maybe I never had to look that far to begin with? Maybe I had been too narrow-minded about my own surroundings. I may have let a lot of other potential friendships go, due to my own inner turmoil I had going on at the time.

Needless to say, I'd like to meet people who feels/have felt like me and wants to build close friendships again, with both women and men. Over the years, I've come to realize that having the exact same hobbies/interests as someone does not always equate a genuine friendship, so I'd like for us to message each other/talk on Discord for a while before we decide on a real life meetup (I do have a touch of social awkwardness/anxiety). I think if we truly get along, we'd be able to have some pretty fun conversations, even if we won't have everything in common.

I guess I do need to mention a couple things to note. I do enjoy wine, but I am not 420 friendly nor smoke. Not really into watching sports nor reality TV shows (though I will admit, I used to watch a bit of Kardashians when I was younger and this show called Bar Rescue, to name a few). I have Reddit chat disabled, so please PM me (and if we click, we can move to Discord). Lastly... please be my age (early 30's to 40's). I'm behind as it is with all the latest memes and trends and social media stuff... if you're in your late 20s and younger, you still have time to live a real life!

About me: studied poli. sci, phil., and comp. sci in school, now work in tech. I enjoy conversing about AI and discussing social issues and ethics. I also really enjoy learning about new things so am open to discuss anything with an open mind. 

I also play the guitar when I can find time. I grew up playing jazz and would love to go to more live shows with any music where people are actually playing instruments. 

Some other things I would like to do:
- easy hikes/walking. Have some knee issues that I am working. Would like to find some people who wouldn’t mind having someone injured tag along.
- climbing/bouldering. I have done the former a couple of times and enjoyed it. I’ve been told I would also enjoy the latter. It would be great to find a group willing to take a beginner on. 
- live shows, as stated above. Particularly Latin/jazz or symphony music. Also open to some prog metal or rock.

Hoping specifically for two categories, but open to any and all!!:
-parent friends for playdates and park time 
-420 friendly friends to smoke with for my non-kid days

My interests: concerts and music (I have tickets to 5 upcoming shows, have seen 350+ concerts); photography/painting/creative output; videogames (PS and Switch); cooking/food/baking/bbq. I am a Halloween and Christmas junkie, so costuming and holiday decorating keep the end of my year busy annually. I used to hike semi seriously, love exploring outdoors. I ""dad"" so hard, so I can't describe myself without reaffirming my commitment to my children. 50/50 homebody and adventure.

I have a older boy and younger girl, both under 5, we have a car/are mobile; weekends off, kids with me on opposite weekends; dedicated spaces for kid play (70% fenced yard and a kids playroom inside)

All of us are just trying to get by in this crazy world. Looking to build up my ""village"" locally. I am a supportive, empathetic friend, who has seen their fair shade of shit and came out the other end of it with my head held high and intact. I can interact with introverts and extroverts.

-that friend I can send the most outlandish/wtf-like/weird videos and reels to, something you might reply ""wut?"" to, but laugh your ass off to and make inside jokes with me about
-friends with dirty minds, but also good manners
-friends who wanna be in on my weekly meme distribution? Usually 60-90 high quality memes direct to your inbox to have everyone wondering why you keep laughing during your ten minute trip to the toilet
-the friend who shows up and does your dishes (wait, that's a thing right? Kidding but thanks for actually reading this far)

I'm into a lot of things, such as gaming (PC/Switch), music, watching movies, shows, anime (somewhat new to anime so I would like to watch more), going on drives, and activities such as bowling, pool, swimming, biking, etc. (I'm also open to/want to try and experience new things!)

I can be a bit of a homebody but also really like going out! I really enjoy going out to eat, going out on adventures or walks, or simply hanging out at home and just chilling/kicking back (with friends, etc.) doing whatever. As long as the company is nice, I don't really mind what we're doing.

Please note: I don't drink or smoke, and clubs/crazy parties aren't really my thing.

I’m 32F live downtown Van with my fiancé and 2 cats, and would love to connect with some other likeminded ladies! I am a huge foodie, love cooking/going out to restaurants and sharing loads of appies or trying different things, love wine and breweries and fancy cocktails, really want to get more into hiking, paddling, camping and all things outdoorsy and healthy. Love weekend trips, visiting wine country and just random adventures. Weed-friendly! Love a chill evening in too cooking, smoking weed or drinking wine whatever floats your boat, watching movies. Would love to meet people who are into being spontaneous and just getting out and enjoying life a little. :) 

I am fairly centrist… I have friends and family on both sides of the political spectrum and strive to always be open minded to different perspectives. I’m not a big fan of identity politics or political polarization/ideological extremes. I am the type of person that always tries to see things from the other side’s perspective and ends up playing devil’s advocate because I feel it’s important for people to think about all sides of things and not be too quick to jump to conclusions. I enjoy healthy, respectful debate. My motto in life is basically that the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. Usually no side is completely right or completely wrong.

I also picked up a motorcycle (Indian scout 60) and got my mst. I am taking my license test in August.
My main hobby is playing magic the gathering. I've been playing since homelands. I started out playing standard but now mostly play limited formats.

I also enjoy anime and animated films.

On top of that I have a busy schedule working full-time and doing online school part-time. Before pandemic I was able to get by thanks to some close childhood friends I have.

* I'm a software developer working for a non-profit organization.  We are able to help people in Ukraine and Russia during these difficult times and that makes me very happy.

* I don't have a lot of hobbies right now other than video games. I play LOL (ARAM only) on NA server sometimes and follow the competitive LOL scene pretty closely. I also play WOW arena on the Chinese server. In the past I was a pretty big chess nerd and enjoyed swimming. I'm mainly looking to pick up some physical activities since I'm pretty out of shape right now.

* I'm especially interested in things outside of my bubble. Art, history, politics, etc. I also love my job so if you are interested in internet technologies we can talk about it all day.  

* I don't drink or smoke because I don't like them. But I 100% don't judge.

A little about me:

*  Huge believer in being proactive and fixing my own problems, proponent of stoicism and poeticism. I put it into practice every day and I would really like to meet people who do the same with their philosophy or beliefs. whether it is the same or different, I like people who believe in something and commit to it. Really deep philosophical conversation that questions and cuts into the ethical backbone of things we consider normal really interests me, and I like to be able to think through and question everything I hear and everything I say as well.
* I love reading, you can always catch me with a book (or kindle...)
* I love adventure and doing risky fun things. I'm not in the shape I was in high school anymore but I am losing weight to get back into it, and back then my buddies and I used to race eachother up buildings at night for fun and do these huge borderline mission impossible tier efforts to get into some abandoned plants and whatnot. I would love to start being adventurous like this again once I shed off those pounds that make it hard nowadays.
* I'm a software developer. I launched my career this year early to get out of my alcoholic parents' place in Ontario and now live with my GF in Vancouver. I work from 5:30AM to 2:30PM because of time zones so it isn't too inconvenient scheduling wise.
* I'm an entrepreneur. Not like the annoying ""I'm unemployed but I have ideas so I'm an entrepreneur"" type, I started a games studio with some coworkers and people I know and we're working actively on great games that I would love to talk about and share, and likewise for your projects if you have any.
* I'm an anarchocommunist by ideals and democratic socialist by policy. I'm not super politics obsessed or anything and I generally try to keep politics *out* of my life nowadays, but when it comes up, that's where I stand. I enjoy having friends from all over the political spectrum anyway but if that is a problem for you, I'd rather get it out ahead of time.
* I'm 420 friendly but I don't smoke myself. I did for several months but found it was just psychologically unhealthy for me and if I wanted to get my life together I had to cut it out. I'm open to a max of half a joint and after 9PM only. Sort of the same situation with psychedelics - I'm very experienced with them having tripped on up to 11g of APEs at one time, but found that while they were beneficial in some ways, they were harmful in others and once they showed me what I need to see I stopped using them. However, I'm completely down to trip sit as I see it as important.
* I am a workaholic. I am addicted to workahol. I work overtime voluntarily and then I spend the rest of my time working on my passion projects or certifications unless I already have plans. I don't let it get in the way of my social life but I also try not to let things compromise my work, as I like to be able to take pride in saying I created something good with my labor and if just one person enjoys it, my week is made.

I'm looking for someone who could be compatible friends wise with someone like me as I know some of those aspects can cause friction with extremely different people (ie. a non-proactive alt-right stoner would probably get into a lot of fights with me, a proactive left wing professional, I'm open to meeting all kinds of people but I like putting everything out there ahead of time so you know you won't be wasting your time if any of those is a deal breaker).

I like being active but without a workout regimen.  Everything outdoors is good - backpacking, camping, skiing, snowshoeing, kayaking, scuba diving, etc.  I also enjoy walks with my dog.  I’m lousy at team sports and would rather be outside exploring. Couldn’t care much less about professional sports.

29/M ENFP-T w/ ADHD. Currently in Surrey, but grew up in Richmond. In that awkward phase where you realize you've grown out of your highschool friends. I'm quite the nerdy type, but I spent my entire adolescence smoking weed and going to raves, then spent most of my twenties working in tech. Eventually I snapped, then went to go live and work in Tokyo for a year on a Working Holiday Visa. Since coming back though, I've been struggling to make new friends -- especially since the office closed down, and I've been working from home for the past year.

I love languages -- I also speak French (thank you Early French Immersion), as well as Japanese (about N2-ish), though I've been struggling to find opportunities to use either language these days, so I'm probably a bit rusty.

Weirdly enough, I don't play a lot of video games, despite enjoying them quite a bit -- mostly because I've been friends with people who are like, REALLY GOOD at one specific game (Dota, League, Overwatch, whatever), and it makes it super frustrating to play with them as a noob, so I end up giving up lol. I play a lot of simulator games as a result (Factorio, SimCity, Cities:Skylines, Kerbal Space Program, etc). Way back, I used to play WoW, but that was cause I had friends to play with -- I tried getting into it again when Classic came out, but it wasn't the same playing by myself. I'm open to learning a new game, but be patient with me plz :3

As for music, I'm mostly into EDM (though the specific subgenre I'm into at any given point will drift quite heavily, from Dubstep to J-Core), but also a lot of weird shit (100 gecs / food house / pc music, etc), plus a decent amount of Japanese music. Enjoyed a lot of the virtual festivals last year (Secret Sky / Square Garden), but they just aren't the same as going to Shambhala.

I grew up in the anime community here in Vancouver. Had a lot of cosplayer friends, so I ended up being a cosplay photographer for a few years. Used to watch a **lot** more anime than I do now since coming back from Japan, but I still follow up on any shows that are good (been watching Dr. Stone lately). I'm a weeb in recovery, basically.

I watch a **LOT** of YouTube -- I used to help produce a friend's channel, and I'm still very much immersed in the community. Glad I was able to go to VidCon before it got too big. I don't think I have enough of an ego to start my own channel though lol.

I reeeeally want to travel more. Once this pandemic is over, and it's safe to do so, I want to circumnavigate the globe by traveling: Vancouver > East Coast Canada > Europe > Taiwan > Okinawa > Mainland Japan > Vancouver. I looked on SkyScanner and the flights aren't even that expensive, plus my work gives me like 5 weeks of paid vacation -- I just need a reason to use it.

Other than that, I'm also into cryptocurrency, [typography](https://imgur.com/a/1aSjMLo), and VR.

About me:

25m, I am not RIPPED but i'd say i am decently strong and enjoy strength training. 

I like video games and driving to new sights and locations. 

I USED to really enjoy pub crawling and going out, but recently i feel like i need to make baby-steps to get there again. Because from the outside, I want to join in again.  

I occasionally smoke weed sometimes aswell but not as much as i used to.

\*I was hoping to exchange DMs for a while and we can talk before meeting up, just to see if we got plenty in common or not :)\* 

&#x200B;

 I used to be quite extroverted and outgoing but due to a series of events I have struggled leaving my room except for work/university/gym. I avoid eye contact with most people at this point, and I want to learn how become my outgoing self again. Just a bad time at university that took it's toll on me I suppose.

If you can relate to this maybe shoot me a DM? I'd be excited to try to work through this with someone who is going through something similar.

Helloooo everyone and Happy Friday!

I've done a lot of self-reflection over the last year and realized that I want to get out and make more friends as we come out of the pandemic. I do have a really good circle of pals but I'd love to make some more connections with people who share similar interests to me and match my vibe. 

I’m also at a point in life where a lot of my friends are getting married, having kids, etc. All power to them but I’m not ready for that stage of my life yet: I still like going out, doing things, socializing, traveling, and all in all having good times with good people!

With COVID restrictions loosening, I’m looking to meet new friends to go to art shows/museums/exhibits, hit up concerts, play/watch sports, go to breweries, etc. I’m pretty extroverted and a bit of a weird mix as a person: I can hold my own in a conversation about “serious” topics like politics or philosophy, but I’m also interested in pretty lowbrow things as well. I once took a mental age test and apparently I’m 27 years old mentally... kind of makes sense to me as I feel I'm ""responsibly immature"". 🙃

Some of my interests/hobbies include: Music/concerts, art/culture/museums, fashion (streetwear, sneakers), playing/watching sports, food/drinks, writing/poetry, tech/programming, fitness, politics/history, finances/investing, video games, and the Oxford comma. 

Anyhow, if anything that I wrote aligns with where you’re at, holla at me 🤘",Vancouver4Friends,"32M looking for new friends [fashion, live music, going for food/drinks, karaoke, writing/poetry, sports, etc.]",0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vancouver4Friends/comments/o2karr/32m_looking_for_new_friends_fashion_live_music/

Avid TV watcher/discusser....  To give you an idea of my taste, some of my favorite franchises are Star Trek, Star Wars, MCU, Game of Thrones.  
I also enjoy staying informed on and discussing politics, but I get that's not for everyone.  
I'm 4/20 friendly, a cat owner and a (poor) gardener.  I like most genres of music and generally get along with most people. 
I live further out in Metro Vancouver (but I do have a car)- if you aren't mobile or don't travel south of the Fraser, probably won't work out.  

Obviously, given current events, I'm only open to chat at the moment, but hopefully can meet/hang as Covid restrictions are eased.",Vancouver4Friends,"Feeling lonely and blue lately, hoping to make some new friends!",0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vancouver4Friends/comments/kqdjhl/feeling_lonely_and_blue_lately_hoping_to_make/
