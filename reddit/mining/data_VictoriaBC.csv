We were heading back to the island from the sunshine coast and made it to Tsawwassen at 3.40 for our 5 o'clock reservation. 

Internet said there was no 4pm so we didn't push at the booth. Agent says ""youre reserved on the 5?"" So we pull all the way down the lane and are 4th in the lane. Think, hey it's pretty quiet. Then we see them start loading a ferry.. the 4 does exist, hallelujah! They're nearly done loading the lanes and I call over to the loading team to ask if they can get us on. No dice. Booth Agent should have told us and bumped us before putting us in the lane. They estimated less than 60% full but we'd have to go around to the booth the remaining 8 mins but they can't guarantee anything and sounded doubtful. Somehow, for the car at the front of the line an exemption was made and they let them go on. Apparently they had a res for the 4 and had been bumped when it was ""cancelled""

I don't understand how they can make an exception for one of the 5 cars waiting but not the others. We see more cars streaming through the booth and rolling straight on. 

After a dumpster fire weekend they are now leaving people for a sailing when there's lots of deck space available.

Waiting at the terminal we chat to 2 other families who were booked on the 4 but had their reservation bumped to the 5 yesterday afternoon.

It makes no sense!

I've been told so many times when arriving near loading with a possible wait that they will put us in line and squeeze as many as possible on, and have indeed squeezed on. How is this different!?! 5 cars left behind for no good reason when the ferry wasn't even full.

But my goodness those fireworks. I kept on like giggling/yeah bruh'ing. At one point I said to my friend, ""ohhh, that's *fire*""! that's what it was, I'll call a spade a spade. the sparkle effect was fucking fire. Whoever did that, you are the Jason Bourne of what you do (what is your job called; I suggest 'fireworks magician' or 'fireworks wizard'.

look I get it. I have a dog, I took her to the fireworks in parksville when she was but a wee pup (covered her ears) so she would get used to it but I recognize I was blessed with a very good temperament, chill dog. I know some dogs are more reactive; they're terrible for pets, animals in general. I've also walked the beach in pville after and it;s not a pretty sight, there is lots of shit. 

I also have mixed feelings about this day in general. Canada's history of pretty much outright genocide ain't exactly sumpin' to be proud of, and the whole 150 thing was just kinda tacky. But I remembered something Tom Morello, guitarist of Rage (Against the Machine, in case you're musically unaware) said about being American. he said he could be proud because of the history of struggle and betterment, in the vein of Martin Luther King Jr. so maybe in that sense I can get on board. A coworker suggested Turtle Island Day, and I kinda like that.

But I digress. Pho boi, you being open was awesome. It was the perfect cap for a good night. you being open later is fire. they said they were thinking about being open later some nights a week. vote with your wallets ,and your stomachs Victoriazians (as we citizens of Victoria are colloquially known).

Well unfortunately we have a new regular season we didn‚Äôt have when I was a kid growing up in Victoria sixty-odd years ago ‚Äì the wildfire smoke and heat wave season - which may start any day now because most of the fire smoke in Victoria comes from elsewhere. For example you can see via the link below how the smoke from the current Alberta wildfires reaches all the way to the United States east coast. 
https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/this-map-shows-just-how-far-alberta-wildfire-smoke-has-reached-1.6390695 

Please note that I am not a professional nor an academic but just a geek interested in weather and climate. Also I do not know if/how any of these sites work on phones.

There may be no smoke now but you might want to bookmark this page for that later date when you see the horizon turn yellow or think you smell smoke.

The main issue for us in Victoria is wind direction as the fires will be in the interior, down south or up island. Normally the winds are in our favor but that is not always the case. If you‚Äôre new here you may not know that smoke from elsewhere can get so bad here as to make normal functioning difficult and be a real health risk to vulnerable people. 

Below are some handy ways of seeing wildfire smoke related information. Note that some of these sites will flash their images at first but that will stop after a few seconds once all the images are loaded. 

We'll start simple with the official Environment Canada current Air Quality Index and forecast for Victoria.

**Heat Risk**

**On June 28, 2021 the temperature reading at Victoria‚Äôs Gonzales Point hit 39.8 degrees.** There were sixteen heat-related deaths in Victoria over the course of that particular heat wave. So yes, it can happen here. 

I‚Äôll be seventy this year and I‚Äôve lived in Victoria for about sixty of those years. I‚Äôve seen the climate here steadily warming. The weather forecasters are already warning 2023 could be a particularly warm summer. 
https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/climate-experts-el-nino-bc

Here is a BC Gov website with all kinds of good info about what to do before and during  a heat wave... 

https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-management/preparedbc/know-your-hazards/severe-weather/extreme-heat 

...and the related BC Centre for Disease Control site http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/professional-resources/heat-event-response-planning

However as shown in the film series linked below the main danger is that as you get hotter you become increasingly confused and make worse and worse decisions. All the things that could go wrong are detailed in this series. 

**The series is intended as educational material, not entertainment**, something I know because I have corresponded with the producers. I am a strong supporter of this approach because I believe people learn and remember best from stories. 

This series shows what happens to people during a fictional heat wave in Amsterdam. It  will help you understand what you and your neighbors might go through in a worst case scenario. Infants, pregnant women, pets, the elderly. It is in Dutch with subtitles and each of the the twelve episodes is less than ten minutes long. Some swearing and suggestive scenes. It's Amsterdam after all.

**NOTE**

Although my intention with this post was simply to provide information to those with possible concerns over wildfire smoke or heat events in Victoria it is not surprising that the discussion has spilled over into opinions regarding the wider issue of climate change. If you are concerned about the impacts of climate change in our region the ‚ÄúFuture Impacts‚Äù section of this BC Government webpage will be of interest.

There is just about nothing to do in this city without a car. I've lived here for 5 years (which is probably part of the reason I am bored), and I have done just about every activity I can that is a walk/bus/bikeride away.

Here's the problem:

Most of the activities you can do in Vic (without a car) are touristy, once-a-year type of activities (e.g., the Bouchart Gardens, Parliament, whale watching, Royal Museum, etc.). There are very few things you can do year-round and on a consistent basis (drinking, I guess... If you can afford it and enjoy it). In comparison, many other cities have unique and tight-knit communities/scenes that you can join, but for Vic, the only community that has any significant prominence is the climbing community (love you climbing folks, no shots fired). It just feels like a dead place. I swear, these are the only demographics in this city: UVic student, public service employee, climber, or, retired.

Anyways, there's my rant. And I'm sorry to be so negative. Please, if you think I'm overlooking fun things to do in this city, let me know! How do you guys spend your free time here?!

But christ on a cracker, my other 2 sons, his dad, me.... we've all visited a bunch of times over the last year.  Ytf would you drop one kid in a family??  

Anyway.  I guess I'm grateful I even *have* a GP office to screw me over.  But still.  That's insane.

- Cineplex and IMAX movie theatres 
- Rooms at the Saanich rec centres
- Ritual Nordic Spa
- Dino Lab (this may not be 100% private) 
- Fired Up!
- Wildplay (group bookings, not 100% private) 
- Pool rental at SEAPARC in Sooke

I would also be interested in knowing what restaurants have a private room that you can rent out. The only ones I know of are: 
- Moxies 
- Bard and Banker 

Other types of venues:
- Heartwood and Co has an event space upstairs 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Also anything in the Greater Victoria area works.

I thought I would add the suggestions I have gotten:

- Quazzars Arcade 
- Parkside Hotel (movie theater)

Wow people really get fired up over the simplest conversation. This was not intended to shame anyone‚Äôs lifestyle choices. It was simply a thought coming from a very very very tired parent who thought it might be nice to have some healthier to go food options for the odd time our family would like to utilize drive thru‚Äôs. 99% of our meals are cooked at home, we never ever get fast food. There are the odd days that I figured it might be nice to just have somewhere better then McDonalds or Timmy‚Äôs to grab food and go, super simple. No judgment on other peoples means of transportation, food choices or environmental decisions. 

Of course more fast food chains will continue to be developed around town, so instead of just adding another typical fast food joint, add something that has healthier choices.

Original Post:

As a parent, I‚Äôd love to have the option to go to a healthier drive thru option with my child. Also, I noticed we are lacking these type of healthier ‚Äúto go food‚Äù places near the quadra/McKenzie area. I think root cellar is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù option but it‚Äôs so over priced for food to go. Other then that there‚Äôs only the typical unhealthy fast food drive thru options in that area.

I thought I could tackled it myself, but research shows that baffle weights over 10kg and is very difficult to remove unless you work with these stoves regularly. 

Anyone have any recommendations on who to call? I assume the bird / animal will die in a day or two; as much as I'd like to save the bird, it's not a priority. Even less so if its a rodent.

Also, what would happen if I just lit a roaring fire quickly? The baffle area is an ""afterburner"" of sorts, getting super heated and hot enough to burn away smoke, (at least that's what I was told); if the bird is sitting on top of it, it would put it out of its misery pretty quick, but would it all turn to carbon, or potentially cause a chimney fire?

The heat wave will be worse and last longer in California where there are already large fires.

Please note that I am not a professional nor an academic but just a geek interested in weather and climate. Also I do not know if/how any of these sites work on phones.

There may be no smoke now but you might want to bookmark this page for a later date if you see the horizon turn yellow and think you smell smoke. 

The main issue for us in Victoria is wind direction as the fires will be in the interior or down south. Normally the winds are in our favor but that is not always the case. Watch this video of a smoke plume from a current California fire expand across hundreds of kilometers and head in our direction in a matter of hours.

There have been a lot of large wildfires in Canada's north and Alaska this year but the winds don't drag the smoke in our direction. Usually. 

Below are some handy ways of seeing wildfire smoke related information...

We'll start simple with the official Environment Canada current Air Quality Index and forecast for Victoria. Currently all good.

or here https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality/aqhi

The following link will show you smoke forecast maps. In the chart, click on a number in the ""Vertically Integrated Smoke"" row. The range of clickable numbers (time) will change as daily data is calculated. You can also click on the ""Loop"" check-mark in that row to see an animation.
WARNING: if you choose ""Loop"" it will flash rapidly at first as it loads images.

https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPsmoke/

Go here and you will see the smoke (and clouds) very clearly in animated, near real-time (satellite). 
*This page will also flash initially.*

If the colors look funny it's night and the satellite is using infrared.

Also you can go here and see the winds that are driving the smoke. You can also view air quality on this map and tons of other related stuff.

**A MANDATE OF EQUILIBRIUM**

*(because calling it Politically Enlightened Austerity is too frightening)*

&#x200B;

I've spoken well before and have written well before, generally without concern of speaking or writing well. I am a high school dropout with an anxiety-fueled appreciation of academia. These things you need to know about me as I hum and haw at whatever official podiums are offered during Victoria's upcoming mayoral race.

&#x200B;

My platform is radical and, on the surface, ridiculous. I would see a reversal of the condominium hellscape growing around us. I would see a total correction of the brazenly-imposed addiction epidemic, and I would see the inception of a globally-renowned volunteer gardening project that would blanket this city in food.

&#x200B;

These things are easy to say, bringing to mind the dichotomy between what can be considered as 'the noble ideal' versus what can be considered as 'the noble reality'.

&#x200B;

The 'noble reality', once I became mayor, would be that almost every initiative offered will be resisted at almost every level. Leaving my power and authority to, at best, vote no where a generic establishment mayor would vote yes and vise versa. Surprisingly, with significant support coming from a suppressed police community which stands to have the respect and honour lost under Victoria's long standing municipal cabal rekindled. Presupposing I'm not assassinated day one.

&#x200B;

The 'noble ideal' being an acceptance of the truth of the 'blue bridge' scandal. That we did not incur fantastic debt because we needed to replace it, we needed to replace it to incur fantastic debt. $120,000,000+ to build an earthquake resistant bridge that isn't earthquake resistant. Putting the City in an unfortunate position where it must build up and steal the sky in an attempt to put ourselves in the black. A cultish lack of foresight pretending there will always be enough food and water for an exponentially expanding population.

&#x200B;

The 'noble ideal' being an acceptance of the truth that the addiction epidemic has been imposed by those who see only danger to the housing market upon the normalization of tent-cities. That crack, crystal meth and heroin has invaded our streets and crushed the peace of public spaces not as a natural consequence of rampant and 'immoral' capitalism but instead as a phenomenon that has been literally fostered and allowed, to imbue into the minds of the public the 'inherent unfeasibleness' of living rent-free in public.

&#x200B;

**REGARDING THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET**

&#x200B;

We are ridiculously in debt yet pretending affluence in an attempt to not frighten off investors. I, on the other hand (being a poverty-avowed monk) see the legitimacy that would be gained via prioritizing a non-psychotic escape from our current indentured state. Instead of arbitrarily building as many skyscrapers as possible to simply give the appearance of revenue generation we would acknowledge that the world is actually entering an almost unimaginable financial collapse and do everything in our power to find fiscal balance without actually resigning ourselves to the backroom schemes of manufacturing consent. 

&#x200B;

Equating austerity with maturity we will sell every non-essential municipally-owned asset, criminally investigate the 'blue bridge' nonsense (ultimately seeking complete forfeiture of personal assets to the municipality from those who signed off on the loan). We garnered fantastic debt implicitly depending on the capacity to build condos everywhere. Ceasing the condo construction means finding a way to escape our indentured status that doesn't include this acceptance of normalized psychotic marketing to arbitrarily attract people to come pay rent here.

&#x200B;

**ON POLICING**

&#x200B;

As Mayor of Victoria I will work to initiate a new, free/creatively-affordable, deputy training program. Which will be overseen by police veterans and martial instructors who will teach conduct (protocol, the nature of conscientiousness and why innocent presumption is so important) and combat taijutsu. I've in mind a grand obstacle course that will attract the respect of police forces and militaries worldwide.

&#x200B;

As it stands, this City has adopted a philosophy of facade. No longer will we insist on 'keeping up appearances' by buying new police cars every year, instead we'll enjoy maintaining what we already have. That said, I've seen the usefulness of having one or two personal flying machines (akin to the Flyboard Air) at the disposal of the City's emergency services.

&#x200B;

If by the time I would become Mayor there is still capacity to select the Chief of Police I will be doing so from within their own ranks.

&#x200B;

**ON THE CORRECTION OF THE ADDICTION EPIDEMIC**

&#x200B;

The inception of a 'diversion' (in the category of 'community service', allowing the waiving of charges if certain conditions are met) of a 3-4 month detox (where tobacco and marijuana are available). The program would also accept voluntary intakes. For this to work we will also need strictly dry (from crack, crystal meth and heroin) tent-cities so that those in the program are not faced with having to pretend to love the system that inspired their addiction in the first place to reintegrate into society.

&#x200B;

Simply, we cannot afford to acquiesce to the faux progressivism any more. What we've done is monstrous. Like putting out a million bird-feeders knowing full well we only have enough feed for a very short amount of time. Every addict has been a pawn. Responsibility for every life and family that has been destroyed lies on the doorsteps of City Hall and the Chamber of Commerce and whatever other forces that helm the politics of Victoria. Anywhere else we'd be calling it a war crime.

&#x200B;

The amount of money spent buying and maintaining converted hotels and providing food and services (for years now) would have covered the cost of mass detox multiple times over.

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the pandemic the province of BC was given 5 billion dollars in an effort to help us through. I imagine Vancouver Island/Victoria was given a fifth of it. When it runs out (I would guess within the next couple of years) what will we have to show?

&#x200B;

**ON TENT-CITIES AND GARDENS**

&#x200B;

Tent-cities cannot work without the cooperation and sanction of the City. The bad addictive drugs have been a perfect weapon in helping the general public not care about obviously Charter violate Bylaws that insist the public doesn't have the right to sleep during the day.

&#x200B;

You know why Cities put themselves in debt? Because declaring states of emergency is bad for tourism. In the fall of 2008 this city was given the rarest opportunity with the BC Supreme Court's acknowledgement of sleep as a right but foresight was hidden under it's greed. So instead it escalated the problem while removing opportunity to set a learned foundation. They call it politics.

&#x200B;

I see Charter compliant community driven tent-cities that are populated with those who know ALL obnoxious behaviour may as well be a professional affront to sow disrepute. I see family tent-cities, I see student tent-cities. I see gardener tent-cities. I see traveller tent-cities. All appreciating the natural bounds of tent-city's existence.

&#x200B;

With the notoriety of being the first city in the Commonwealth to sanction tent-cities of course there will be risk of attracting the poor and rent-adverse from all over Canada. Which is why it will be incumbent on the City to let every other municipality in the nation know of the precedent set in the BC Supreme Court so they they can establish their own responses in their own towns.

&#x200B;

Speaking of gardens. The City will engage in a popularization of insightful gardening, offering a path to those born to it. AKA food grows on trees and healthy sleep is mechanically possible without rent. With all parks departments at our disposal there is great advantage. Every lawn owner given the option to take half the produce if their space can be managed by the volunteer project.

&#x200B;

**VACCINE MANDATES AND MY TINFOIL HAT**

&#x200B;

Why is it so hard for people to conjecture a scheme to cement global domination coming from within our own government? Many are indignantly vocalizing the stress of staffing shortages only months after firing thousands. Even the primary homeless association, Our Place Society, will not have completely healthy non-vaccinated people help mop, do dishes or fold towels, even while their own staff are going bonkers with the stress of a wholly unnatural circumstance.

&#x200B;

As the mayor of Victoria I would not bother working to outlaw the Freemasons beyond just shining with the truth so much so that they would simply diminish, drowning in their shame. I very much have a beautification project in mind for their 'Grand' temple at 666 Fisgard (side note: look up 666 Pandora Avenue on Google Maps).

&#x200B;

The world is changing and to survive we will need dependence on community. Time to be bold and stoic, challenging all our subtle complicities and preconceptions. We just have to know how bad it is to let the darkness rule the night. AKA it is abominable that a municipality put itself into debt.

Prosecutor said man was homeless, wanted to be arrested, and ¬≠carried out an increasing level of criminal activity until he ended up in jail

A man who ran over a Victoria police officer with a stolen car outside Our Place last September has pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and assaulting a police officer with a weapon.

Chance Kenton Nichol, 29, also pleaded guilty to mischief for smashing the windows of two downtown businesses on Sept. 26, 2021.

The admissions of fact, read into the court record by Crown prosecutor Patrick Weir, reveal that Nichol was homeless, wanted to be arrested and ¬≠carried out an increasing level of criminal activity until he ended up in jail.

The spree began around 1:30 p.m. on Sept. 26 when Nichol used rocks to smash the windows of an office building on Douglas Street and another on Broughton Street. Witnesses called 911, but fire and police were already on the way because the motion-sensor fire alarm had been triggered when Nichol entered the building, the admissions say.

Police didn‚Äôt find anyone and called off the search. At 4:37 p.m., the building manager found Nichol asleep in a room on the first floor that had been locked from the inside. Police arrested Nichol and drove him to the parking lot of McDonald‚Äôs on Pandora Avenue, where he said he lived.

When Nichol learned he would be released, he insisted the officers were obliged to take him to jail because he was homeless. They explained they were obliged to release him.

Nichol wanted to be taken to hospital, but because he didn‚Äôt appear to have any medical issues, the officers simply gave him directions to Royal Jubilee Hospital. They watched him throw away his release documents and go inside McDonald‚Äôs.

At 9:10 p.m., police were called to McDonald‚Äôs because Nichol was refusing to leave. An officer escorted him out of the restaurant. But he demanded to be arrested and banged his fists on the police car. Nichol asked to go to the Victoria Sobering Centre. The officer dropped him off, but he was not admitted.

Around 12:30 a.m., Nichol was taken by ambulance to the hospital, complaining of heroin withdrawal. He was discharged at 7:30 a.m. because he would not co-operate with treatment. Nichol took a bus to Oak Bay and found some car keys in the 1300-block of Beach Drive that he was able to match to a 2008 Cobalt parked nearby, the admissions say.

Nichol stole the car and ended up on Pandora Avenue, where police were assisting bylaw enforcement officers. He stopped behind a marked police vehicle. Const. Todd Mason, a 12-year-veteran, stood by the driver‚Äôs side window of the police vehicle talking to two officers.

Nichol pressed the accelerator and drove toward the police vehicle. Mason tried to jump out of the way but was hit. The officer hit the hood, front windshield and roof of the Cobalt and was propelled 15 feet in the air before striking the pavement. The car hit a garbage dumpster and came to a stop with one tire on Mason‚Äôs ankle.

Nichol was arrested at gunpoint. Mason has not returned to work, the admissions say.

Provincial court Judge Robert Higinbotham ordered a presentence report with a psychological component to assist at sentencing. Nichol is expected to set a date for his sentencing in mid-June.",VictoriaBC,Man who ran over police officer outside Our Place wanted to go to jail,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/tu04tx/man_who_ran_over_police_officer_outside_our_place/

Our last frost date was technically between March 1 and 10, but I saw frost on the ground in the mornings a few days ago. That's just one example.

So if you're trying to get your spring garden fired up, here's some thoughts and resources.

First, we're super blessed to have some really good local resources for starting and veteran gardeners. One of the first resources you should check out is [Growing Food Together](https://www.growingfood-together.com/), a local website and resource. If you are on a fixed income, they will even [provide you with starter seedlings for a wide variety of plants](https://www.growingfood-together.com/get-growing-victoria) between May 15 and early June, so mark that in your calendars.

Another excellent resource is the [Master Gardeners Victoria](http://mgabc.org/content/victoria) website. Victoria has it's own larger ""micro climate"" setting, encapsulating dozens and dozens of even smaller micro climates, and resources like Master Gardeners Victoria and Growing Food Together both help you with hyper-local growing information.

What you should be doing right now if you want to get your spring garden going:

* clean up and refresh your raised beds. If you haven't already done so, a light tilling and addition of compost to your raised beds is always beneficial to a long growing season this summer. Pick out the weeds, give the top a dressing and move a bit of soil around. Even practitioners of the ""no dig"" gardening style popular in some corners could benefit from a gentle raking of the top layer.

* refresh and turn over your portable growing areas. If you do a lot of grow bag / 10/20gal potter growing like I do, given these are much smaller soil masses, do what I do: dump all that soil onto big tarps, toss in a good amount of compost along with some organic pellet fertilizer, and refill the bags. To expect them to have the same performance last year without a real tilling is is a bit of a pipe dream ;)

* get early spring seeds into the raised beds now. Things like peas, lettuce, broad beans, spinach, arugula, are all set to grow in these conditions, right in the soil without the need to do seedling starts in small pots or seed starters. 

* you can start your root veg now too, outdoors. This means time to start planting your seeds outdoors for turnips, parsnips, carrots and other root veg you want this summer. The next few weeks is when you put your potatoes into the ground.

* start seedling trays for some summer plants. Now is also the time you start your tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, leeks, etc into 6 cell (or larger) indoor seedling trays. Give them slight warmth for their start, and give them a ton of light for the development stage. You should be able to migrate them outdoors for a second stage growth in pots in late April, early May, then do the final transfer of them into the ground mid May.

* Don't start pole beans yet; my experience with starting pole beans inside under lights and with warmth is once they start, they go FAST, so if you start them now, they're going to be stunted and screwed up by the time you want to get them in the ground, around Mid May. Start these in early / mid April.

As for raised beds vs portable growing mediums (grow bags etc), i tend to do early peas in both, with the intent of harvesting them no matter what by mid-late May; they provide really good nutrients and nitrogen to the soil, and I do get some harvest from them. By mid-end May, a lot of my portable growing mediums get their own cherry tomato plants, which do well and thrive because of the combination of a) good tilling at the start of the season, b) inclusion of long-release fertilizer in the soil at season start, and c) the nitrogen and nutrients the pea growth provided.

ADDENDUM: One person messaged me asking about sources for 6mm greenhouse plastic for raised beds, building your own greenhouse, lean tos, etc, to protect against frost and extend your growing season. We have an excellent shop here on the Peninsula that cuts greenhouse plastic to order: https://www.integritysalesanddistributors.ca/ I found them through this sub 6 years ago.


Well, that's a wall of text, but I'll circle around the the two linked websites I provided above: they have an absolute wealth of information for anyone interested in growing food in Victoria.

First, buy yourself a utility surface pump ([like this one](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/everbilt-1-6-hp-portable-submersible-utility-pump/1000668924)) and get about 30' or longer of garden hose with it. It's just plain peace of mind, and will do 95% of the labour for you if you do see flooding in your home basement or other areas. They typically work in as little as 15mm of water, and can move up to 1500 gallons an hour. The last flood, we had two of them (one in reserve) and I have a flowmeter on the hose, and saw at one point it was moving about 500 gallons per hour. In the past, we'd have to move this water manually with a shop vac and other methods. These little $100 pumps can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars in flood damage repair costs. 

Second, buy yourself a cheap small gas or dual fuel electric generator. This is your last resort backup if your sump is going like crazy, and you're running a surface pump, and something takes out the electrical power in your house. Use these to power the sump and surface pumps, some light in your work area (if it's a dark basement at night), and even your fridge and freezers. You can buy new ones pushing 3500W or more for under $500; or look for a good condition used one - we found a 5000W Honda for $250 several years back. Have had it fired up a few times (good idea to run it several times a year), but have not yet had to use it in an emergency.

VICTORIA - 

A Victoria tattoo artist pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault Friday.

David Samuel Hadden, 36, was arrested on Aug. 19 as police investigated [reports of sexual violence](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-tattoo-artist-charged-in-alleged-sex-assaults-1.5073118) against women during tattoo appointments in Victoria.

The Victoria police investigation began in July after multiple women shared allegations of sexual assault on social media.

The online allegations prompted one victim, who had reported an assault to VicPD but did not file charges at the time, to come forward again and renew her case.

The BC Prosecution Service said Friday the judge ""has ordered a pre-sentence report which is to include a psychological assessment.""

The matter is due back in court on Jan. 27 to review the report and fix a date for sentencing, the prosecution service said.

In July, Carne Tattoo said on social media it was [shocked by the allegations](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-tattoo-artist-fired-after-allegations-of-sex-assaults-1.5017835) against Hadden and had fired him.

A University of Victoria student says large drunken gatherings over the Halloween weekend are ‚Äúa recipe for disaster‚Äù and UVic has to put a stop to it.

The student sent videos taken late Saturday from a room on the upper floors at UVic residences near Parking Lot 1 to media outlets, hoping ‚Äúto shame UVic into doing something.‚Äù

The videos show hundreds of people gathered in a square outside residences chanting and yelling, and openly drinking as fireworks are set off. Someone then shoots fireworks into the crowd, where they explode as the partygoers scream.

The student, who did not want to be identified, fearing reprisals from the university and the people in the videos, said the gatherings and fireworks happened Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and lasted until 4 a.m.

Pumpkins and bottles were thrown from rooftops of the residences and several fights broke out, said the student, adding there was blood on the sidewalks Monday morning from broken glass and fights.

The student witnessed someone drive a vehicle into the same square area in the early hours of Oct. 3, narrowly missing six women seated on the grass. And the student has also watched people throw televisions and other items into the gathering area.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for someone to die ‚Ä¶ is that when they‚Äôre going to put an end to this?‚Äù said the student, adding the outdoor parties have been happening since the start of the school year, almost every weekend.

Saanich Police Const. Markus Anastasiades confirmed there were mass gatherings of up to 1,000 people in the area Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and extra officers were dispatched on each of the three nights. Several tickets were issued for open liquor and minor injuries were noted, and at least one assault is being investigated, he said.

Paramedics were also called to check injuries. No officers were injured.

‚ÄúPeople are so intoxicated, they weren‚Äôt able to care for themselves,‚Äù said Anastasiades. ‚ÄúPeople were firing fireworks into the crowds.‚Äù

Anastasiades said calls to UVic residences this year are unprecedented as hundreds gather for weekend parties.

‚ÄúEnforcement up there, what we‚Äôre seeing, we haven‚Äôt seen before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome of them are students. Some are not. The university is being seen as a gathering ground for young people.‚Äù

Anastasiades said with Halloween falling on a Sunday, the partying continued through the weekend.

Karen Johnston, associate director of public affairs at UVic, said in a statement that many of the people who gathered on campus over the weekend were not UVic students.

The statement said mass parties in and around residence-complex buildings are not permitted for any reason, and any reported violations of that policy by UVic students from the past weekend will be followed up through ‚Äúestablished conduct processes.‚Äù

Johnston said students were reminded prior to Halloween of the no-guest policy in residences and UVic‚Äôs policy of no open alcohol containers or consumption in public areas of the campus. Non-students and students not living in residence are not allowed inside or around living areas, including parking lots and grounds around the buildings.

Johnston said large unsanctioned gatherings on campus may increase the risk of COVID-19 spread and jeopardize the safety of the campus community and first responders.

The capital region was awash in fireworks and other explosives through the weekend and Halloween night, with complaints lodged to police from Sidney to the West Shore.

Anastasiades said police have a difficult time catching offenders. ‚ÄúBy the time we get there , they are usually gone,‚Äù he said.

Fireworks are illegal to sell in all jurisdictions in the region, and firecrackers and other hand-held lit explosives are banned. Municipalities such as Saanich and Langford require special permits to light them on Halloween and only between certain hours.

But police said fireworks are easy to obtain online and through pop-up sellers outside their jurisdictions.

Far Out Fireworks, based in Coombs, claims to have the Island‚Äôs largest selection of fireworks and offers 24/7 online ordering, curbside pickup and two- or three-day shipping.

Calls to the business were not returned on Monday.

In Oak Bay, police were sent to break up a gathering of between 150 and 200 youth drinking and using fireworks on the Victoria Golf Club and Anderson Hill. That prompted a tweet by Oak Bay Police Chief Ray Bernoties on Monday, saying ‚Äúwe were all young once ‚Ä¶ but if your kid was one of the many who was partying on the grounds of Victoria Golf Course and/or Anderson Hill last night, they should return today to clean up the mess that was left behind.‚Äù",VictoriaBC,"Hundreds gather at UVic for unruly parties, fireworks shot at crowd TV sets, pumpkins, bottles thrown from buildings, witness says",0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/qlc4x3/hundreds_gather_at_uvic_for_unruly_parties/

This is one of the more ridiculous things I have heard in a while.  Smoking policy?  That's a health and safety issue and should supersede any RTA agreement in place.  What if someone else had died?

The severity of a marine disaster off Vancouver Island is far worse than first reported, according to internal coast guard communications obtained by CTV News.

The emails sent on Tuesday evening show the vessel's owner underestimated the number of shipping containers that fell from the vessel during a storm.

Originally, the Canadian Coast Guard reported that 40 containers fell from the ship in heavy seas and high winds, but now it appears there are more than 100 containers are drifting off Vancouver Island.

""The owner now believes that 109 containers were lost in the initial event,"" one email says.

The email also says that only two of the containers are believed to have dangerous goods inside them.

In a situation update late Wednesday morning, the coast guard confirmed that more than 100 containers were lost.

""It has now been determined that 106 containers fell overboard, not 40 as originally estimated via aircraft observation shortly after the incident,"" the coast guard said.

The stricken Zim Kingston vessel continues to be anchored off Victoria.

Shortly after the containers slipped overboard, the vessel also suffered a serious fire inside containers on the ship. The fire continues to smoulder in containers at the bottom of a large stack.

The last time one of the drifting containers was spotted by a tracking flight was on Oct. 24 when the container was near Hesquiat Peninsula, northwest of Tofino, the communications show.

Due to vents on the containers that allow water in, the coast guard does not expect any of the boxes will be recovered.

‚ÄúIt is command speculation that containers will have already sunk or will sink,"" a coast guard email says. ""Command speculation does not expect any containers to be found / recovered at this point.""

""A fire has reportedly broken out on board a cargo vessel that lost a number of shipping containers near Vancouver Island.

The Canadian Coast Guard says crews are responding to MV Zim Kingston, which is currently at anchor in Constance Bank, near Victoria, after receiving reports about a fire that started inside damaged containers onboard the vessel at around 11 a.m. Saturday.

A spokesperson for the Canadian Coast Guard said the Victoria station lifeboat Cape Calvert is nearby assessing the ‚Äúunfolding situation‚Äù and to act as a safety vessel.

Around 40 shipping containers on the MV Zim Kingston went overboard Friday the vessel encountered rough weather west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the spokesperson confirmed.

Although it had been anchored, the Malta-flagged vessel was ultimately bound for Vancouver, the spokesperson noted.

According to MarineTraffic.com, a website that tracks the movement of ships and other vessels worldwide, the MV Zim Kingston was travelling from a port in Busan, South Korea.""

It's really a great and fun experience for all the family, for adults, for couples, for casual fans and serious fans. I'd also be happy to answer any questions you might have about Pacific FC, Starlight Stadium, and attending the games. NB - I am not associated with the team other than being a fan and season ticket holder.

PS - EDIT - thanks for the gold whoever gave it! Appreciate it!

Here goes.

I'm a season ticket holder since day one (I was actually #152 on the wait list once the team was announced), and I love the experience and atmosphere at the games. I've also gotten to know the staff, management and a lot of the players very well over the first three (kinda 2) seasons of this new team. 

So a few things to note, my fellow Victorians:

* **This is essentially a 2nd year brand new league** so you're not going to be watching Everton v. Liverpool type matches. It is a Tier 1 FIFA league which means the sky is the limit long term, but it will take decades of steady growth and development to get to MLS / Mexican League level game play.

* **Passion is on the Field** My previous point made, everyone on the field plays their guts out. The players are passionate and focused. You simply don't see players mailing it in. They play to, and beyond their skill level.

* **Best stadium experience in the Canadian Premier League**... frankly by far. The most intimate stadium, you're right there at the action, and pitchside you can probably reach out and give the players a high five (don't do that during the game). Most of the stadium is brand new, the seats are comfortable for what they are, and there's no bad seat in the place. Management has no problems with fans moving from their seats to the supporters section or the beer garden (see below). 

* **Incredible value for season tickets**. We have main grandstand seats so they're more expensive, but you can get [general admission end zone season tickets](https://pacificfc.canpl.ca/2021-season-tickets) for $204 seat (and even cheaper now as it would be prorated for the remaining games).  That includes 14 games plus the 'caps game, includes a subscription to OneSoccer (to watch all the games stream style), 50% off a team jersey and other perks. That's a crazy fantastic value. My last season tickets for the Whitecaps were $750ish per seat and that was 6 years ago.

* **Players, Coaches, Staff all super approachable** All the players are approachable and available pre and post games, they know the fans are there 100% for them, and they show it. Players often mill around after the game, taking photos and chatting with the fans. There's no snobbery here.

* **Management goes many extra meters** Saw something amazing at last night's game. The people sitting behind us - two parents and their son - are also season ticket holders. Kid is a super fan, parents just getting into it. I told Brad Norris-Jones, the GM about them last week, so he came to say hi to them after the game, and took the kid with him backstage (I think to the locker room). Kid came back 5 mins later with a **game ball signed by entire team**. He's going to be a fan for life.

* **Eight Team League, scheduled to be 10 teams by 2023**... also, the plan is to be a 16 team league by 2028. Word is, with Saskatchewan coming in in 2023, a Lower Mainland team is also coming in, which would be a fantastic rivalry team set up for PFC in a few years.

* **Decent food and concession prices** Prices aren't insane for beer, drinks, food at the game. There needs to be more food trucks though, and that's 100% on the laziness of the food truck operators. 

* **Beer Garden Pitch Side** Yup, a beer garden (and DJ booth) both pitch side, next to the player benches. Anyone with a ticket can go and watch from there.

* **Easy Access via Highway, Lots of Parking** Very easy access off the main highway (take Exit 16, turn left at the lights on the offramp, then just stay on that road until you come to the stadium). Parking's all free too. 

* **Weekends: Pre Game Tailgating Encouraged!** Pre game tailgate parties are encouraged and very chill in terms of allowing the enjoyment of the beverage of your choice (be cool about it). BBQs going, one of the supporter groups -- TOP - charges $10 for all you can eat (they bring the meat!). Really fun atmosphere.

I'm kind of shocked that the team is only getting 2,500-3,000 for a game. You folks not attending don't know what you're missing. If you're thinking of attending and have questions, fire away.

Some excerpts:    


**Police oversight**  

>We support the creation of a single regulatory oversight body (i.e. combine the IIO and OPCC) that may include the capacity to conduct the investigations themselves. This is a way to reduce the number of overlapping oversight processes, and ensures there is financial accountability to oversight decisions.   
>  
>We support an oversight system based on understanding, mutual benefits, and corrective measures over punitive sanctions. Mediation and conflict resolution should be the primary process except in serious cases. What should be considered ‚Äúserious‚Äù should be defined and consistently applied. We highly encourage oversight processes that permit a streamlined approach for early resolution. Often, full investigations on less serious matters or matters result in delay, unnecessary costs, and do not serve the public interest.   
>  
>While extremely rare, serious police misconduct is most often detected by police agencies themselves, properly reported, and vigorously investigated with oversight in place. This must be recognized. Oversight is critical, but is focused on what has already occurred. We strongly recommend some reallocation of the high costs for oversight toward training and prevention.

**Governance**  

>Review the suitability of mayors holding the statutory position as chair of a police board. It is our view that mayors should not serve as police board chairpersons.   
>  
>Strengthen the independence of police boards and ensure improved understanding of both municipal councils and police boards regarding the powers and responsibilities of each.   
>  
>Set out in legislation defining features of adequate and effective policing in a municipality inclusive of what kinds of preventative services ought to be expected. This will assist police boards and councils in individual decision making and ensure consistency of services between municipalities.   
>  
>Consider a refreshed system of public safety funding to reduce tension surrounding costs.  
>  
>Establish a provincially accepted set of police performance measures against which all BC police services can report on regularly.   
>  
>Avoid US based concepts of direct city/mayor oversight and direction to police.   
>  
>Establish provincial policing standards for assessing police officer staffing levels in a municipality.  

**Police Service Delivery Models**  

>We recommend the province take a leadership role in the structure of policing services and consider leading regionalization where it is likely to result in an overall benefit to the public. We believe that policing and the public in Greater Victoria would benefit from a single, regional police service. A regional police service would require a funding and governance structure, perhaps based on the regional districts model, that addresses funding formulae, voting rights, and other critical governance responsibilities.   
>  
>The policing structure in Greater Victoria is inefficient and unfair. VicPD receives constant criticism related to costs of policing when the reality is that a small tax base supports policing related to the bulk of the regions serious crime, and high call volumes. Often cited statistics on costs of policing are misleading and fail to acknowledge the inefficient system in the Greater Victoria area.   
>  
>While integration of some services has been beneficial, integrated units‚Äô governance can have inefficiencies due, in part, to the tendency for parties to act in the individual best interests of their respective agencies/municipalities. This is an area for consideration with the expansion of integrated policing models. 

**Mental Health, Addictions, Homelessness, and Social Challenges**  

>Recognize that police services have, and will continue to have, a very important role in the community response to complex social challenges. The elevated role of police in recent years has been the result of the lack of effective upstream investments in preventative healthcare.   
>  
>While police ought not be the de-facto response to mental health related incidents in the community in all cases, police are, and will remain, an important part of the response to mental health crises where there is a real or perceived immediate or potential threat to public safety (actual or potential criminality, presence of weapons, violence or threats of violence) or as statute requires (i.e. apprehension authority under the Mental Health Act).   
>  
>Appropriate funding, staffing, training, and resources for police must continue to be part of the available mental health response resources in communities. Improve capacity and legal authorities to facilitate mandatory information sharing between health and police, while maintaining the very important focus on privacy considerations. Each resource possesses important information that will assist the other, facilitating better outcomes for members of the public.     
>  
>It is critical for adequate funding of health authorities to ensure appropriate proactive and reactive response in communities. Upstream mental health and addictions services will reduce the downstream impacts to front-line emergency services, including police.     
>  
>It is important to understand; however, that even very effective upstream programs will only reduce, not eliminate, the need for police involvement in response to public safety concerns. Police involvement in preventative and reactive response to mental health within specialized services (Assertive Community Treatment, Assertive Outreach, Crisis Response) have been proven in research to be effective. Investments in police participation in these models should be expanded as part of a comprehensive healthcare system.

>This fall, the province will be in the final stages of its Police Act review. We hope that this review will bring about much-needed modernization of law enforcement. We also hope it will meaningfully address the role that police have come to play as a de facto part of the health-care system.

>Many of our residents across urban British Columbia are suffering from mental-health and substance-use issues and, increasingly, brain injury.

>Added to this is a toxic drug supply, growing homelessness, and increasing stigma and anger. This crisis is putting enormous strain on our police departments and RCMP detachments, and it‚Äôs stretching municipal budgets already affected by COVID-19.  
>  
>The current police-respond-first approach to mental-health and substance-use calls doesn‚Äôt adequately address the reality of the complex needs in our communities for people who continue to fall through the cracks.  
>  
>Because there aren‚Äôt enough resources available to address mental health, addictions, homelessness and vulnerable residents requiring complex care, police are frequently called upon to attend to residents struggling with mental-health and substance-use issues. This leads to an expensive download of health-related costs to police, and therefore to local governments.  
>  
>In 2021, Kelowna Regional RCMP will respond to an estimated 4,900 mental-health-related calls, compared with 2,800 in 2016. Between mid-2017 and mid-2021, Victoria has seen an increase from 17.7 per cent to 25.4 per cent of incidents attended by police where the attending officers assessed deteriorated mental health as being a factor in the matter giving rise to police attendance.  
>  
>The magnitude of these types of calls across all our communities strains the primary functions of police. Police are being used to fill the gaps where urgent social support and health care are required.  
>  
>This takes them away from more appropriate front-line responsibilities, such as foot patrols and being out on the streets connecting with the community. It also leaves less time to fight serious crime through proactive, intelligence-led policing.  
>  
>In addition, using front-line police services to address mental health and substance use can be stigmatizing and perpetuates the criminalization of vulnerable people, while, at the same time, forcing police to deal with calls which other services are better equipped to address.  
>  
>The B.C. Urban Mayors‚Äô Caucus proposes specialized health-care teams as a key solution that will allow our police to go back to policing and will provide vulnerable people with the care they need.  
>  
>Access to mental-health and addiction services needs to be consistent throughout the province and resourced by specialized health care teams available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the same way our policing system operates.  
>  
>Currently, if someone is having a mental-health episode in one of our downtown streets in the middle of the night, there are no emergency mental health services available, there is no one but police to call.  
>  
>Current models such as Assertive Community Treatment Teams, Assertive Outreach Teams, and the Integrated Mobile Crisis Teams are making progress, but they need increased investment and capacity from the provincial government.  
>  
>Local governments rely primarily on property taxes to fund all services; this is not sustainable, and this funding source cannot meet the existing and growing need. Local governments should not be responsible for health-care provision through policing. In addition, the province should seek ways to fund civilian-led health teams for when police are not required. These teams should be available 24/7.  
>  
>Police can continue to play a role with these teams, but should be actively involved in an incident only at the request of the specialized health team or if there is a risk to public safety. And wellness checks should always be performed by health-care workers who have specialized knowledge and training.  
>  
>In terms of dispatch, having the 911 fire-police-ambulance options as the only choices if someone is in urgent mental distress does not meet the needs of residents in mental-health distress as it most often results in armed police attending health-based situations, which can escalate tensions.  
>  
>Other alternatives ‚Äî including a fire-police-ambulance- mental health option or an expanded 811 call system ‚Äî should be considered.

We have an attic venting fan installed in the tiny (1m tall) attic of our house, which does a great job keeping our bedrooms relatively cool in the summer. 

Today, the fan started making a random clang of metal on metal - very random, not consistent. My first thought is, something metal came loose, is buffeted by the wind the fan produces, and occasionally hits a metal fan blade (I am assuming the fan blade is metal - this fan system was installed before we bought the house).

My wife is worried it will create a spark and possibly a fire, so we're shutting it down until we can get it fixed.

Access is exterior only, up a long ladder (the vent is above a 2nd floor window).

The Victoria Police Department says they‚Äôve arrested a woman who allegedly set grass fires in Beacon Hill Park, attempted to steal a vehicle and broke into a home to take a shower.

Police say they were called for a report that a woman was using a small torch to light sections of grass on fire near the 200-block of Simcoe Street just after 5:30 p.m. Sunday, while several members of the public reportedly followed behind, extinguishing the fires before they spread.

The woman was found sitting near a van by the first officer to arrive to the area who recognized her on a warrant from Duncan, police say.

When the officer tried to take her into custody, she allegedly attempted to fight back before leaping into the nearby van and trying to drive away.

The officer then deployed pepper spray, affecting both of them, and the woman fled, according to police.

Police then say a person flagged down officers arriving on scene in the 200-block of Douglas Street, saying they fled their suite with their dog after a woman broke in, stole clothing from a bedroom closet and then went to take a shower in the bathroom.

While following up on the report and investigating the suite, officers found the woman in the bathroom taking a shower.

She was taken into custody without incident.

Police say the woman, who was wanted on a warrant based in Duncan, was also awaiting disposition on charges related to assault on staff at a temporary housing facility and addition charges, breaking and entering, attempted theft of a vehicle, flight from police and resisting arrest.

She was held for court Monday morning and now faces additional charges of arson, breaking and entering, attempted theft of a vehicle, flight from police and resisting arrest.

Police are now asking members of the public who have information on the incident and who have not spoken to them to call 250-995-7654 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.",VictoriaBC,"Victoria police arrest woman who allegedly set fires in Beacon Hill Park, broke into home to take shower",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/onnc0n/victoria_police_arrest_woman_who_allegedly_set/

Cities promise housing ‚Äì and then make new rules that prevent it: Politicians, most of whom are homeowners, have long failed to see the urgency in the country‚Äôs housing market

Victoria early this year approved a citywide overhaul of its restrictive zoning to get more housing built. And, then, nothing happened. Vancouver is poised this fall to approve a citywide overhaul of its restrictive zoning to get more housing built ‚Äì and city planners predict very little will happen.

How is it that splashy plans to enact major changes lead directly to an entrenchment of the status quo? It‚Äôs the difference between the headline goal ‚Äì loosening rules to permit multiple homes on lots long reserved for a detached home ‚Äì and the detailed regulations that end up undermining that goal and effectively ensure nothing much changes.

The housing market is tilted against new buyers and renters, with existing and new supply running well below demand. This is the root cause of Canada‚Äôs housing supply squeeze and blame can be pinned on local politicians who oversee rules that allow ‚Äì and mostly disallow ‚Äì new housing. For decades, the only thing you could build on most residential land was a detached home. Vancouver is a good example. More than 80 per cent of the land has been occupied by 35 per cent of the people.

In recent years, the cost of housing surged to dizzying levels. Restrictions on supply have been compounded by ever-stronger demand from a rising population. As of last year, loud calls for changing the rules finally rang through at city councils previously impervious to the idea.

Victoria at first appeared to be the leader of change. The city‚Äôs missing middle policy ‚Äì multiunit housing of several storeys in height ‚Äì was approved in January. It allows six homes on one lot and in some cases as many as a dozen, without a contentious, expensive and elongated rezoning process.

Yet the city then piled on numerous rules, including building height, parking and added costs. It‚Äôs akin to opening a door and immediately bolting it shut. The result is a policy that was supposed to help get many new homes built led to development applications of zero new homes.

Vancouver expects a similar result. City council this fall is set to approve a plan that would allow as many as six homes on one lot. The city calls it ‚Äúvery bold.‚Äù But the city plans to impose extra costs and heavily limit the size of buildings. The city itself predicts the plan will see only 150 new multiplexes built per year ‚Äì just several hundred homes. In a city desperate for housing, Vancouver‚Äôs reaching for a garden house to fight a wildfire.

Politicians, most of whom are homeowners, have long failed to see the urgency in the country‚Äôs housing market. Leaders at higher levels of government have finally moved to intervene, such as in Ontario and British Columbia.

Despite these efforts, the main problem remains mayors and city councils that are doing as little as possible. Four homes on one lot is definitely a step forward, if the rules were crafted to actually get such projects built. But it‚Äôs not enough, when the goal is to moderate sky-high prices to buy and rent. Vancouver and Toronto need to allow four-storey apartment buildings, with dozens of homes in each, to be built across the city, especially around public assets such as schools and parks. Right now, such buildings are allowed on a fraction of civic land.

While Victoria and Vancouver make missteps, Toronto shows some promise. The city in May allowed up to four homes on one lot and didn‚Äôt layer on onerous restrictions. It is a good although modest first step. Olivia Chow, the new mayor, has pledged to back new housing. A push from the province, with specific housing targets, has made a difference, too. Data indicate Toronto is opening up to new homes: housing starts in the city are up about 50 per cent since the start of 2022, compared with the two previous decades. Toronto, however, is an exception. Most other cities in Ontario are way behind.

Victoria, meanwhile, has realized its mistakes. The city is reviewing its new rules, to see where it went wrong, and plans more changes this fall. Vancouver city council has a chance this fall at a public hearing to also loosen its plans before it locks in rules that it knows will lead to little change.

Canada needs a lot more new housing. Civic leaders must stop undermining that essential goal by making sure the fine print supports the headline promise to build many more homes. The big picture is obvious. Getting the details right is what will make a real difference.

--------------

I am completely sick of seeing a few specific Redditors running around /r/VictoriaBC spreading misinformation and fear about the health effects of the smoke we're experiencing.

Yes the smoke is bad for you.  Yes, if you have pre-existing conditions you should be cautious.  Doubly so if those are respiratory conditions.

But for most otherwise healthy people the smoke is not going to do long term damage to you in any meaningful way.

Here's an [accessible but thorough document](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/public-information/document/wildfirev8.pdf) designed for public health officials by a consortium of people including authors from the California Department of Public Health and the EPA.  Please note that California is not exactly known for understating health risks.  

Here are some excerpts from that document:

> One concern that may be raised by members of the general public is whether they run an increased risk of cancer or of other chronic health conditions (e.g. heart disease) from short-term exposure to wildfire smoke. People exposed to toxic air pollutants at sufficient concentrations and durations may have slightly increased risks of cancer or of experiencing other chronic health problems. However, in general, the long-term risks from short-term smoke exposures are quite low. Short-term elevated exposures to wildfire carcinogens are also small relative to total lifetime exposures to carcinogens in diesel exhaust and other combustion sources. 

also:

>Epidemiological studies have shown that urban firefighters exposed to smoke over an entire working lifetime have about a threefold increased risk of developing lung cancer (Hansen 1990). This provides some
perspective on the magnitude of potential risks from short-term wildfire events. 

finally:

>Most healthy adults and children will recover quickly from smoke exposure and will not suffer long-term consequences.

However, a [recent study](https://thenarwhal.ca/b-c-old-growth-data-misleading-public-ancient-forest-independent-report/?fbclid=IwAR0w1YhsihuKZYG2tedtUEm75qQJ7kNckqM9fw14YfbIGQSkRhqA37hq0qU) found that ""We've basically logged it all,"" and what the government claims as old growth is mostly low-productivity forest, such as small trees at high elevation.  In reality, only about 415,000 hectares (3%) of old growth support big trees (expected to grow over 20m tall in 50 years), and only 35,000 hectares of forest, less than 0.3% of ""old growth"", supports trees expected to grow over 25m tall in 50 years (the biggest trees you commonly see in photos).

Despite the small amount remaining, more than 500 soccer fields of old growth are logged every day.  Most (over 75%) of the fraction of remaining high productivity old-growth forests are slated for logging.

The BC government deosn't differentiate between non-productive and high-productive old growth forests, allowing logging companies to meet old-growth retention targets while harvesting the dwindling high productive forest.

Old growth forests are important for maintaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, preventing wildfires, and regulating the water cycle.  In contrast, clear cutting old growth leads to flooding, increased wildfires, carbon emissions, and biodiversity loss.

Speaking of biodiversity, the B.C. government has recently auctioned off cut blocks which [threaten to fragment the habitat of the almost extinct spotted owl](https://thenarwhal.ca/b-c-approves-300-clearcuts-habitat-endangered-spotted-owls/?fbclid=IwAR2hYDK-dfUgIOlgAx_fmNMe0xtFr7LdIV910Xzi3gx3w-95aZ1rw-gb1WQ).  Only three are know to exist in Canada's wild.

While trees grow back, old growth forests are irreplaceable.  They will not grow back the same after logging due to the effects of climate change combined with the long time for a forest to grow back.

The good: it took me *maybe* two hours, and cost just less than $100.  If you intend to build one of these things it will take you *not less than* one roll of duct tape - I was pretty efficient and I came close to running out with my single roll.  Though I did build it with feet as the wife doesn't like stuff to be flush with the floor.  With more tape I could have finished off the look of it but as requirements go the kit as set out in the graphical instructions omits nothing, and there are no weird surprises.  My favourite part is that you can / are encouraged to reuse (upcycle?) the box the fan came in to make the bottom and the shroud!  The unit is quiet when running and not that big (basically 20"" cube).  Box fan uses a single standard wall plug.

A few months ago, I posted information about how myself and a small handful of other sexual assault survivor-turned-advocates were fighting to have s.486.4 of our Criminal Code amended. I wanted to give an update for those of you who were interested in our work.

The long of the short of it: victim-complainants of sexual offences have publication bans applied to their name without their knowledge of consent. This means that they are not freely allowed to speak about what happened to them without facing $5,000 in fines or 2 years in jail. It also means that we have to go back to court to ask for permission to attach our names to our experience... and it gives the accused/offender a chance to present arguments why we should remain under a court imposed ban.

What do we want? Very simply...

1. Stop prosecuting victim-complainants if they breach the ban.

2. Simplify the process for removing the ban at any time during the court process and make sure that the opinion of the offender or accused is not a factor.

3. Request consent from the victim-complainant before applying a s486.4 ban to their name.

4. Provide clear and multi-lingual information about 486.4 publication bans on government websites

We have been busy - Holy smokes have we been busy!

Our petition closed with 4,900 electronic signatures and just over 100 paper signatures. Thank you to all who signed and shared our work! We are so grateful for your support!

Here's what we have been up to:

In late January, myself and a small group of survivors officially launched www.MyVoiceMyChoice.org - an initiative created by Canadian victim-complainants for Canadian victim-complainants to ensure that no one is forced into an unwanted publication ban after being sexually assaulted.

At the beginning of March, my case was the feature story on the Canadian True Crime podcast ( https://canadiantruecrime.ca/episodes/130) in a two part series about what can happen when publication bans backfire... essentially,   what happens when a shield turns into a sword. It touches on the impact the unknown and unwanted publication ban had on me and how it jeopardized  the safety of others in Victoria. The details are graphic - all information in the podcast are from my court transcripts and court related documents. It is undisputed fact and gives the full story about what happened to me in September 2015. There were parts of the trial I never heard, such as his full defense or how the defence painted my character. It also goes through the journey I had to remove the ban.

In mid-March, our petition closed and things really started to take off. We were finally getting responses from more politicians willing to listen to our concerns and MP Laurel Collins suggested we go to Ottawa  the first weeks of May to kick off Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 

While we are in Ottawa, we will be meeting with 7 senators to let them know we are lived experiences and political validators showing how bad this law can backfire. We want them to be prepared in case one day there is ever a Bill that hits their desk, they know what it is for and why they need to vote in favour if it.

Also while in Ottawa, we will get to watch our petition be tabled in House, as well as listen to two statements read out about us and our work. We are hosting an information reception with MPs across all parties invited to come speak with us and ask any questions about our cause. We also are hosting a town hall with cross party support.

It is going to be a very, very busy week for us.

As with most other victim-turned-advicates, we are doing this work in our spare time and our travel is self funded. If you are able to help us with getting to Ottawa so we can help get our campaign to get  s.486.4 of the Criminal Code amended, please visit www.MyVoiceMyChoice.org for more info or visit www.tinyurl.com/MVMC-GoFundMe to donate to us.There are 8 of us going from all over Canada to watch our work come to light. I can't begin to tell you how emotional this trip will be.

We have done everything asked of us after being assaulted.  We reported to police. We took part in our trials. We have been vocal advocates in our communities fighting for change and a result of how we were treated in this legal system and have several recommendations to make sure this never happens again.

He overdosed and was left in an alleyway to die, until some kind strangers arrived and checked on him. You called 911, gave him CPR, and administered 3 shots of naloxone. You saved his life.

He was taken by the paramedics to Saanich Peninsula Hospital where he was put on support overnight until his breathing returned to normal and was discharged this morning. He‚Äôs now resting at home and seems more willing than ever to go to rehab.

So finally we got around to coming to check this place out with my family. First of all, the place is completely dead and silent when we walk in. No music, no ambiance, nothing. On top of that, it‚Äôs freezing cold inside. None of us could even take our jackets off.

There are two guys working there but I can‚Äôt really tell if they were staff or just two dudes hanging out behind the counter.

They didn‚Äôt have a single fresh item from the menu, only pizzas were available. 

We ordered 3 pizzas and two beers. 3 of the 4 pizzas came out incorrect and they brought us the wrong beers and tried to convince us they were correct. Sorry but bringing me a lager when I ordered a Fat Tug is not hard to tell the difference.

Right after we sat down to eat, both employees went outside for a smoke. 

This place has what appears to be a brand new big fancy coffee roasting machine, a lot of money invested in overhead.

The final coup de grace was we ordered a cookie for desert and it was hard as a rock and had probably been in the display case for days.

I provide outreach services to arguably our most vulnerable and disenfranchised street-based community. (Obviously won't be saying which organization I work for.) I see a lot of shit happen and even more shit spread about our community and want to share some perspectives with you and ask you to help make some positive changes.

There are a lot of problems that occur on or near the block. It is where the main building of Our Place is, and there is a safe drug injection site right next door and a newly opened safe inhalation site right across the street. SOLID and AVI do a lot of outreach services in the area. Combined, these organizations provide food, shelter, community care, places to warm up, places for people to do their substances safely while being supervised by trained employees, opportunities to be treated by a nurse or paramedic, opportunities to be referred to detox and treatment, and more. They are invaluable in maintaining the ongoing survival of those entrenched in addiction and homelessness in our district.

However, these organizations remain chronically underfunded. The safe injection site (one of only a handful on the island) had to decrease their hours a while back, which means more people are using and overdosing in the washrooms at Our Place. Our Place is facing staffing shortages right in the midst of freezing temperatures which means they have to close instead of being able to provide space for people to warm up. The city of Victoria delayed their emergency weather protocol and the options are limited and difficult to walk to if you are based downtown (see @backpackproject_victoriabc on Instagram for more info).

Organizations have been forced by inadequate funding to limit how much they give out many things, including matches, candles, bubble pipes (used to reduce the potential harms associated with meth consumption), hand warmers, coffee/tea, socks, scarfs, and gloves. Many workers at these organizations spend a good deal of their income making up for these funding deficits, which is abhorrent that the funding situation has made it necessary. The workers are not paid a lot (usually between 20-25 an hour, 33-40 hours a week) and often come from marginalized communities themselves. That's not to even speak of volunteers and activists who raise funds for things like sleeping bags and tents.

A huge problem that I see as a worker is that funding is consistently being increased for policing this area and its population while we get a fraction of this funding. Every day at 7am, we get to see 7-8 police and bylaw gather around individual tents and demand that people wake up and pack their shit, regardless of weather or temperature. We have a 7-7 camping bylaw that exists for no other reason than to appease wealthy business owners who care more about profits and property values than people. Us workers regularly see bylaw destroying and disposing of homeless people's tents and belongings when those homeless people leave for 5 minutes to visit one of our few publicly available washrooms. The homeless people who see bylaw taking all of their possessions say ""hey, I'm here, that's my stuff, thanks"", and bylaw says ""nope, you have 30 days to pick it up from this location :)"". This is the norm, not the exception. The whole time, police are also present to make sure the homeless don't get too upset about their entire lives being treated like garbage. 

Police also just waste time meeting quotas and attempting to justify their inflated budget. @vicpd_cause_harm on instagram recently posted about how a homeless person was ticketed and fined $230 for smoking a joint outside of Our Place. I messaged the account and they told me that person also has received SIX fines for camping, at $150 each. This person obviously has no way of paying these. It's ridiculous, it is needlessly criminalizing our most vulnerable population, and it's exactly the kind of thing that us workers see but are afraid to speak out about because of how ourselves and our organizations can be negatively affected by saying anything remotely negative about police. 

The proposed city budget for 2022 is seeing a 5% increase for police. A large amount of this is to continue policing our community when it doesn't need it. We don't need policing, we need more services. The man with half his clothes off, screaming at passersby is not helped by police. He is helped by interrupting the spiral into psychosis well beforehand by community mental health workers and assertive community treatment. The person breaking into a home for shit to sell (and the homeowner) is not helped by police. They are helped by low barrier supportive housing with enough funding to maintain staff, detox and treatment centre's that don't have months-long wait lists, and basic minimum income/high disability payouts. The woman dying of an opioid overdose on the corner is not helped by police (vicpd only reversed a couple dozen in the last year while we collectively reverse more than that in half a week). She is helped by numerous, well-funded safe consumption sites staffed by harm reduction and addiction workers who have referrals to detox and treatment (and which have been found to not increase crime in the surrounding area). 

People always wonder what the best way to help is. We see a lot of donations pass through from people who don't know that the brand new $200 tent they just donated will be tossed in a dumpster by bylaw in a few weeks. The best way you can help is to have yourself and your friends tell our city council (who controls funding) what YOU think is an appropriate use of your taxpayer dollars. Without your input, they will continue to quietly defund community services while increasing the absurd policing of the community we serve. It is our right and responsibility as private citizens to use our voices to assertively inform the city that it is no longer appropriate to ignore preventable deaths and other negative health outcomes for homeless people via these poor funding decisions.

Ask me anything, and I'm glad to help write that email with you. Here are the phone numbers and emails of the mayor and council - remember that your tax dollars pay for their salaries and it is totally fine for you to contact them. You should absolutely feel entitled to their time and they should be glad to hear from their constituents.

I know the rental situation in Victoria is dire, but to see UVic itself asking for spare bedrooms is nuts (*not to mention all the comments here*). 

As an alumni, I really want to help. I'm going back to school myself and need the extra money for my own tuition. I live in a nice 3 bed townhouse with a whole basement floor that could be easily turned into a large bedroom/den/office and I know it could work.  Here's where I need advice:

\- I've heard so many horror stories of renters (either full unit rented out or a room in a house) getting some sort of squatting rights and owners not be able to remove them.How can I protect myself from inviting someone into my home (for rent) and ***absolutely*** make sure I can get rid of them if there's any hint of trouble (drugs, dangerous behaviour, etc?)

\- I live w my 11yr old daughter (shared 50/50 with her dad), so I have concerns about inviting someone to live with us (shared kitchen/bathrooms) esp. if they are a first-year party-friendly student...

**Is it fair** (?) to offer a room/office if I need to ask them to be quiet, no friends or partners to visit, no cars, no smoking, no pets, etc? If it was me, I wouldn't want to live like that, but I feel need to ask for these things since they would be living with me and my daughter.  Is the rental market so tough that a new or returning UVic student would even want to live with those conditions?

\- What is a fair/typical rental price to ask? This will impact bills (which I will include in rent), my house insurance and my quiet life dramatically. The space is huge (like a full living room, carpet, would be furnished, has a window... but it is a basement, and they would be living with an 11yr old part-time...

Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. I have less than a week to pull this together, buy a bed, clean the space and make it ready, etc.

Me and my partner are kind of being forced to move, and we went to see a bunch of places (a mix of room share/one bed apartments) and every single landlord of one bedroom apartment we went to see, refused to rent to us because they only want 'one person per house'. Some landlords didn't even bother getting back to us after showing us the place and after we sent the application and everything. I repeat, we are talking about a one bedroom apartment, not a bachelor suite. One bedroom apartment with a living ro, kitchen, bathroom, and a bedroom. If they don't want to rent it to a couple, who the heck are they gonna rent it to? I mean who can afford the rent of a one bedroom apartment in Victoria by themselves anyway? And if they didn't wanna rent it to a couple, why waste our time showing us the place in the first place? I have so many questions. Isn't this discrimination? Are they allowed to do that? 

We do fit all of their descriptions too such as no smoking, no pets etc. I don't know if it is because we're both POC, or we are LGBTIQ, I just am frustrated why this is happening.

Edit : as alot of you pointed out, we were not necessarily going to sign a co lease. We can both afford the rent by ourselves, and we did not want to sign a co lease either since my partner usually need to travel out of Canada for work, for a few months of the year atleast.

On arrival I struggled to find a functioning public EV charger. This is a normal part of my day to day operating a green business on the West Shore since I bought my EV around 3 years ago. 

There actually used to be way more chargers, but over the last 3 years I've watched as charging stations broke down and never got fixed or repaired, despite my many warnings and reports.

A great example would be Metchosin, where the City Hall there deliberately turned their charger off years ago and slapped an out-of-order sign on it because they likely didn't want to pay for it anymore. I only know this since I was charging there one day and the lady came outside and said it wasn't supposed to be working. The other station in Metchosin continued working for around a year, but has now been down for another year since it broke. 

Another example is the Juan de Fuca library, where the two functional stations there slowly broke down and never got fixed. Calling the number for City Hall in Colwood which is on the station didn't make any difference though, as they said the stations were not fixed due to a dispute over who would pay for the repairs. A dispute which has carried on now for several years.

BC Hydro hasn't helped the situation any, since they don't have any stations except the two fast charging stations at the Juan de Fuca park and ride. They built their first station there a few years ago, and also aquired the other station from Greenlots there, so now there's two. They decided to make the stations free for the last two years, which ensured that there was almost no chance of ever charging there unless you waited so long it made the fact that they are fast charging moot. 

Recently during the peak of the Third Wave, BC Hydro and the Utilities commission decided to up and change the charging rates to three times as expensive as they were before they were made free. They were .35 cents per kilowatt hour, but are now changed to .21 cents per MINUTE lol. This new rate is really unethical because the machines themselves slow down on purpose at 80% without the consumer being informed of it, and also because charging is so much slower in the winter, without using any more power. The reason for the new outrageous prices? To reduce demand so they don't have to build new infrastructure, of course.

So the end result of all this is that I decided to test a charger in Colwood which I had reported several times over the last two months for not working properly. My car had been shutting the charger off, likely due to power surges, and so I warned Colwood city hall about the problem. They said BC Hydro owned the charger, who then said it was a Flo charger. So I called them and let them know about the issue. 

About two weeks ago I noticed someone plugging in there and the station made a loud buzzing sound when they did. They unplugged, and I called Flo to let them know that the situation was devolving and putting vehicles and their batteries at risk. They made a note of it, and I figured for sure that they would have immediately come to fix the problem, and barring that, put the station out of service. 

None of that actually happened, and being desperate one morning I figured I would test it to see if it would work. I saw someone had been charging there earlier so I figured it was functional. No way that such a problem would be ignored, right? So I plugged in and heard no buzzing. I watched for about 5 minutes for my car to shut it down as usual if it was still broken. But this never happened. Instead, the charging nozzle just got red hot and started melting into my car lol. 

Luckily the damage is mostly cosmetic, but this situation could have been MUCH worse. One other EV driver comes to mind who often leaves his dog in his car for an hour or more while he sits at Tim Hortons across the street. Imagine if his car had started on fire and nobody was around to help the dog inside? Could have been a major issue but thankfully it seems only my car was melted by the broken station.

Most public chargers are taken over by retired people who have nothing else to do during the day, so none of the green businesses which were started in the last 10 years can charge there when they need to. We are all pretty much sharing about 5 total public chargers on the entire West Shore and of course none of them are in the shade which they are supposed to be for EV health. 

In the end, Flo told me that they had sent a technician multiple times to the station and reached out to Colwood City Hall who is the technical owner of the unit, and mentioned that it may have boiled down to a funding issue. Colwood City Hall however has said that they weren't aware of any message from Flo about it over the last two months. Of course I find that hard to believe considering I know about the Library chargers not being fixed for years due to a dispute over who should pay for it. 

Another frustrating element to this West Shore EV Charging Crisis is that two new stations just got built overnight in Langford near the fountain on Goldstream. Really nice spot for EV charging stations, I thought, until the next day signs were erected proclaiming that those parking spots were now owned outright by a company called Modo, who's slogan is ""we share cars!"" but clearly their generousity doesn't extend to sharing their chargers or their fancy, now privately owned and coveted *public* parking spots. 

So why is this all SO STUPID???

Look, I don't know who is supposed to be responsible for building proper infrastructure for EV users to help them get around. Maybe it's the Federal or Provincial governments, and shouldn't be the sole responsibility of municiple governments. But whoever is supposed to be in charge is simply not doing the math properly. 

I don't personally care whether or not the stations are free. To me, it seems like the solution for this is to build a ton of stations and just charge for their use so that there's money to fix them instead of literally risking lives by leaving them broken. I had a nice mouthfull of gross black plastic smoke when I unplugged the car yesterday as it was melting. So technically, starting a green business on the West Shore has left a poor taste in my mouth. 

My suggestion is for the City of Langford to take the bull by the horns and build a square area of 50 EV chargers in the back parking lot of the Superstore at the Langford Plaza. In the middle of the spots, build a large, living wall to provide shade for at least a portion of those stations at any given time. These stations don't break without being used, and as long as they're being used then they will be generating some money to put towards maintenance. 

Whoever owns them wont see any profit likely until some years have gone by, which is why they should be building them now really. It doesn't make sense that there's a boom of EV sales, BC Hydro knows what demand is already really like when electricity is free, but no stations are being built. The system is clearly stressed as it is. 

I just don't see us hitting the 2040 target of everyone having an EV at this rate. I'm also not really able to compete with other gas powered companies given the lack of infrastructure, and I've heard that from other EV based businesses like food delivery drivers who have to sit at stations really far from any restaurants, while gas vehicle drivers can sit outside the restaurants and hog all the orders. I also used to see some Geo Courier companies all the time, but never see them anymore. Go figure, these business types are meant to drive really far from their homes, like mine, so I can see why they aren't doing too well.


TLDR: There are not enough EV chargers on the West Shore and my car got melted because the stations are free, leaving no money to pay for repairs.

Solution: Build more stations (whoever) and charge fair prices for them (giving retired people a discount) so that there is money for repairs. Rates should be per kWh, NOT per minute which is unfair due to slower charging in the winter. Prices should be set to ensure EV's are able to outcompete gas vehicles, including older model EVs with worn batteries.",VictoriaBC,EV Charging Troubles on the West Shore and why my car got melted.,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/nvai9k/ev_charging_troubles_on_the_west_shore_and_why_my/

&#x200B;

Recently I (23, F) moved into a new building with my roommate and a much older man moved into the same building with his much much older dad the same month. We are next door neighbours. Since I moved in, May 1st, he always happened to run into me and I assumed it was a coincidence. Now mid-May, it‚Äôs no longer a coincidence because every time I get to my building he‚Äôs there coming in. Every time I leave my apartment door, he leaves his and comes into the elevator with me. 

&#x200B;

He‚Äôs been asking me a lot of personal questions: where I work, where I‚Äôm moving to, when I‚Äôm moving, if I drive or bus, what I do for work. Initially when I moved in, I answered some general questions as I thought he was just being friendly and making small talk, but I have started lying and giving false information now. Tonight, my roommate and I were having a discussion about her having work tonight, while in our apartment. We were using normal toned voices while talking, and we were not being loud enough for our next door neighbours to hear. We also know that the apartments are well noise proofed since we do not hear our neighbours talking on either side of us. I went into the smoke pit later and he just happened to leave his apartment at the same time again and followed me to the smoke pit and asked, ‚Äúhey, are you working tonight?‚Äù The only way he must‚Äôve heard is from listening in with his ear to the wall or something, since again we were not being loud when talking and we don‚Äôt hear either of our neighbours, so I am concerned on how he knew that. The patio door wasn‚Äôt open or any windows. His much older dad also joined us at the smoke pit to converse and I am very uncomfortable at that point. I decided to leave shortly after when I was left alone with his dad, and as I was walking back to my building I saw his dad start to follow me back to the building, even though he was still smoking when I left him. I started to walk fast and beat him to my building and elevator and got to my apartment before he got in. 

&#x200B;

This situation prompted me to not want to stay at home tonight, as I wanted to be on the safe side, and I felt he was asking ‚Äúif I was working tonight‚Äù to confirm if I‚Äôll be home alone tonight, with my roommate having work overnight and not being at home. When my roommate and I were leaving our apartment that night, we heard him once again, leave his apartment at the same time since he opened his door and we heard it as it was our neighbours door, but he took the stairs instead of the elevator. When we got to the main floor of the building, we heard someone open the side stairway door but not come out onto the main floor. I have no idea who that was, but I felt it was him coming down to check that my roommate was leaving to work for the night. 

&#x200B;

Another time, he asked me if my family was visiting. I said that was my roommate and her friend that came over and he told me he met them. I later asked my roommate if she met the next door neighbour and she said that she‚Äôs never met anyone in the building and no one has seen her going into our apartment. She was wondering how he knew she lived there with me as she‚Äôs never seen him. 

&#x200B;

There potentially could be a camera but I have no idea of this. This is just a theory as one of the first days I moved in, he volunteered to help me carry my groceries and wanted to see into my apartment and come in, but I told him to leave them at the door. Our apartment is facing the path I use to come home, so I‚Äôm just guessing that he watches me coming back home and leaves his apartment to come back in with me. 

&#x200B;

This man makes me very uncomfortable and he‚Äôs shown a lot of suspicious behaviour and timing. I have seen him following me behind me while I‚Äôm going to the smoke pit. I had to leave my apartment for the night because I felt unsafe from him and the comment he made and I‚Äôm afraid that he will continue to follow me and be creepy. Am I overreacting or am I right for feeling unsafe? I‚Äôm not sure if this is credible enough to report him?

&#x200B;

TLDR: My apartment neighbour, a much older man, has shown tons of suspicious timing and behaviour: follows me, just happens to always come in/leave apartment when I am, etc. and left me feeling unsafe. Do I report him?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! I‚Äôm moving at the end of the month. I also bought some pepper spray and let my building manager know so that‚Äôs it‚Äôs filed, but I‚Äôm not reporting him right now just so nothing gets escalated or he gets mad, and I can continue monitoring and recording the situation.

The biggest challenge now is when to move out, as I don‚Äôt want him to see me moving.

&#x200B;

A resident of a newly opened shelter in Vic West has lost his housing after an arrest for arson, and the incident underscores the need for complex care housing, says a spokesperson for Our Place Society.

Victoria police said they arrested a man for arson in relation to a fire Saturday evening that damaged a business a block away from a temporary shelter on Russell Street. Police said the man was arrested at the shelter, which is managed by Our Place and opened two weeks ago to house people sheltering in city parks.

The Victoria Fire Department said they were notified of a dumpster on fire against a building at 320 Mary St. around 6 p.m. Saturday. Firefighters arrived to find the fire had spread to the business, with heavy smoke and flames coming from the front of the building. Crews quickly extinguished the flames, but estimated the cost of the damage at $400,000. There was no one inside at the time.

Grant McKenzie, communications director for Our Place, said the non-profit is ‚Äúextremely disappointed‚Äù by the incident. They do not make the decision to remove someone from housing lightly, but they have a zero tolerance policy for crime, he said, and safety for residents and neighbours is a top priority.

‚ÄúLast night, there were 29 other people in that shelter who had a good night‚Äôs sleep because housing was available for them. We can‚Äôt jeopardize that,‚Äù McKenzie said.

Outreach workers, who can provide help filling out applications for housing, detox, identification, returning to school or finding work, do not have the training to help people with complex mental health needs, McKenzie said.

The needs of someone who sets fire to property are ‚Äúsuch a step above a local charity providing housing,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt shows that there‚Äôs such a gap that we‚Äôre missing, you know. So this person has been arrested for arson, and the way the system seems to be working, he‚Äôll probably be released this afternoon or tomorrow. And he‚Äôll be released back onto the street, because there is no place to put him,‚Äù McKenzie said. ‚ÄúThere is no place of complex care that can look into what‚Äôs causing this.‚Äù

The mayors of B.C.‚Äôs 13 largest municipalities, including Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps, have urged the province to create complex-care housing where people with severe mental health challenges can receive intensive help.

The Russell Street shelter features 60 individual pods with a single bed and bedside table, with three-and-a-half short walls around the unit. Capacity is capped at 30 people while the air circulation system is being tested to ensure safety during the pandemic.

Our Place staff have already seen the effects moving indoors can have on new residents in the shelter. One woman made the move to detox just a week after settling into her own pod from a tent in a nearby park, said Cathy Mingo, manager of housing and shelter for Our Place. She had tried to enter the program several times before, but hadn‚Äôt stayed for more than a night, Mingo said.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt feel safe, comfortable, supported enough to go. So just being at Russell Street for that one week, she felt confident enough to try and detox herself,‚Äù she said.

Mingo said she has watched residents of other supportive housing sites managed by Our Place move on to their own housing, reconnect with family, go back to school to earn a high school diploma and start jobs for the first time in years.",VictoriaBC,Vic West shelter resident loses housing after arson arrest,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/ne6dz4/vic_west_shelter_resident_loses_housing_after/

the neighbour across the hall (NATH) is so much. I moved into this apartment in august. since september, I've had to call the cops on NATH over 30 times for hearing violent fights. the suit is technically a womans but theres 4-10 people in the suit at all times, always loud violent men. All suits in this building are one bed one bath. I leave for work at 3:30am and there are always (clearly wacked out) people either banging on NATH door or propping the building door open. I have an open harassment case against NATH boyfriend because he harassed me outside of the building. just last night NATH was changing the door lock and our landlord just said ""dont do that"" and left. NATH smokes inside and bylaws said it was a landlord problem. NATH shitty friends all have keys to the apartment and frequently bang on my door instead of hers. also, NATH boyfriend ripped a fire extinguisher off the wall and yelled at me to come out and fight him when I yelled through the door to please shut up I work in the morning. When I didnt come out, he threw it at the floor in the hall. You can still see a crack.
it's been months. I'm exhausted. I dont feel safe in my own fucking apartment. I cant afford to move. I need to live within walking distance of work.
what can I do? my landlord has said multiple times over the phone ""I'm evicting her this month"" but it never happens. I've been complaining for months. what do I do? can I go on a rent strike? I'm on a month to month lease at the end of this month
im scared. I'm tired. what can I do, if anything, to either get my landlord to evict her or for me to not pay to live here anymore so I can save to move somewhere better?

A 27-year-old man has been arrested following an arson fire and theft at a Walmart in Campbell River last week.

The theft occurred around 10 p.m. on October 1. A video circulating online shows a fire burning in the toilet paper aisle as smoke fills the store.

It was determined the fire was intentionally set as a diversion tactic to enable a very significant theft from the store.

Thousands of dollars worth of electronics, including phones and iPads, were stolen as the store was being evacuated.

RCMP are warning the public to avoid any ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù prices for electronics.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very buyer beware, as items that are stolen can be disabled by the manufacturer when they are brought online,‚Äù reads a statement released by RCMP on Friday.

The small blaze which ended up causing damage in the millions of dollars temporarily shuttered one of the largest retailers in Campbell River for the Thanksgiving long weekend, with no reopening date set at this time.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything we can to re-open the store‚Ä¶ We need to ensure the store is safe and up to the standards Campbell River customers expect,‚Äù a spokesperson for Walmart told the Campbell River RCMP in a statement.

The suspect from Campbell River is facing recommended charges of arson with a disregard for human life, theft over $5,000 and mischief over $5,000.

‚ÄúThis was and continues to be a group effort for our detachment,‚Äù said Inspector Jeff Preston. ‚ÄúThe professionalism and skill with which our officers have conducted this investigation has provided the opportunity to hold the correct person accountable.‚Äù

The maximum sentence for arson is life in prison, and the maximum sentence for theft and mischief is 10 years each.

There were no injuries caused by the fire.",VictoriaBC,"Campbell River Walmart fire was cover for large phone/ipad heist, RCMP say be careful of any really good online deals",0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/j8e8ro/campbell_river_walmart_fire_was_cover_for_large/

This post is just from my experience, but I do believe it may help educate people on the basics of a key issue that is rarely brought up in this debate, and something that infuriates me personally: **the lack of second and third stage housing in this city.**

¬†In reality, it is really hard for someone who has been chronically homeless, addicted, or both to rebuild their lives, but it *is* possible with compassion *and* accountability. Whether people love or hate our city's approach to our homeless community, everyone wants to know what a possible next step is. Easier said than done.

*Edit:* going forward when I say 'we' I mean our collective social institutions and government bodies not our individual citizens.

Next steps are recovery housing and services that are affordable (and when I say recovery I mean recovery from addiction *as well as* any associated traumas). When it comes to housing we need:

'Wet' buildings for people who just want to use drugs and only need the bare minimum to keep them safe (clean needles, and a roof. Plain Jane stuff).

'Dry' housing for people who actually want to kick the habit. Right now, probably 80% of housing for the homeless is 'wet'. And half of the 'dry' housing is really 'wet' because workers are either paid so little or worked so hard they don't care to enforce the rules. Anawim House (with a whopping 7 rooms) is one of the only good examples of second stage housing in the city, though there a few others. Anawim is a small not profit (in the true sense of the word) with only 7 rooms... That barely makes a dent in our homeless population.

Privatized rehab facilities are pretty much a scam and those that aren't cost thousands a month, far more than any homeless person can afford.¬†

The problem can be summarized as this: the city (and most north american cities) treat addiction using a misconstrued version of the harm reduction model. Our version seems to be to prioritize keeping addicts alive rather than pushing other services onto them. This is an okay method *if* the services are still there for any addicts who do want to kick the habit and *if* the services are easily accessible for when that addict actually does decide to make a lifestyle change. Unfortunately, here in VIC all we do is try our darndest to keep addicts alive and then pat ourselves on the back for being nice, I guess? Despite our kindness, we also throw our hands up when it comes to people who are severely mentally ill (that's another thing entirely).

As it is now, if an addict has an epiphany to try and get clean they go talk to a worker somewhere. That worker then recommends they go through detoxification and then perhaps into stabilization. Detox Victoria, usually the first step on the road to recovery, has only 21 beds.¬†

Let's say that addict gets out of detox or stabilization with roughly 14-50 days of sobriety. This is a great start! But then they go... where? Either into a wet building if they are lucky or back onto the street. Either way, this a pretty demoralizing environment in which to try and stay sober, let alone get counselling or find and keep a job etc. Inevitably they relapse and the cycle begins again.

Thus, we need more resources to help people rebuild their lives rather than just stay alive (but we need those too).

*Edit:* I've worked in the field for a solid number of years. I have literally had homeless people sob at my feet because they have fought desperately for a few months of sobriety, and are understandably terrified of leaving stabilization because they know it will be essentially impossible for them to keep up that positive momentum. Sometimes, it will be this persons ninth or tenth kick at the sober can. Of course, they can't just stay at stabilization forever either.

Most addicts are good people underneath their addiction. Even the worst addict has fleeting moments of humanity, and the real disservice our society does to them isn't that we get angry and wish they could be better, but that we make it so hard for them to get better.¬†For smokers out there, imagine being homeless and trying to quit smoking while everybody around you is lighting up.

To put all this simply:

The active user gets given a clean needle, a coffee, and a sleeping mat.

¬†The person 30 days sober gets a coffee, a sleeping mat right next to the active user, and is told, 'good luck'.¬†

- Is this an over reaction? No. It's a serious disease.

##Oh it's just a virus - you'll get flu-like symptoms!

- Symptoms are just side effects of how our body fights viruses. You can also get ""Flu-like"" symptoms from HIV.  

- We know this virus is NOT the flu. Aside from being a totally different BRAND NEW TO HUMANS virus, compared to the flu it spreads A LOT faster, and incubates longer.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES_v3sMUEAA4uKk?format=jpg&name=4096x4096. We are lucky that we have other corona viruses to look at for similarities, but nobody should want to be incubated with a brand new, unstudied virus.

##It's a low mortality rate

- We are learning that China didn't report the correct numbers as the death tole in Italy rises faster than the Chinese one did - shocker, I know. It's in Italy, where 99% have died with underlying medical conditions, just like our parents and grandparents. But maybe Norther Italy smokes more, eats more fats, and are generally unhealthy? Also no. They are us. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/

We've learned from the quarantined cruise ship that **1 in 5 carriers are totally asymptomatic throughout the whole process**. They will never know they are carrying the disease.

##The one I am hearing:  ""I'm old, it's my time to die, so be it.""

- FUCK YOU your virus riddled corpse is going to take up space in a hospital for somone else that can be saved. **Maybe you take care away from an infant, or that friend you had dinner with 5 days ago, to keep you alive longer**, because they don't have the same cavalier attitude you have about your own life.

However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently well over [a million](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO has classified it as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, [talking](https://www.newsweek.com/speaking-can-transmit-coronavirus-due-tiny-droplets-saliva-nih-study-suggests-1496719), and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic. [Here's another one](https://vimeo.com/402577241).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)‚Äîespecially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

* If you're still experiencing distress, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face

* After *every* outing, [wash your hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fmjbsk/washing_your_hands_is_more_effective_than_hand/) and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is *at least* 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Wear a mask in public when possible ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fmla3q/sarscov1_frequent_mask_use_in_public_venues/) | [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html))

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key. Wash your gloves often.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* [Take extra precautions when shopping for groceries, even when buying online.](https://www.consumerreports.org/food-shopping/how-to-protect-yourself-from-coronavirus-when-grocery-shopping/?EXTKEY=EE032IBAC&utm_source=acxiom)

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* **UPDATE:** March 20th: [Comorbidities in Italy published](https://www.covidgraph.com/p/coronavirus.html#comorbidities). 48.6% of deceased had 3+ comorbidities.

* **UPDATE:** March 22nd: [Study Calculates Just How Much Age, Medical Conditions Raise Odds Of Severe COVID-19](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/22/819846180/study-calculates-just-how-much-age-medical-conditions-raise-odds-of-severe-covid?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=health)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response measures taken, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to vulnerable others, but because experts don't know what the longterm side effects are. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

Take precautions, or [this can happen to you](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/the-story-of-a-coronavirus-infection.html?__twitter_impression=true).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. But to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal‚Äîthat and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), which will be kept up to date (as will any PSA I posted myself, as long as it's still on the main page of your sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

I‚Äôm new to Reddit. 

I felt I should share this to help others out and hopefully prevent the possibility of anyone else having to go through what me and my partner have experienced since moving to Victoria. Basically, since we‚Äôve moved here we‚Äôve had an absolutely nightmare of an experience with our landlord who lives upstairs, and are pretty positive she‚Äôs done this to the last tenants as well as who knows how many others. 

To give a bit of a backstory, me and my partner both decided to move for the purpose of going to school here and to be closer to family. We began messaging a bunch of places and posting ads on both Craigslist and Kijiji looking for a 1 Bdrm suite when I got a text from a woman who claimed she had a basement suite available in the Gorge and Tillicum area. After introducing ourselves and texting for a while, we set up a meeting with her and ended up commuting across island to meet her in person and see the place. Now, although she seemed a little paranoid, we assumed it was due to the fact she is retired and lived alone, and assumed she would (as normal people usually do) relax a little once she realized we were trustworthy tenants. We decided to go forward and sign a 6 month lease. Big mistake...

Pretty much immediately after moving in on the 27th of December she started bothering us and would text me non-stop to complain about trivial things such as how I was parked in the driveway, so I apologized and started parking closer to the right of the house (her issue was that it was difficult to get the recycling out to the curb or something). But it didn‚Äôt end there. She began constantly coming downstairs and knocking on our door as well to complain. In one case it was that she could hear a buzzing noise from our space heater, which upon discovering what it was through looking past me in the doorway bothered her. She said since other tenants had never complained about the heat, she would likely have to ‚Äúlet us go‚Äù for having it. At times it was obvious she would come downstairs just stand outside of our door for no reason and listen to us as well. We should have known by the way she talked about her previous tenants; she claimed they drank all the time and smoked cigarettes and weed inside, causing her health problems which led her to go to the doctor, and the doctor then said there was nothing they could do and told her to take Benadryl and kick out her tenants. We never smelled anything in the suite, but assumed she was telling the truth obviously and trusted her for some reason. 

Now we see that they were likely tortured the same way we have been. As soon as we realized that she was overstepping boundaries and not leaving us alone by constantly knocking on our door, and after threatening to kick us out for having a space heater, I contacted the RTB. I was instructed to ask her via text to leave us alone and if she continued, to block her number. I followed this advice and wrote to her asking her to leave us alone, and ended up having to block her number. She then began harassing us and claiming that we were drinking all the time and smoking inside, both absolutely false. Neither of us smoke or are ‚Äúdrinkers‚Äù. We‚Äôre hardly ever home because we‚Äôre at school.

This woman has gotten worse and worse with us. She now just periodically comes downstairs and yells at us saying we‚Äôre smoking while my partner is watching tv and I‚Äôm studying or vice versa. She‚Äôs an absolute nutcase. I‚Äôve filed a dispute, but the hearing isn‚Äôt until April. Directly after serving her papers, we received an eviction notice saying the EXACT same story she told us about her last tenants regarding smoking weed, cigarettes, the Benadryl, etc! So we‚Äôre fighting the notice until we find another place. In the meantime, I have PILES of evidence of her harassment. She literally leaves probably 2-3 notes on our door every other day, while yelling at us through our door during the evenings when she‚Äôs feeling bored. **I just don‚Äôt want anyone else to go through this. If an older ‚Äú1950s‚Äù woman from Fiji offers you a place, RUN. She‚Äôs a psycho!**

I would also like to add that if you‚Äôre reading this and you were previous tenants at this place, please contact me if you can! I would love to talk to you.

I think it was going to be a letter that ended up too long so I forgot to do anything with it, but it doesn't seem bad enough to just delete.

 

**I keep hearing about the hopes of the recent ‚Äòclimate strike‚Äô initiated primarily by the actions of our students.**

**The nature of the problem is unanimously agreed on ‚Äì the politicians aren‚Äôt doing enough to fix the real and urgent climate problems nor are they doing enough to stop money being wasted by those people on the other side whose view of the climate problems are wrong.** 

**It is the solution that is lacking. And the fact that the youth of today don‚Äôt even notice they lack the same thing, is on us, not on them. We are supposed to encourage our youth to march across the picket lines, holding a sign made from 100% recycled fair-trade paper, affixed to wood recycled from all the signs that litter the streets after each election, and work their asses off to fix the problem.** 

**But we've somehow taught them that a stop-work industrial action against planet Earth can accomplish the aim of saving planet Earth.**

**The reason the politicians aren‚Äôt able to fix the problems, is because they are elected leaders in a representative democracy, who are therefore unable to accomplish their constituent‚Äôs demands in an effective manner, as it is not in their constituents interests for them to do so, and consequently not in their interest to do so.** 

**Let me illustrate with a simple example: Adam, Bill and Charlie elect Dave to be their representative leader, who will do what needs doing. Then they tell Dave the environment needs fixing as number 1 priority. Dave applies political pressure, and finally gets funding to fix the environment of his riding shifted to his control.** 

**Edward oversaw the fixing of the environment in Dave‚Äôs riding, before Dave got the funding withdrawn for his environmental services company‚Äôs contract. This caused Edward to have to lay off Frank, the guy he had hired to work on it using 60% of the funding. 75% including the truck lease. As Frank leaves his truck keys on the table, Edward suggests Frank talk to Adam, Bill and Charlie to gain employment again. Frank does.**

**Adam is happy Dave is finally doing something about the environment, and regrets Frank‚Äôs employment was terminated. Adam drives a Volt, so he is already doing his part, but he assures Frank something will come up, and Dave will make effective use of the money to integrate the parts together to fix the environment.**

**Bill is a teacher, busy educating future leaders on how to effectively campaign for someone to fix the planet. He too is doing more than his fair share, with this burden. And on a teacher‚Äôs salary, he and the wife can barely pay the mortgage on their rental condo, not to mention their house. After mentioning he stopped using plastic bags for his shopping years before it was mandatory, he tells Frank that he knows Charlie from whom he bought the condo, is doing something big for the environment.**

**Charlie is indeed. Charlie is a developer, but one more concerned about the planet‚Äôs health than making money. As such, he has already set aside half the money Dave obtained for funding, to fund a campaign to raise awareness of the new Society that has been set up to provide environmental certification for proposed developments in the area, before they go to Dave for approval. Unfortunately Frank does not have the necessary degree in soil sciences or biology that would be required to consider him for the field position at the society, and as Charlie informs him, Charlie recused himself from any part in the Society beyond its initiation, and is not taking so much as a cent from it, to avoid a conflict of interest. But he encourages Frank to apply for the position anyway, as he seems like a capable guy who could maybe get past the credential check.**

**Frank does. He never gets a response to his email, so he emails to follow up, again. He never gets a response to his email, so he calls the number on the website. The lady who answers says they cannot divulge why he was not accepted for an interview, due to privacy reasons. Frank asks her to check that they got his application at least. She searches with suspiciously loud random sounding typing, and eventually says she found it. Frank asks when it was received. She says she cannot divulge that information due to privacy reasons. Frank hangs up the phone, before swearing at her for several minutes. Then the doorbell rings. It‚Äôs Bill, checking up as he hasn‚Äôt received Frank‚Äôs rent payment which was due today.**

**Frank spends the next few years measuring the efficiency of the new Society, and after eventually obtaining their financial records from a dumpster, puts all his information together into a report, proving how only 1% of the money Dave directed to fix the environment is used to directly benefit the environment. Frank emails this to the media. He never gets a response to his email, so he emails to follow up. Frank hates the stares people give him when he goes to Starbucks or the library to send emails and charge his phone, which he now uses to use to write his reports from his tent-office. But he knows things are about to change.**

**He never gets a reply to his follow up, so Frank goes to the media‚Äôs office. Frank asks at reception to speak to the person who receives emails sent to where he sent his email. After a long conversation, a security guard comes and asks if there is a problem. Frustrated, Frank asks the security guard why the media haven‚Äôt acted.** 

**After explaining his report, Frank receives a surprisingly eloquent response, including the security guard‚Äôs theory that the media only wants to print or air stories that show the system is working, as they have gradually become an integrated part of the system, instead of an entity that places itself outside the system. The security guard introduces himself. He is also Frank. Mollified somewhat that at least someone ‚Äògets it‚Äô, and happy at the coincidence of them** **having the same name as him, Frank wishes the security guard, ‚Äúhave a good day,‚Äù and leaves the offices.** 

**Frank begins to walk back to the semi-hidden path through the brambles to his tent, in the park he pitches his tent in. Frank likes this spot because he has been there over a month and the police have not yet arrived with a complaint to indicate he has been noticed by a local resident. Like that one lady who yelled at him and said he was ruining the environment by cutting a path through the foliage. But she called the cops when he started to explain to her what invasive species were and how, if anything, it was a good thing Frank had done. And when the police arrived, they confiscated his rusty pair of loppers while moving him on because they said there had been mention of him threatening someone with a pair of loppers while waving them in someone‚Äôs face. Frank isn‚Äôt completely sure but he thought they were by his side the whole time.**

**Frank remembers feeling sad. Those loppers were his last possession he still owned, from when he moved out of his rental condo a day before he would have been evicted. Even if they were not worth any money to a pawnbroker, and technically not his possession but the property of Edward‚Äôs company. Then, Frank sees a discarded newspaper, with Dave‚Äôs picture next to someone else‚Äôs. Frank learns that a guy named George has been elected, and has already begun the push to withdraw funding for Dave‚Äôs ‚ÄòDeveloper Society‚Äô as he calls it.** 

**George promises to bring true reform and finally fix the environment, the article states in a tone that is completely neutral and, Frank thinks, suspiciously careful to avoid comparing George‚Äôs promises with that of his predecessor.**

**Frank shares his conspiracy theory with a guy who stopped to throw a toonie in his hat, as he sat leaning against a brick wall reading the paper. The guy says he thinks Frank is reading too much into it, and mentions George drives the new model Volt that just came out. He adds that George has already switched the riding‚Äôs office coffee machines to dispense paper based stirrers, instead of plastic ones. ‚ÄúOn day 1‚Äù, he says as parting farewell, walking away.**

**By complete coincidence, the next day Frank learns that George also collects the recyclable beverage containers from the riding office, and donates them to the homeless to sell. Frank was able to afford a six-pack of beer and a pack of smokes after adding his morning haul and the toonie from yesterday. Frank admits, with a hint of regret, as he sips a beer, that George is a pretty good guy.**

**The next day, Frank seeks out a newspaper, and learns that a special interest group has published a damning report into George‚Äôs planned cutbacks based on evidence provided by a subcontractor.**  **Frank learns that Dave had tapped Edward to be the part time subcontractor at a very nice wage, to do the field work at the same job Frank had applied for. Frank already knows Edward had the same qualifications as Frank.**

**A few days later Frank sees a picture of Edward and George shaking hands on the cover of a newspaper in the stand. He takes several copies of the free daily newspaper, but does not read the article, as the picture did not generate any interest in Frank to do so. He discards the covers of the newspaper in the bin at his park, as he has learned colour ink seems to cause an itchy reaction when used as toilet paper.** 

**Frank was not as careful today as he usually is. He did not notice that there was a guy out walking his dog, who had consequently observed Frank discard his newspaper covers, and then enter into the blackberry thicket, looking very homeless as he did so.**

**A gust of wind blows the papers back out of the bin. Like the flapping of a butterfly‚Äôs wings, this act of God causing a homeless man to litter, motivates Henry - the man walking his dog - to do his own small part for the environment. He places a phone call from his cell phone, as the newspaper covers blow by him, kicking one away that tangles on his shoe. The call connects with his local police, at the central dispatch call-center that handles all the local police forces in the city.** 

**Incident number received and noted in his phone, Henry pauses to pick up some of his dog‚Äôs droppings in a plastic glove made with 100% biodegradable material. Henry gingerly unrolls the glove, places it and its contents in the bin, and walks back to his rental unit, smiling as he reflects on how he still has the spark of the environmental activist in himself, even if he doesn‚Äôt go on strike these days.**",VictoriaBC,Will the climate strike too?,0.1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/dq5tom/will_the_climate_strike_too/

I'm moving to Victoria as an international student at UVIC for the September semester. I've read and learned SO MUCH about life in Victoria on this sub and still have TONS of questions for you guys üòÖ

My situation:

 *PhD student with about ~1000$/month income from the university as an RA , will be looking for other streams of income as well.

*I've picked August 19th as a potential date to arrive in Victoria and start looking for a place, job, etc. Which gives me 2 weeks before the start of my studies.

* I'm a pretty social and active person and don't like to spend much time alone. Don't smoke and not a big fan of alcohol either. I need internet AT ALL TIMES, won't drive and don't mind long commutes (~1 hour each way). 

*Prefer to live close to nature and then work, which ideally would be at a Gym/Rehabilitation Center

Here are my questions:

* Is August 19th OK/ Too late? If so, when would be the absolute latest date with good renting potential?

* Can I survive with a monthly budget of ~1000$, for everything? (except my tuition)

*Any specific neighborhoods I should focus on?

* Will there be a flooding issue with basement suites when it's pouring rain? 

* Any other tips/recommendations?

Some good news on the housing front. Just today, city council reviewed the [staff report](https://pub-victoria.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=93037) and recommendations to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the Missing Middle Housing Initiative, which was triggered by the scheduled six month review. That review found that the policy was too restrictive and resulted in next to no new housing qualifying under the missing middle bylaw.

Staff recommended a number of improvements and suggestions which council supported. But wait, there‚Äôs more!

Jeremy Caradonna proposed several amendments which were roughly:

- Delegate parking variances for missing middle houses to staff (goal is to allow car-light/free missing middle housing)

- Reduce front yard setbacks for plexes from 6.1m to 4.0m (goal is to make it possible to build missing middle housing on more sizes of lots and to prioritize backyard/shared spaces that are useful over lawns in the front that nobody uses)

- Increase the maximum height allowed and require that the basement suites have a finished ceiling that is at least 1.1m above average grade (goal is to ensure basement suites are livable)

And Marianne Alto proposed an additional amendment

- Increase the maximum allowable site coverage of corner townhomes to 50%.

Mayor Marianne Alto and councilors Jeremy Caradonna, Susan Kim, Matt Dell, Krista Loughton, Dave Thompson, and Chris Coleman supported all amendments.

Councilors Stephen Hammond and Marg Gardiner made a lot of NIMBY statements and voted against several of the amendments. No surprises there!

All in all, very positive changes. Will it be enough to see some missing middle houses get built? We‚Äôll have to wait and see. There will be another review at the 18 month mark, so about a year from now. If I had to get out my crystal ball, I would predict that these changes are substantial enough to allow at least some houses and we won't get another report that says essentially none qualified. But that‚Äôs just my gut feeling, I really don‚Äôt know. And to be clear, this policy is NOT intended to be the solution to the housing crisis. It‚Äôs just one of many things the city can do to make things better.

Specifically what stood out to me in this article was what one of Colwood‚Äôs councilors, Cynthia Day, said about the decision to reject the apartment:


> ‚ÄúI would love to support a project like this that has less blasting and more land preserved, but I‚Äôm in a hard spot **because this plan is not sitting well with our community. It‚Äôs not my job to convince the public to accept this plan, that‚Äôs your job,‚Äù** Coun. Cynthia Day said.


If Colwood council was basing their decision on who showed up to their public hearing, then they were very likely biased to favor NIMBY viewpoints over those of the general public. 


How many people in Colwood do you think Cynthia heard from? How many of you reading this show up to public hearings? The problem is it‚Äôs mostly people who don't like developments near them who show up to hearings, and **every** infill development has at least some people who don't like it. So it‚Äôs problematic when councilors see the feedback from those people as representing the general public.


The Canada-British Columbia Expert Panel on the Future of Housing Supply and Affordability report ""[Opening doors: unlocking housing supply for affordability](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/121/2021/06/Opening-Doors_BC-Expert-Panel_Final-Report_Jun16.pdf)"" (published in 2021 in response to our housing crisis) identified this as a problem, saying: 


> ‚ÄúAn important aspect of governance is the land-use planning process, which offers citizens opportunities to provide input on new development based on both real and perceived impacts. We believe that democratic processes are important, but that **overreliance on public hearings to make land-use decisions tends to favor certain voices over others.** This can result in perceptions of majority opposition to new development, **especially when the citizens most motivated and available to participate in the process generally oppose the development plans.**‚Äù


> ‚ÄúThis opposition puts political pressure on the elected officials in charge of reviewing the proposals. **Its influence strengthens further as those who support or stand to benefit from new housing supply often do not attend public hearings to voice their views and priorities.** Such proceedings contribute to a land-use planning system that prevents new housing supply in two ways: first, by restricting or impeding growth as a consequence of lengthy, uncertain and costly processes; and second, by **allowing anti-development interests to apply disproportionate political pressure on decision makers.**‚Äù


The report also said, in the section titled ‚ÄúNIMBYism‚Äù, that:


> ‚Ä¶ there are invariably vocal groups of residents‚Äîparticularly neighbourhood associations‚Äîthat can make it politically difficult for local governments to implement such changes. It is important to note that opponents to development, including but not limited to neighbourhood associations, may not be representative of the broader population. For instance, research has found that in Vancouver and Toronto, members of neighbour associations are more likely to be white, older, more educated, homeowners, who have lived in their homes for longer and hold different policy priorities than the general population. **To make inroads toward fairer, more representative discussions on land use and the way our neighbourhoods evolve, it is therefore important to make sure that all voices and interests are able to shape how our cities grow.**


Councilors are supposed to lead, not just do whatever a small group of people who happen to show up to a particular hearing tell them to do. So, yes, **it is your job to convince the public and to LEAD,** Cynthia!


This is just one example of what‚Äôs happening in basically every city. 

I also remember not too long ago [Saanich council voted to send an apartment building to an (optional) public hearing ](https://www.timescolonist.com/local-news/six-storey-shelbourne-condo-complex-goes-to-public-hearing-after-neighbours-call-for-more-discussion-6634908). At that meeting, ‚Äúcouncil was swayed Monday night by the concerns of neighbours, who said the building proposed by Abstract Developments would be too large and out of character for the neighbourhood.‚Äù Saanich councilor Colin Plant justified his vote saying (in response to the NIMBY pressure at the meeting) ‚Äúit‚Äôs very clear tonight, **the public has an interest** in having a public hearing.‚Äù

That seems like a pretty biased view of what the ‚Äúpublic interest‚Äù is right now and it seems pretty out of touch with the housing crisis we are facing.

Closures are a major problem for a lot of people and businesses. [We can't afford to build an alternative route or add more lanes right now.](https://www.capitaldaily.ca/news/malahat-detour-rejected) When car speed increases, stopping time and damage on impact increases exponentially.

I shared my case here in June 2021 and was just in Ottawa last month fighting for change at a Justice Committee meeting. Things are finally moving. Here's where we are at.

I am hoping I can count on your support with the below petition. This is directly related to the work I was doing in¬†Ottawa¬†last month supporting a survivor‚Äôs right to say their name without legal consequences.

https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Sign/e-4192


This is an official petition with the Government of Canada and supported by MP Laurel Collins (Victoria). A private members bill is also being introduced by her in the next short while supporting the same.

Please support a survivor‚Äôs right to their name and story. Please help push for change in our system and help give survivors of sexual violence a choice in the application of the ban and simplify the process to remove the ban should one choose.¬†

Currently, prosecutors may request a publication ban to anonymize a victim-complainant under section 486.4 of the Criminal Code of Canada. However, prosecutors do not advise, inform, nor request consent of a victim-complainant if a ban is placed on their identity. The law does not require that the court or prosecutor inform a victim-complainant, at any time before, during or after the proceedings, that a ban is in force. Most are unaware a ban is in force nor advised of legal repercussions and penalties for breaching the ban when speaking publicly or privately about their experience, resulting in up to a $5,000 fine or up to 2 years in custody.


For perspective, the person convicted of assaulting me received 18 months house arrest and paid a $100 fine. My fine for simply saying my name would have been significantly worse than that. This needs to change.

This concerns the informed choice and consent for victims. The prohibition by the Courts prevent a victim-complainant from speaking of their experience which is paternalistic, and reinforces a sense of shame and the notion that anonymity is protection, rather than support and information. Moreover, it is also in conflict with section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the freedom of expression, thought, belief, expression.


Publication bans infer that the offender/accused is protected and serves to directly benefit as the restriction and limitation prevents the victim-complainant from communicating, publicly or privately, regarding the offence and harm experienced.

Edit: 

1. There is NO automatic ban. It is applied for by Crown and the judge has no discretionary power - meaning the ban is implemented immediately and the judge has to apply it.

The problem is the ban is put on our names the vast majority of the time without our knowledge or consent. We are never told there is a ban on our name, or what the ban means and where the limits are. This is not to say this happens at every single case - a very small handful of people are made aware of the ban - but it is applied for inconsistently and without much information.

I‚Äôm thinking of taking a trip to Seattle thanksgiving weekend.  I haven‚Äôt left the island since covid began.  I‚Äôm feeling a bit hesitant about returning to international travel and would feel reassured if I could hear about others‚Äô experiences with taking this trip. 

I‚Äôve tried to do some research regarding entering USA and returning to Canada, via water crossing, in regards to Covid protocol.

My understanding from what I could gather is that I need only proof of vaccination to enter the USA, and that I will need to download ArriveCan in order to return to Canada.  

Could someone who‚Äôs done this trip recently let me know if this is correct?  

Additional questions:

Will my small paper vaccine card be accepted as proof of vaccination? (It seems very non secure and non official, but I wasn‚Äôt given anything else to prove vaccination.) Or will my QR code that I used for proof of vaccination in Victoria work at the USA border?

I have received my first two shots, but no boosters, for the purposes of travel to the USA, is this considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated?‚Äù

Are there any restrictions in place in Seattle currently?  And if so is a Canadian QR code sufficient as vaccine proof?

I‚Äôve been a tenant my whole adult life thus far and know how generally challenging it is to find pet friendly housing**

I‚Äôm looking for advice from any fellow tenants or other knowledgeable people about Emotional Support Animals regarding questions such as if it‚Äôs possible to get an ESA certificate before actually getting the pet, and if you have experience looking for housing with an ESA.

A few things on my mind,

- Is it possible to get an ESA certificate before owning a pet? I don‚Äôt want to get into legal issues if landlord finds out I got the pet before the certificate is issued.

- I‚Äôm currently renting a basement suite from a private landlord. Would there be real legal issues/possibility of being kicked out if I managed to get an official ESA certificate before pet adoption? (A few sites I‚Äôm looking at claim it‚Äôs supposed to protect you from no pet clauses)

- How would you go about searching for future rentals? I‚Äôm aware the market is crazy and landlords have the ability to pick out of a huge list. Do you not mention the pet and then present the certificate after lease is signed?

My intention is not to be shady or jump through loopholes, but I feel it‚Äôs what many people in BC are resorting to.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression with motivation and energy still being a struggle even on meds. I also feel alone quite often as I‚Äôm currently no-contact with my family.

I‚Äôve grown up with cats/dogs all my life and have never owned my own pet due to landlord restrictions despite believing it would help my mental health immensely.

Thank you for any advice.

\- Phytotherapy ( ask clinical herbalist, which doesn't have a regulatory governing body in BC, and therefore doesn't require licensure to practice the art itself. This program is designed to give you the science of nutrition and application of herbs in a western phytochemical clinical application to western medical diseases)

\- Doula Training

\-Nutrition

You could be considering going to PRC for a variety of reasons such as wanting to get into the field as a clinical nutritionist, herbalist, or licensed acupuncturist. Amongst all the other schools of acupuncture on the west coast, it is the only one that offers dual diplomas in western herbal medicine and acupuncture. Here is a break down of the good which is probably attracting you here in the first place, and an overview of the so-so & the straight-up ugly parts of this school. Be sure to read the whole thing for holistic insight into this school and if it sounds like a fit.

&#x200B;

***The Good:***

Depending on where you live, this school **offers the most western medical science and additional professional and business development courses,** which you can enroll in or audit to supplement your learning if enrolled in the Acupuncture program.

\-It is ""**university-style"" enrollment**, meaning you can enroll in anything they offer and aren't restricted to only taking classes in your program.  Be **mindful to not stray from your course checklist too much**, because anything outside of it won't count towards your graduation! No one clarifies this for you when registering for classes. Stick to your program guide and take additional courses and workshops as they suit you and your extra-curricular budget, and don't delay your grad time!

\- **No minimum GPA requirement, only 2 references,** and paying the application fee. This can be good for those who might have had a bad semester at university or were less inspired in high school and can't get into more prestigious ( and highly expensive schools like Bastyr).

\- **Location**: it is located in beautiful downtown victoria right in market square which is close to many coffee shops, good to-go food places for the health-conscious ( like the bulletproof upgrade labs bar, and green cuisine).

\- **Same-day free acupuncture appointments** for students who are enrolled in a program course. Go and check with the front desk to see if there are any free spots in the clinic today or tomorrow, and you get to get scheduled for free. If you schedule your appointment, students only pay 10 dollars per session.

\- Student Activity Fund: You can submit a petition to get the student body to approve any funds you want to appropriate to coordinate student activities or initiatives.

non-gendered **washrooms-** LGBTQ-friendly campus with non-gendered washrooms, and some awesome, epic, and smart queer teachers.

***The So-So:*** You shouldn't let the good things about this college be the deciding factor, and you should always anticipate that some degree of stress will come with being a student.

*PLEASE keep this section and the Bad section in mind as you weigh your decision to go here or somewhere else vs other programs in BC \[such as pacific royal institute (oshio), Nelson school of Acupuncture, Kwantlen ( only BC public option), or Vancouver school of TCM, see below for a complete list of alternatives\]. These sections are for you, the consumer, to make an informed decision and gauge the level of financial and psychological barriers these two sections highlight which are systemic at this school.*

&#x200B;

**No student community programming offered by admin:**

Looking for a school with school-organized events to meet your peers? Unfortunately, student community events are practically non-existent. If you want to organize something on your own, via your resources and time ( which is a scarce commodity if you're full-time), you have had to lead. if you are introverted but are looking for meeting friends at school the only place to do this is in class. Otherwise, there is no student social programming.

**TRANSFER YOUR PRE-EXISTING CREDITS IN SEMESTER 1 ( they won't count them after sem 1):**

this is an example of their profiteering policies that tend to benefit from your confusion and the lack of clarity they provide at the outset of your journey. For example, I have a university & post-secondary education in which I could have transferred over to apply to the professional development requirements and save money. 

No one will tell you that there is a time-sensitive window in your 1st semester to transfer any credits you might be able to apply.  The second option if you didn't transfer them, is to get dean approval ( and you have to hope your program dean is nice and pleasant to work with), ask for an exemption under previous experience in which you make it up in another credit via electives, or challenge it via writing the final. In the later 3 options, you have to pay them money relatively near the cost it would be to just take the class.

In my assessment: It's a small reflection of their general policies, where they orients themselves to benefit off of the lack of direction they give you. It gets compounded by the poor organization such as doing the onboarding process all through email. There is a lot of fine print in those initial emails.  It would be better if they had a messaging center in their student portal to streamline it, instead of flooding you with a million + emails in the onboarding process and throughout your schooling.

**Acu Program requires ""fluff courses"" that drive up your student debt total** in the Acupuncture program, and I call them fluff because ***they aren't required to write the CTCMA exams***. This goes under the so-so column because depending on where you are starting in your journey this could be your best friend or your biggest headache. It'll be your best friend if you have no post-secondary experience before your enrollment and want some business and writing experience then it could be great for you. (FOR ACU STUDENTS) If you have under 2 years of post-secondary education, this school provides you with increased hours in order to write in Ontario after grad, since you don't have 2 years of post-secondary.)

**How the PRC DTCM program Compares to other schools:**

Since they add up to **33 credits of fluff courses** that stand between you and your end goal ask yourself, do you need professional writing, business development, or other extra research projects to feel confident? Then maybe it's worth the added price tag of an **extra 12,000-14,000 in tuition** it will cost you to complete your program at PRC. Most other schools only require 190 credits and 1100 or so clinic hours which make you eligible to write the DTCM. 

To graduate PRC you don't get a choice to opt out of these 33 credits of extra courses to obtain your diploma, and this can take a whole 2 extra semesters for you to graduate. Something to note.

**The quality of your teachers in your programs is inconsistent:**

Now depending on whether you've ever attended university before, you might not notice it, but there is a tendency to the quality and professional experience the schools teachers have. *People who have minimal teaching experience are* ***privately contracted as independent contractors.*** This means that the teacher they hire is basically running their course and creating their own material to cover the required topics. This ends up, in my experience, resulting in inconsistency in the quality of teachers. Some teachers don't get through all the material because they monologue into their irrelevant rants, some don't have any relevant field-related knowledge in TCM and you're left to bridge the gap. Some teachers, on the other hand, are fantastic and deliver quality presentations and information. Some teachers are very knowledgeable but don't give you any hand-outs or notes and it's pure lecture. One other sad factor is that ***despite some teachers being there for 5+ years, they are still independently contracted despite them technically being employees, and they don't get paid leave, benefits, or bargaining power for pay increases*** when the school raises tuition. It's a sad reflection of a greater problem in society of businesses skirting labor law, PRC is very guilty of this.

**Student mid-semester and end of semester evaluations:**

They provide the illusion that they care about your feedback. But they rarely listen to the meat of the issues and take little to no course in correcting the issues. They kinda just disappear into the void and there is no, ""This is what we heard from you"" breakdown reflection. It makes the so-so because it's nice that they make the gesture of seeming like they care, but if it's any critique of how they do business or missing clinic equipment it goes unacknowledged.

(Subjectively- depending on how privileged you are)

vvvvvvv

***The Ugly Side of PRC ( what you don't see in the green-washed marketing material)***

1. **A lot of Hidden fees and a Shady AF Administration that write shady Academic Policies:**

Need to reschedule a test? That'll be **100.00**

**Missed a clinic and need to make it up? It's 21.00** a clinic you missed even though you already paid for those clinic hours, and you have to do the work to coordinate a make-up clinic. No extenuating circumstances are granted.

Want to take a course at another school? You have to pay them practically the price it would cost to just take it at the school. **It's about 250-400 dollars** for you to take a course somewhere else if you can't get into enough courses at the school, or for whatever reason you need to take a course somewhere else

Need to drop a course after registration closes?

Most public schools give you a week's grace period into the start of the semester. Not here. Once registration is closed and you need to change a course BAM... 10% extra before 1st day of semesters, and up to 30% after that.

&#x200B;

2) **They Hiked tuition by 9% in one semester this year,** and nothing says they won't do it again. This happened despite a huge outcry from the student body pleading for a reduced and sunset implementation of this huge increase in tuition. Keep in mind, publically regulated schools are capped at 2% in one year to account for inflation, and these out of touch profiteer's hiked it by an extra 7% with absolutely no change in quality or improvement to much-needed supplies in the clinics and library resources. Meanwhile, school co-founder Todd Pam is just chillen in a faraway land in Costa Rica getting rich off of you accruing more student debt, and the president is happy to implement out of touch board decisions to enrich themselves despite getting poll results handed to them showing them the negative effects it was having. See the poll results below and comments from PRC students to see what common struggles have arisen. They chose to increase it anyway ""because the PTIB approved it"", aka we'll do what suits our pocketbooks best vs what is in your best interest.

Cost of courses changed as pictured below:

(left) September 2021   VS January 2022 ( right)

675   --------------------------> 735    ( 3 credit course/ or observation clinic)

375 ----------------------------> 412     (1.5 Credit clinic)

1,200 -------------------------> 1,400  ( 6 credit course)

So for full-time student loans requirements, you have to be enrolled in a minimum of 3,675 each semester, and if you play by their timeline and want to graduate within the marketed timeline you have to pay up to 6,100 dollars a semester.  For perspective, that's more expensive than if you went to the University of British Columbia.  My personal opinion is we need a public option for TCM schools.

&#x200B;

3) **An Administration of Gaslighters:**

See a problem at the school? Are you stressed, or struggling from hidden financial penalties? Did the administration not handle something professionally? Are you pointing out inefficiency, or where student life could be improved?

*You'll almost always hear this*

""Well you're the first person who has said anything, and you're the only one who has brought this up, so you must be the only one experiencing it. So it's just your problem.""... "" If you don't like it, go to another school"", OR worse ""you *are* the problem"". Their approach is to shoot the messenger.

It is the kind of response that I have repeatedly heard countless students share similar stories, and it makes the students to feel psychologically manipulated and unsupported when having to deal with the school's administration. It's a sit-down, shut up, don't say anything, know your place kinda vibe. It's very reminiscent of Jeff bezos vs Unionization efforts kinda vibes.

They don't give a shit about their student's well-being, and I really mean that. They care about scaling their business profits and giving you very very little grace or flexibility in return. The proof is in the pudding of student polling ( included below), where they ignored the information even after a small student collective organized to sit with the admin to represent the student's voices. Neo-liberal capitalism runs deep in this institution, in that their reply was ""then go to another school if you don't like it"".

4) **No Bus pass program, no student with disabilities services, no health benefits**; Do you want health coverage as a student? They don't provide it, and also no bus pass program so you better live close or drive if you want to be able to get to school efficiently. Victoria busses are pretty good, but this is a huge area where they could do the bare minimum to improve student life. Students with a disability and need accommodation? HA, this school will say it's your problem. See below point

**False advertising of Time to Graduate for DTCM & ACU:**

Can you afford 5,000+ of tuition each semester plus your living costs? Or better put, do you think you can manage 10+ courses and not burn out? Yeah, most people can't so this is why I'm highlighting this huge glaring reality check if you're looking at the Acu program here. If you can maintain a 20-25 credit course load ( yeah you read that right they require you to take a whopping 25 credits to count as a 100% course load) maybe you have a hope of getting out of there in the 6 semesters ( or the marketed 10 semesters for DTCM).

If you are just a humble student getting fiscal support from student aid bc, with the recent tuition increase at this school, it is really hard to afford rent, food, transportation, AND maintain a 25 credit course load to graduate and get on with your life ( We're talking 4,500-5,500 a semester).

I recommend researching another local school, Oshio as an option b for the more fiscally savvy folks looking to graduate with less debt and quicker. Oshio has a 115 credit graduate requirement and PRC is 133 credits to graduate ( roughly 18 credits/1 semester/ 4,500 difference)

5)I **If you are a student who struggles with a permanent physical or mental disability** ( such as ADD, ADHD, PTSD, Dyslexia) Get a walk-in or family doctor to fill out the [appendix 8 form on student aid BC](https://studentaidbc.ca/sites/all/files/form-library/appendix_8.pdf) and you will qualify for 5,000 extra in funding, reduced course load requirement down to 40% to qualify for full-time, and be able to ask for extra time and accommodations for your tests. You also can submit receipts for tutors or help-aids and student-aid will reimburse you for your cost.

6) **Clinic & Course inconsistency:**

You better hope they have enough teachers to offer the courses you need to maintain your graduation schedule. They have a course-by-semester sheet that is basically worthless because they never stick to it completely. If it says they'll offer it, don't count on it. Thats, why this is making the ugly list, because you're graduation time, is completely dependent on if the teacher is available and if there is student demand. They MIGHT run it if it is the only course you need and it's your last semester, despite being the only person needing it, but most likely they'll say you'll just have to wait. ***Clinics are a mad dash to get into*** if you aren't into the 90 + credit 1st or 2nd wave of registration. And the credits in the semester leading up to meeting the 90 credit threshold, don't count until your grade are calculated. These scenarios can set you back a semester if there aren't enough clinics.You won't be in first wave until your 4th or 6th semester. They often don't have enough teachers to offer the amount of clinics students really need.  It gets dog-eat-dog for courses and clinics midway in your program. Making it all the more likely you'll be delayed.

**Primarily WHITE , RICH, and ABLE-BODIED campus:** Now there are some lovely humans who grace the halls and the students are cool. However, there is little to no diversity at this school, for example there is terrible wheelchair accessibility at this school. You'll see women of color who work at the front, but only UP FRONT. The entire board and administration are white AF and very ***uninvolved in the school*** with little to no involvement in the student body. But they were all comfortable raising tuition  3x the provinically public regulated inflation adjustment without consult, only announcement during a summer break period.

Depending on who you are, and your relative status of economic & social privilege, you might not care, and feel quite comfortable here. There are after all friendly students who attend this school.. However if you're in the BIPOC you won't see yourself represented too much. For example you'll note that they don't even celebrate Chinese New Year at a TCM school, not even a sign.

**I hope you get a nice program dean:**

Each department has a different dean for the program. Some of them I've heard are quite collaborative and kind.  From experience, the dean of the acupuncture program currently is a little power-over-you for power over you sake. What do I mean by this? The dean tends to give you very unhelpful, kurt responses, and frankly is quite unprofessional at times. There tend to be mediocre answers given that leave you feeling unsupported, or shut down if you're advocating for a need like class availability needs, if your trying to negotiate missed clinics, or credit transfers after the first semester. Now in fairness, on occasion (unless there is a chance to slap an extra administrative fee in there), she can be helpful for students with things like course requirements, credit inquiries, externship inquiries, etc. But for the most part, most students get a cold shoulder / stand-offish/ ""look down my nose at you"" vibe from her. Other deans I have heard are very friendly, helpful, and are collaborative with students in the phytotherapy and nutritionist programs.

Victoria police impounded at least one vehicle over the weekend amid protests opposed to COVID-19 mandates outside the B.C. legislature.

Police have established ""controlled access points"" in the city's James Bay neighbourhood in an effort to prevent trucks and other large vehicles from blockading streets and creating excess noise around the legislature grounds.

The checkpoints remained in place Monday, restricting access to local vehicles and people with legitimate business in the neighbourhood, such as going to the park or the library.

On Saturday, the driver of a pickup truck was stopped by police at Cook Street and Dallas Road. The driver told police that he lives in James Bay and was going home, according to Victoria police.

However, it appears the driver tried to then gain access to the area around the legislature by cutting through the ""very wet, grassy ground of Beacon Hill Park,"" VicPD spokesperson Bowen Osoko told CFAX 1070 on Monday.

The driver had been issued a ""level one"" notice for his vehicle the previous week, Osoko said. A level one notice requires the immediate removal of a vehicle from the road until the vehicle is fixed in compliance with the Motor Vehicle Act and Regulations, according to provincial law.

The truck became stuck in the grass of Beacon Hill Park and had to be towed away.

The driver was handed $600 in fines, the truck was impounded and the licence plates were seized, VicPD said.

The move to limit access to James Bay and the B.C. legislature comes as organizers and supporters of the self-described ""Freedom Convoy"" that occupied downtown Ottawa for several weeks continue to promise a similar occupation in Victoria.

Victoria police described these tactics as having ""a significant and unlawful impact"" on residents and businesses in the James Bay neighbourhood.

Since then, I've had swollen knees, ankles, shortness of breath, dizziness, odd long bruising (6 inch bruise for 2.5 weeks after doing a blood test). I have also been having heart issues. Heart inflammation/pressure/pain/fluttering. 

Previously I was healthy and do not recall experiencing any of these symptoms other than shortness of breath/dizziness after playing sports.

My doctor gave me a referral to a cardiologist and an allergist. Unfortunately, the system here is what it is and it will likely take a year to see either. 

I do not feel comfortable taking the second dose until after I have been able to see specialists and see what is going on. 

Due to being single vaccinated, I am not allowed to travel to the USA by land or anywhere by air. 

I cannot see a doctor here and I am being prevented from leaving. I tried to board an air Canada flight to new delhi where I have an appointment at one of india's top hospitals. I was denied boarding Monday and once again today (Friday).

I cannot leave unless I have a signed medical exemption form. The same doc who gave me the referrals and who has seen me since I started to develop these issues refuses to sign the medical exemption form understanding that due to this I am unable to see a doc for an ""undetermined"" amount of time.   

My options are:

1. Wait 1 year to see specialist here and hope that my situation doesn't get worse.
2. End up in the emergency room
3. Wait until federal government/transport Canada removes restriction on unvaccinated/partially vaccinated travelers. The USA land border is currently not allowing unvaccinated/partially vaccinated travelers from traveling.
4. Get second dose of vaccine and hope that it doesn't wreck me.  I would feel more comfortable getting second dose after seeing specialists and figuring out what is happening.

I just wanted to put this out here so that I can hear out what others think about our situation at our workplace. Currently, I am really perplexed about our situation.

I work at a daycare in Victoria.

Very recently, around 8 of our coworkers got positive results on Covid-19 testing. Not on the same day but day after day. 

It didn't take long until all of us had to book for rapid testing kit as more and more weren't showing up due to positive test results and all of us were getting worried. (rn, all of us have to wait a few or more days to get the kit)

I've wrote a letter to the employer about our opinions that we'd like to see the place temporarily close for the safety of the children and everyone else around.

Only answers we are getting is that they encourage to show up to work saying that BCCDC has no restrictions set for daycare.

More importantly, according to BC policy, unvaccinated close contacts must self-quarantine, but parents are not informed as more and more staff got positive results.

**When 3 staffs got Covid, they informed the parents but after we had 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th staffs getting positive results, they are not informing the parents anymore and I just think this is pure bullshit.**

If you are able to work from home, you can continue to do so on a full-time basis where operationally feasible. Those who need to be in the workplace, are encouraged to minimize vehicle use where possible, especially in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island.

And if you are looking for a way to help those impacted by flooding, which includes some of our own colleagues, you can donate to the Canadian Red Cross through PECSF.

""Good afternoon. 
As you know, the damage caused by this week‚Äôs flooding continues to have a profound impact on many communities across B.C. Earlier this week, the government declared a provincial State of Emergency. Today, an emergency order has been issued implementing essential steps to support communities in managing the ongoing impact of this natural disaster in the days ahead. This includes restrictions on unnecessary travel to help manage the impact of temporary restrictions on the fuel supply. 

In response to this order, the BC Public Service will delay the implementation of telework agreements scheduled for this coming Monday. Employees who are able to work from home can continue to do so on a full-time basis where operationally feasible. Those employees who need to be in the workplace are encouraged to minimize vehicle use where possible, whether through carpooling or using public transit.

I will communicate any further changes closer to that date. Please note this change applies to the implementation of telework agreements only and does not change the timeline for the COVID-19 vaccination policy.

It seems like the city of Victoria is asking for ideas on what to do about affordability. I think most of us can agree that single-family only zoning is not really that productive. However, I think there's a height restriction in a lot of Victoria which should probably be removed.

Personally, I don't care about how many new condos are built. The number we should focus on is how many family starter homes are built. My definition of a starter home would be 3 bed 2 bathroom and 1500-2000 SF.

Any family looking for this has a hard time.

Let's take a look at a good example. This listing is from Calgary and is 3 Stories tall.

[https://www.rew.ca/properties/3640323/171-3437-42-street-northwest-calgary-ab?property\_click=map](https://www.rew.ca/properties/3640323/171-3437-42-street-northwest-calgary-ab?property_click=map)

I think if we were to rezone SFH and replace them with these, lots of people would be happy. This particular unit doesn't have a basement, but I have lived in townhomes like this one that had a basement and it was actually quite nice.

3 stories isn't THAT tall and being around them isn't too overbearing.

I also know there is lots of red tape around building anything anywhere. Perhaps the red tape could be reduced for family starter homes in order for developers to have an incentive to build this kind of unit.

I see places getting ripped up to build super small unlivable units. What's the point?

When it comes to supply please push for family-sized units. Nothing below 1500 SF.  


EDIT - Of course raising interest rates to pre-pandemic levels would be a better affordability option, but this post is just about types of homes.

#What is it?#
It's a collection of chat rooms specifically for BC folk who want a little more *social* in their social lives.

#How's it work?#
Click [the link](https://discord.gg/MThNZwN7gF), say hi, and start meeting new friends.  You can run Discord either in your browser or download and install the application to your computer / phone.  Completely free and pretty darn easy.

The server is divided into chat rooms based on locations (like #vancouver-area, #kamloops, etc) and topics of interest (like #videogames, #food-n-cooking, and #hockey, etc).  There's even the age-restricted #adults-only room for those who like that sort of thing.  :)  Drop into the rooms that interest you and meet others in your area with the same interests.  There's something for everyone, but in case there isn't, stop by the #suggestions room and propose a new topic!

#Why?  What's the point?#

Every week or so there's another post in one of the BC subreddits saying something like ""How do you make friends here?"" or ""Hi, I'm new, looking for friends!""  I've moved more than 15 times across three countries and this is a situation that I've been in many times myself.  Everywhere I went, to make friends I started looking for groups to join or, if there were no groups, I started them myself.  That that's what this is, a first step to bring people together around common interests to help people be social and maybe make a few new friends.

The protest has gone on for a year, the RCMP arrived the week of May 17, 2021 and is reportedly getting more violent. As of August 29, 2021 there have been over 800 arrests. Making it the second largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history behind the ""War of the Woods"" Clayoquot Protests of 1993 with 900 arrests. The provincial NDP went back on their promise to protect the old growth. Regardless, that promise would have only paused logging old growth for two years. Two parties for the federal government of Canada have promised putting money towards protecting old growth with an election coming September 20, 2021. The Liberals promise $50m and the New Democratic Party promises $500m. So Teal-Jones is racing against the clock to try and cut it all down before it is properly protected.

Fairy Creek is one of the last remaining places with old growth in BC, Canada. Every forest here has already been logged and replanted. This isn't anti-logging. BC is covered in 2nd and 3rd generation(+) forests that can be logged. This is about saving the last of the 800-2000 year old trees that we have left. Lest the natural wonder disappears from this world forever.

One positive that came out of the pandemic was the relaxed relationship between bylaw enforcement and alcohol ‚Äî off-sales became the norm and drinking in parks became more accepted.

But one UVic expert is saying it‚Äôs not all it‚Äôs cracked up to be.

This week, Vancouver launched its own alcohol in parks pilot project, and in light of that researchers at UVic‚Äôs Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR) reported that drinking in public is actually bad for public health in the long run.

Led by director Dr. Tim Naimi, the evidence-based, public-health-oriented report is a guide for municipalities as they consider allowing drinking in public outdoor spaces.

Below, Dr. Naimi shares his opinion on why or why not the above is a good idea:
Why isn‚Äôt it a good idea to allow drinking in public spaces like parks and beaches?

According to Dr. Naimi, the negative physiological health effects of alcohol, the second-hand effects of alcohol, like violence, and the taxation it puts on municipalities to monitor alcohol-consumption and waste, are the guiding factors in not allowing drinking in public.
How will allowing alcohol consumption in these kinds of public spaces help restaurants and pubs?

Because hospitality-based businesses including restaurants and pubs have taken such a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing drinking in public spaces could hurt them, according to Dr. Naimi.

He said that because people who want to drink outside their homes could now purchase the cheaper alcohol from liquor stores and just drink in municipal spaces instead of patronizing restaurants and pubs, it would further divert business away from those establishments.
Why is it important to provide this guidance on drinking in public municipal spaces now?

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a sense of urgency to make things better for people in response to the pandemic. I think allowing alcohol consumption in public spaces like parks, beaches and city plazas is a well-intentioned but misguided effort to do that,‚Äù said Dr. Naimi.

‚ÄúWe should remember the COVID-19 pandemic will hopefully be ending soon, and the decisions that we rush into now may become permanent fixtures in our social landscape‚Äîand will not necessarily change them for the better when it comes to community health outcomes.‚Äù
Suggestions

Overall, Dr. Naimi and the report suggests not to permit consuming alcohol in public, but if municipalities decide to go that route, they have recommendations:

    Governments engagement with citizens.
    Keep these initiatives temporary and/or seasonal rather than permanent.
    Keep drinking to restricted times of day and areas within the municipal property.
    Legal advice about their municipal liability.
    Municipalities should encourage people to purchase food and alcohol from nearby restaurants, pubs and food trucks.
    Increase budgets for extra costs incurred by governments such as for bylaw enforcement or trash pickup.",VictoriaBC,UVic expert weighs in on why drinking in parks and beaches in Victoria is a bad idea,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/okiwzt/uvic_expert_weighs_in_on_why_drinking_in_parks/

I know of GamesWorkshop downtown, but this isn't really a club, just a store you can have a few games in.  
What I am interested in finding is a group of people to play with and enjoy the hobby with.

\- Tapas! Tapas Bar, Chorizo and Co and Bodega are all doing some form of take out. Grab some spanish tapas and a nice bottle of red (can you tell I like an alcohol pairing) and head out somewhere to enjoy!

\- Rainy Day patio?  I sat outside at Vis a Vis in Oak Bay on a rainy day and it was actually really nice. it's fully covered and heated.  I believe Lure also has covered spots, does anyone have any great ideas for rainy day spots? I've confirmed that Lure restaurant has a fully covered balcony and umbrella for their patio spots. (Sadly, the bubbles have been closed due to recent restrictions but what a fantastic idea for the rainy days!) 

\- Haus Sausage Co is doing a pick-up dinner on Sunday April 25th.  It's 1 full rack back and 1 full rack side ribs + Haus bbq sauce. Sides will include a southwest salad, bacon fat cornbread, and brownies for dessert. $60. Message them on Instagram.

The Fairfield location is really neat and a short walk from Gonzales Bay. It's a great spot to cycle to on the weekend and then take the goods to the beach. They also do deliveries on Sundays, offering  whole beans, cookies (Although I don't seem them listed as a current option), and various merchandise.

[Picnic / Picnic Too](https://picniccoffee.com/menu) \- In-person ordering. I am not sure if they take phone orders. Unique and delicious food options. It looks like they might soon be branching into late night food/drinks according to their menu (maybe they already have).

[Chicken on the Run](https://www.chickenontherunvictoria.com/) \- Phone and online orders, or in-person. They have their own delivery, but they are also listed on one of the delivery apps. The best hot wings (not ultra hot though) I have had in the city I think. I do not typically like any breading, but it's so well done and not soggy or too rich. They also do Chinese food and fried chicken but I have never tried those.

**Thai**

[Baan Thai](https://baanthaivictoria.ca/) \- Phone orders and they have their own app with no fees. I believe they also offer their own in-house delivery (unsure of cost). Flexible menu for those with allergies, sensitivities, and preferences. They are also listed on the delivery apps.

**Vegetarian & Vegan**

[Green Cuisine](https://www.greencuisine.com/) \- Online ordering, phone, or in-person. Really excellent selection of homemade vegan and vegetarian food, including a wide range of desserts. They have a takeaway buffet option by weight that is mouthwatering (they fill the box for you). It is like Whole Foods (used to be). I have never tried delivery or online ordering, which could be harder to discern if you are not familiar with the items. They are listed on Tutti for delivery.

[Fern Cafe & Bakery](https://www.ferncafeandbakery.ca/) \- Food, coffee drinks and baked goods - all vegan. They have been window orders & takeout the whole pandemic. h/t u/AtomicChom

Has anyone tried takeout from Brasserie? How does it translate?

>[Brasserie L‚ÄôEcole](https://www.lecole.ca/) takeout travels super well and we‚Äôve been taking advantage of it most of the pandemic (and will continue to do so after): text them at (250) 217-3640. However, I believe they will be closing for the three weeks once they run out of food. Their website contact page is the most reliable for updates, followed by [Instagram](https://instagram.com/brasslecole). h/t u/VIGirl (they are now closed for three weeks)

Places I want to try but never have: Dosa Paragon, Burger Crush, Bold Butchery and Wind Cries Mary.

Share your suggestions!

Addendum: My own opinion is to avoid the big name delivery apps when possible, especially right now, because of how much of the sale they take. I'm not immune to using them during the pandemic, but I do try my best to pick-up or call places with their own delivery. But sometimes personal circumstances can make it unavoidable. If you can afford it and are going to use them, some of the big name delivery apps let you send direct tips/payments to the restaurant when ordering.

Addendum 2: The [Downtown Victoria Business Association is extending its free delivery program](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-business-association-extends-free-delivery-for-restaurants-as-b-c-shutters-indoor-dining-1.5370128):

>From March 31 until April 19, customers who use the Tutti delivery app will not have to pay a delivery fee. Meanwhile, the DVBA says it will be covering restaurants' usual 10 to 15 per cent service charge.

There is a subcategory in the Tutti app for the DVBA sponsored restaurants (I don't believe this program applies to all restaurants listed on Tutti). I know that Tutti experiences are mixed and lean towards unsatisfactory. So YMMV. Delivery times have been the most frequent complaint I have seen, but I would hope that they have scaled up to some degree and learned over time how to mitigate those issues. Anyone with more recent experience (it has been a few months since I used it last), feel free to share your thoughts.

**YMMV: I got a push notification from Tutti today with coupon code ORDERLOCAL for $10 off my next delivery order.**

Tutti Feedback:

>I have used Tutti three times in the last 6 weeks. No issues at all.

Addendum 3: If you are a service / front line worker, or family that does not have the budget for takeout, I will subsidize up to $200 total (up to $25 per order) and possibly re-up this again sometime next week if there is demand.

VICTORIA ‚Äì To address rising COVID-19 case counts, protect people and communities and help break the chain of COVID-19 transmission, the provincial health officer is amending the provincial public health orders effective midnight tonight, March 30, 2021.
‚ÄúCOVID-19 continues to create challenges for people and businesses throughout B.C., and we are grateful for the sacrifices people continue to make to keep one another safe,‚Äù said Premier John Horgan. ‚ÄúWe know that the idea of more restrictions is not welcome news, but we are asking people to rise to the challenge with the confidence that vaccines mean better days are ahead. We are not out of the woods yet, but the provincial health officer‚Äôs orders, combined with our vaccines, give us the tools we need to move out of this pandemic together.‚Äù

New and amended orders and guidelines are in effect through April 19, 2021, and include:

- For restaurants, bars and pubs, all food and liquor-serving premises must only provide take-out or delivery service. Dine-in service is prohibited, except for outdoor patios. People dining on patios should do so with their immediate household or core bubble.

- Indoor, adult group fitness activities of any kind are also paused. Gyms and fitness centres are restricted to individual or one-on-one activities only i.e. one-on-one personal training.
The previously announced class variance for limited indoor worship services has been suspended. Outdoor worship services under the current variance may continue.

- Travel continues to be limited to essential travel, work or medical reasons only. For those who have travelled outside their health region, if you or anyone in your family develops any signs of illness, you must stay home from work, school or daycare, and arrange to get tested immediately.

- Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort is closed through to April 19, 2021, to address and prevent community spread related to non-essential travel.

- All workers are strongly encouraged to work from home, where possible.

- Public health guidance for schools has also been amended to support and encourage students down to Grade 4 to wear masks while at school.

‚ÄúRising case levels, variants of concern, increased transmission and an increase in more severe cases are huge concerns,‚Äù said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. ‚ÄúB.C. public health officials are making the tough choices now to break the chain and protect our communities.‚Äù
Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.‚Äôs provincial health officer, said: ‚ÄúSocial connection is important, and so is keeping our loved ones and ourselves safe. We all have a choice ‚Äì to stay safe or put our loved ones, our friends and ourselves at risk, which is why non-essential activities need to be limited and need to be outside with the same small number of people. The sacrifices we make today will help all of us to get through this storm.‚Äù

Everyone will always have their strong opinions on life here Vs. the rest of BC. I'm a fresh slate because I've never been to the mainland save Vancouver airport! Also with travel restrictions and being sensible over Covid, I probably won't travel to the mainland until mid/late 2021.

&#x200B;

So, what's your opinion guys? The things that are important to me:

* Affordable housing (Eventually want a house with a garden for dogs and driveway/garage for working on cars. First time buyer.)
* Drifting scene (which there seems to be a racetrack... for now)
* Hiking/MTB trails
* Jobs in IT (Seems to be everywhere)

&#x200B;

The island seems a fairly good fit for this, especially if I move up the island a little for the lower prices. However, I've had contrasting opinions everywhere from ""The island is where dreams come to die"" to ""Best place in the world"". The ferry is obviously a pain in the ass and getting around on the island does seem to be slow going.

&#x200B;

I've been looking at Kamloops or Chilliwack as an alternative, the attraction being the lower house prices, lower cost of living and the ease of getting around.

Sometimes in Victoria, I see the CRD Integrated Road Safety Unit camping certain areas. What first come to mind is places like the kink in Hillside where it becomes Gorge, or at Tyee & Bay, where left turns are restricted at certain times. I notice this because I myself got a ticket, in the middle of lockdown 1, for turning left on Tyee, so I may be a little sensitive. But I see them sometimes enforcing these measures that have more to do with traffic flow than safety. 

But then you get a day like today. Bad road conditions, new drivers who have literally never experienced this, dark clouds above dark cars, puddles being splashed over medians and snow flying off of uncleared car roofs. I drove the length of the Pat Bay up and down and saw 2 cops, one in Sidney and one once I got to Hillside rd. 

On a day where there's so many safety measures to be enforced, where was the safety unit? I'd understand if they were mostly patrolling around the Island highway, but still. I saw SO MANY cars with no headlights on, some that didn't even have working DRLs. Cars with 3 inches of snow on the roof ready to blanket the unsuspecting (or frightenedly suspecting) windshield behind them. Cars going too fast for conditions (though reassuringly not as many of those). I saw cars where the headlights were covered in snow! 

So yeah maybe they were somewhere in town doing their titular work, and I was elsewhere, and maybe some of you can enlighten me.",VictoriaBC,Where are the CRD-IRSU?,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/khthv3/where_are_the_crdirsu/

They sell frozen turkeys for a reason folks. It was just as beautiful and magical and special as the one we would spend with whatever parent got the ‚Äúreal‚Äù day. 

So we decided to do it again this year. I know that these restrictions are eventually going to lift. And when they do we‚Äôre gonna pick a day, book it off work, and go all out.

-my employer is now telling people to wear their masks when they get up (which I was afraid he wouldn‚Äôt)
-we haven‚Äôt gotten a lot of big tables lately. Before the restrictions we would constantly get big parties and have to put them at two tables. Since the restrictions we haven‚Äôt had to do this.

We have a 14 day quarantine for travelers outside of Canada; however, with cases spiking across the country, why have we not implemented any type of non-essential interprovincial travel or quarantines?

My wife and I are thinking about taking a trip to Victoria (from Ontario) as a getaway. We are mostly going to be keeping to ourselves and explore your beautiful island. We have never been to Victoria before.

From what we have read, BC seems to be handling Covid better than the other provinces and the restrictions seem comparable to the GTA with social distancing and people limitations in places. But, of course, since we am not from the area, we am not sure how restrictive the community measures truly are...

we've read the other Reddit posts where people have asked which areas to visit while in Victoria and, while we think the indoor places will have limitations, the outdoor sight-seeing places still seem like they are possible to hit and see.

We would appreciate any insight on whether now is a good time to come over. Our flights and hotels may be non-refundable and we are looking to visit in two weeks time, do you see it likely that things get significantly worst such that everything closes down?

Current Orders in BC affecting Restaurants (hotels/tasting rooms/breweries may be exempt) can be found here:[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirus](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirus)

Highlights of Provincial Orders (subject to change)

* 6 person max at tables - household bubble only (no changing tables for larger groups, no congregating)
* Mask required inside when not eating or drinking (required when walking to restroom, etc)
* Reduced capacity
* 2 Metre distance between patrons unless separated by physical barriers
* Patrons must remain seated (unless using facilities)
* Musicians need physical barriers between them and guests (plexi usually)

ConsiderationProud02,,1598987310,,False,ikqn2c,False,True,t3_ikqn2c,14,False,/r/VictoriaBC/comments/ikqn2c/schools_reopening_substitute_teachers_ttocs/,25," Hey folks, 

With schools going back in one week, I wanted to get some general public feedback on the use of TTOC (teachers-teaching-on-call) or as you may know them, substitute teachers. If you are not aware, our current back to school plan involved students being placed in ‚Äúlearning groups‚Äù to limit their contacts. (60 for elem/middle, 120 for secondary). In learning groups, students and teachers do not have to wear masks, or really maintain a 2m distance from each other (my understanding is that distance is encouraged in learning groups as well, but realistically without smaller class sizes that just isn‚Äôt physically possible.) The logic behind this is that potential outbreaks could be limited and contact traced easily. 

Now to the issue of TTOCs. Right now I now myself and many other TTOCs are feeling extremely anxious and unsupported by the current plan. We have been told we should be wearing a mask while teaching since we do not belong to a specific ‚Äúlearning group‚Äù --- but really nothing else. No on-site training or anything. And while masks are helpful, when you are traveling every day between different schools and classrooms and inevitably having contact with students, especially in younger grades, I do not know how much reassurance that gives me. 

And the reality here is that it‚Äôs not only TTOCs who are at risk with this plan. It‚Äôs students and families as well. We know all to well that this virus can be transmitted easily, which is why when COVID first hit, health care workers were immediately restricted from working at multiple sites. If a TTOC tests positive, imagine how many contacts across different schools will have to be notified? 

I just don‚Äôt see how, as a TTOC, it is safe for us to be interacting with different ‚Äúlearning groups‚Äù in different schools each day? It seems like way too much exposure and a threat to safety. 

For some general numbers: 

* Our district has 27 schools. While we receive calls based on our teaching areas, TTOCs can be called to any of these locations. At times, I have even worked at 2 different schools in 1 day. 
* Many TTOCs work in more than 1 school district. This is necessary for many in order to have enough work/income. 
* A TTOC who works at 5 different schools in a week, which can and does happen often: (Elem/middle: 60 students per learning group x 5 = 300 contacts per week. Secondary: 120 x 5 = 600 contacts per week) 

At a time when provincial numbers are rising and we are being told to limit social interactions, with limited to no physical distancing in classrooms, with winter right on the horizon ... these numbers simply do not feel safe to me, and it worries me that so far our school district has no plan to address this. Some suggestions have been put forward such as ‚Äúcontracting‚Äù TTOCs to schools or limiting the number of schools TTOCs can work at, but figuring out an equitable solution is difficult and nothing has been put in place so far. 

So please let me know how you feel about this aspect of the school re-entry plan. I‚Äôm genuinely curious to hear people‚Äôs thoughts on this!

&#x200B;

Thank you for your recent email. 

You are one of hundreds of residents who have written to the mayor and councillors or to the Provincial government (copying us) expressing concerns about tent camps in Beacon Hill Park, Central Park, Centennial Square and the downtown, Cecelia Ravine, Pioneer Square Park, Summit Park, Topaz Park, or elsewhere.  You may have received a reply on behalf of the mayor and council, but since I do not support the policies adopted by the majority of council on this issue I am responding separately. 

Because of the volume of mail on this topic I must send a form letter, attempting to respond to the most frequent questions and comments we have received. I apologize for the letter being so long - we have heard many concerns and suggestions and I have tried to address as many as possible of these issues.

First, I do not agree that we should ever have permitted around-the-clock daytime or permanent camping to become established.  We have seen a number of such encampments in the City and the region and invariably they have inflicted severe negative impacts to residents and businesses in surrounding areas.  They have resulted in increased incidence of theft from yards, vehicles and businesses, confrontations with passers-by, noise at all hours, significant environmental damage requiring costly remediation, discarded garbage, and loss of the use of public space by the public. They have also resulted in danger to some of the residents of the encampments themselves, with violence among campers, fire hazards, and exploitation of young or otherwise vulnerable campers. I cannot understand why our mayor and council did not give more weight to these foreseeable consequences in making their decision to suspend our bylaws against daytime camping.  The courts have said that if adequate shelter space is unavailable we must permit sheltering in parks, but we are not required to allow this all day long.

&#x200B;

There are several reasons why allowing around-the-clock or permanent camping creates so many more problems than the nighttime-only sheltering that the courts require us to allow:

‚Ä¢       Daytime camping is much more attractive to those from out of town ‚Äì we know campers invariably arrive from elsewhere in response to the availability of free permanent camping in an attractive location.  This is doubly true when other supports such as free meals are available. 

‚Ä¢       Daytime camping allows bigger structures to be erected and more material to be concealed, including stolen items and possibly weapons.

‚Ä¢       These larger permanent structures allow concealment of individuals who may be youths or being sought by the police.

‚Ä¢       Around-the-clock camping requires more toilet facilities convenient to camps, or campers make do without them.

‚Ä¢       Daytime camping results in more environmental damage as campers create space and install tarps, cooking areas etc.resulting in more garbage.

‚Ä¢       Psychologically permanent camping seems to create a sense of ‚Äúownership‚Äù of space by campers - many residents have reported that campers have been hostile as they pass nearby or take photos.

&#x200B;

‚Ä¢       In brief, the BC court found in 2015 that ‚Äúit is unsafe for the homeless and other residents of the City to permit any sustained occupation of a particular space by the homeless‚Äù \[Abbotsford (City) v. Shantz, paragraph 274\].

&#x200B;

For these reasons I strongly believe the City should immediately reinstate the prohibition against daytime camping.  The reason that has been given for allowing daytime camping, ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù, is manifestly not being observed. 

I am under no illusions that the current out-of-control situation could be quickly remedied. For a period of time enforcement would be difficult and we would have larger gatherings of persons in public spaces around support facilities, but I suspect rather quickly many of the current campers would disperse. 

Where would they go?  There are almost as many answers as people:

‚Ä¢       Many should be in supportive housing or halfway houses

‚Ä¢       Some would go back to their home communities where they may well find support

‚Ä¢       Some are essentially tourists and would choose to visit other communities

‚Ä¢       A surprisingly large number of campers have homes, sometimes shelter rooms or publicly provided housing, or even permanent homes, that they would return to

‚Ä¢       Some may merely find camping more pleasant than working and would seek employment

‚Ä¢       Some appear to have camper vans or small recreational vehicles that they can simply drive to another location

‚Ä¢       When the courts resume regular operation some will be sentenced or remanded in custody

‚Ä¢       Some should possibly be in permanent residential institutions for the mentally ill

‚Ä¢       And some could temporarily be housed in ordinary motel rooms or apartments with minimal supports.

&#x200B;

I know that the current mayor and council have put great stress on the last-mentioned of these options.  They have advocated that the City of Victoria and higher level governments should continue to purchase or create new housing units sufficient to eventually house all of the people camping in our parks and that the problem will then be ended.  I think it has by now become apparent to almost everyone except the mayor and council that this course of action is not successful in the way it is now being carried out, and indeed many letters have pointed out the reasons why it has failed.

The practical problem with this approach is that the numbers of new campers attracted to Victoria‚Äôs hospitable location continues to exceed the new units coming on line.  The more fundamental problem is that much of the homelessness we observe is a symptom of an underlying mental health or addictions problem that cannot be easily addressed.  Where this is the case merely housing people without addressing their issues results in negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods and often chaotic conditions and disorder within the housing units themselves.  This applies to the insufficiently supported housing we have seen at some of the motels that have been repurposed and also at more permanent sites such as 844 Johnson and some of the housing run by non-profits

It is true that negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods are felt less around the motels and inadequately supervised housing units than they are at the tent camps, since noise is more muffled, fires are less likely, supervision is greater, and people returning ‚Äúhome‚Äù with stolen goods may be more noticeable, but many of the basic problems are similar.  And of course, motels tend to attract people from elsewhere in seemingly endless numbers.

&#x200B;

Some writers have suggested putting tent camps in areas that are not environmentally sensitive, such as gravel playing fields or asphalt parking surfaces.  This would address some of the issue of environmental damage but not the other impacts on surrounding areas.  Some writers have further suggested such camps should be fenced and access supervised and controlled.  It certainly seems to make some sense that if the courts require us to allow nighttime sheltering of only the homeless we should be allowed to confirm that campers are indeed homeless.  It also seems to make some sense that we should be able to restrict people from returning to the camp with objects such as furniture and additional bicycles.  However, I suspect we would not be legally permitted to supervise camps in this way.

&#x200B;

I do think that until sufficient numbers of truly supportive and properly supervised permanent housing, or other solutions appropriate to each individual, are available, the City should put some of the resources we have devoted to managing tent camps into temporary night time shelters that meet the requirements of the courts.  My reading of the 2015 court decision about camping in Abbotsford and the court‚Äôs reference to the Victoria camping case is that the exact nature of the shelters that would have to be provided in order to allow us to prohibit nighttime sheltering ‚Äúis yet to be determined‚Äù, and will have to be decided once there is a sufficient number of shelter spaces.  However, as a first step we should work toward meeting the court‚Äôs requirement for an adequate number of shelter spaces that are safe and acceptable so that we can make the case that we have ended the need to allow sheltering in our parks and public spaces and in the doorways of our businesses. 

&#x200B;

Most of those who have written to us are truly concerned about the plight of those who are homeless because of mental illness or addiction, and wonder where the homeless will go if not to our parks.  They are also troubled by the apparent unwillingness of governments to devote the resources needed to address their issues.  These issues are linked, in my view.  There is a benefit to dispersing the homeless to other communities, rather than concentrating in a few small areas such as the downtown East side of Vancouver or the City of Victoria, which is that they become far more visible to all citizens of the Province, including those that living in ridings that matter politically.  The central cities where ‚Äúhomelessness‚Äù has been most visible are politically irrelevant to Provincial governments, since they always vote for the same party in any close election.  As ‚Äúhomelessness‚Äù and the underlying issues of addiction and mental illness have become more visible as well as more harmful we are seeing higher levels of government more prepared to spend the money and make the policy changes needed to address them.

&#x200B;

It must be said that many emails I have seen express, sometimes with great passion, vigour or despair,  frustration at what the writer sees as a council of perhaps well-meaning people, many living outside the City and immune from the impacts and costs of the policies they have adopted, who are apparently oblivious to the expressed views of voters who now regret voting them into power.  I do not know whether the mayor and council are indeed acting contrary to the wishes of the majority of residents (naturally we tend to hear mostly from Victorians do not support current policies), but certainly the perception that the council is far out of step with the voters is not conducive to public confidence and useful debate. This is one area where the Provincial government does have a responsibility, simply because the best way to ensure that citizens have confidence in their council is to have more frequent elections.  The four year long council term the Province adopted a few years ago to some degree allows councillors to ignore the voices of citizens, confident that voters will forget the reasons for their indignation by election time.  The four year term is appropriate for elections under the party system, where voters have a good idea what each party represents, but not for a municipal system where councillors may embark on courses of action that are entirely unexpected by those who may have supported them.

&#x200B;

Once again, thanks for taking the time to write.  I am always happy to hear the views of Victoria residents though I cannot respond to every letter.

I am new to town and wanted to understand the rental market a bit better. I found any estimates in the news or online dated and not useful.

So, I analyzed the first 300 rental adds on craigslist that fit the following criteria,

\- Allowed long term rental

\- Had photos of units posted

\- Were located east of Langford and south of central Saanich.

\- Didn't look like scams.

&#x200B;

I assigned each unit a quality rank based off of the photos and details as follows:

1. The unit appears top of the line, clean, modern, or new building (or heritage suite very well cared for. 
2. The unit appears clean and has been renovated to have modern finishings or flooring.
3. The unit appears clean but has dated finishings, might be a basement suite.
4. The unit appears dirty or in need of immediate repair, may have a restriction on the number of tenants, or many be dark/damp.
5. The unit looks like garbage. Add is poorly written or demanding and overly biased.

I also wanted to assess the minimum income you would need to be able to afford each type of unit. The required household income values would put your rent at one-third of your take-home income. This table also includes average square feet,

Another fun piece of info I pulled from my data, the average price of a two-bedroom rental downtown is $2352 - while anywhere else in Victoria is $1863. The average price of a one-bedroom downtown is $1830, while anywhere else in Victoria is $1472.

Physical Distancing at Beacon Hill Park and Dallas Road

April 9, 2020

The City is making it easier for people to maintain physical distance in Beacon Hill Park and along Dallas Road by restricting vehicle access and realigning parking.

Starting Friday, April 10, primary roads within Beacon Hill Park will only be accessible to service and first responder vehicles on weekends.

Parking along Douglas Street and on Nursery Road will remain open with an increased number of accessible stalls.

Along Dallas Road, parking near the multi-use pathway construction between Dock Street and Lewis Street will be suspended over the holiday weekend (April 10 - 13) as changes to allow parallel parking are completed. These interventions will free up space inside Beacon Hill Park and in constricted areas along Dallas Road so local residents can stay active, while also maintaining physical distance.",VictoriaBC,"Changes to rules for vehicle access to Beacon Hill, parking along Dallas",0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/fxz0wc/changes_to_rules_for_vehicle_access_to_beacon/

FEBRUARY 22, 2020 06:00 AM

Victoria‚Äôs cruise ship terminal at Ogden Point will be a little busier this spring as a result of cruise lines changing scheduled sailings to China and around Asia.
Fear of a spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, has pushed many cruise lines to change their schedules.
Celebrity Cruises will now have four extra stops in Victoria.
The Celebrity Millennium has added the calls at Victoria in April and May, said Greater Victoria Harbour Authority chief executive Ian Robertson. ‚ÄúThey have been added as a result of ships leaving the Asia market and coming to the West Coast earlier than usual,‚Äù he said.
Industry insider website Cruisecritic.com said Celebrity has cancelled the rest of its 2020 season in Asia and instead will offer a series of three-, four- and five-night Pacific coast sailings.
The site said all passengers booked on Celebrity Millennium Asia cruises will receive a refund, plus a 25 per cent future cruise credit, and refunds of any excursions and onboard packages.
Robertson said the GVHA doesn‚Äôt expect to see any cancellations in Victoria as a result of the virus, but they are monitoring the situation closely and will be taking direction from the Cruise Lines International Association.
The CLIA‚Äôs member cruise lines have implemented precautions by cancelling sailings, rerouting others, restricting passenger and crew boarding, and boosting screening procedures for passengers boarding from Chinese ports or who have travelled in or through China, Hong Kong and Macau.
The cruise lines will be denying boarding to all persons who have travelled from, visited or transited via airports in China within 14 days before embarkation.
They will also deny boarding to those who, within 14 days before embarkation, have had close contact with, or helped care for, anyone suspected or diagnosed as having coronavirus, or who is currently subject to health monitoring for possible exposure to novel coronavirus.
Clipper Navigation has also added a minor screening tool, as a result of consultation with U.S. Customs.
According to the passenger ferry, which operates between Victoria and Seattle, customs will ask passengers if they have been to mainland China in the past 14 days.
If they answer yes and are not a U.S. citizen, they will be denied entry to the U.S.
If they answer yes and are U.S. citizens they will be permitted to enter the country, but the Center for Disease Control will be contacted. That organization may then have follow up questions or procedures.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman told the Times Colonist the additional health screening was initially put in place at five U.S. airports ‚Äî John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, San Francisco International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago-O‚ÄôHare International Airport and Atlanta International Airport, but that has since been expanded to eight additional locations including Seattle.
U.S. Customs officers have also been told to be alert for those who might have come from an infected region.
Canada Border Services Agency says it is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into Canada.
Geoff Dickson, chief executive of Victoria International Airport, said they are also monitoring the situation and so far there has been no direction from the Public Health Agency of Canada or Canada Border Services Agency to change any procedures.
‚ÄúOur understanding is that enhanced messaging and screening measures have been implemented at the three Canadian airports with direct flights from China ‚Äî Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver,‚Äù he said. https://www.timescolonist.com/business/cruise-line-adds-victoria-stops-exits-asia-over-coronavirus-fears-1.24081854",VictoriaBC,"More ships for us!

We asked the strata president if this is okay cause we are unsure if it is considered a business. 

Their reply was ""answer:


Under Residential Tenancy Act it is considered a business.¬† I expect Strata Bylaw is the same.¬† So not allowed.


The reason behind it is the extra, transient traffic that cannot be held responsible for their actions.""

Iv done a bit of research in residential tenancy act and our strata bylaws and all i can find is as follows:

"" owners, tenants and occupants shall use their strata lot as a single family residence only. In addition, owners, tenants and occupants shall not conduct any business or commercial activity from their strata lot which results in members of the public attending at their residence.""

Rental restriction bylaw
""Pursuant to section 141(2) of the strata property act, no owner shall rent or lease their strata lot.""

I guess I'm a little disappointed because I want to rent only a room maybe 4 times a month. Not the entire lot. Which I think the documents refer renting as. Is airbnb a business? I dont need a business licence and members of the public wouldnt be attending. They are members of airbnb and screened before accepted. 


What is the legal definition of business and renting? Would that make a difference. Are foreign exchange students allowed?

Just looking for clarification if I have no hope of renting a room through airbnb or what the best course of action I should take to get the strata to see what I'm doing is alright.

‚ÄúSome people have expressed discomfort with our opening up the driveways,‚Äù said Mike Miller, owner of Abstract Developments Inc. ‚ÄúWe feel that is a minority, not the majority.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have had quite a lot of support from some neighbours that have reached out to us,‚Äù Miller said.

Last week, Abstract workers surprised residents and municipal officials when they showed up at a Miller-owned property to widen driveway openings in a 122-yearold rock wall fronting the lot, which spans 1.7 acres between Prospect Place and York Place.

A small crowd gathered, police were called and municipal officials hurriedly applied a stopwork order. Abstract countered that the order was invalid and the jackhammering continued.

Three hours later, Oak Bay imposed a 60-day temporary protection order, which Abstract agreed to obey. By then, the jackhammering was done, taking out 13 per cent of the wall‚Äôs Prospect Place and York Place frontages.

Later, Abstract said it removed portons of the wall because it feared that an expected move by Oak Bay council to enact a new heritage bylaw would restrict its ability to get the building completed. That bylaw has not been enacted.

The wall once bordered the home of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, a member of Parliament, cabinet minister and son of Father of Confederation Sir Charles Tupper. It is listed on Oak Bay‚Äôs heritage registry, but is not legally protected.

The lot and its wall have been controversial since Miller purchased the property in June 2016. Back then, it was vacant and overgrown, with one disused building, that has since been relocated.

Miller said he wanted to build a home for his family, and create four lots on the property as possible home sites for his children. But neighbours opposed the plan.

Plans subsequently shifted to an eight-home subdivision that would preserve the wall. But though it had community input, that plan won support only among those living on the Prospect Place side, not on York Place. Also, the plan did not accommodate a home for the Miller family.

After that, Miller indicated he was bringing back the original plan for a single-family home, for which he has already received municipal approval.

But the latest move to jackhammer openings in the wall in the face of stop-work order, valid or not, has angered nearby residents and the municipality.

Angus Matthews, one of the three neighbours who helped come up with the eight-home subdivision plan, said he regards the jackhammer action as ‚Äúpetulant‚Äù and ‚Äúimpulsive,‚Äù and a blatant ‚Äúabuse of public trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was just ‚Äòstick it in your eye, Oak Bay, and stick in your eye, neighbours,‚Äô ‚Äù said Matthews.

Miller said he regrets that some people in Oak Bay are feeling betrayed or hurt.

But he insisted much of the anger directed at him or Abstract is misplaced. ‚ÄúWe have kind of been branded as somebody who doesn‚Äôt care about heritage and that‚Äôs not at all the case,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf we didn‚Äôt value those walls, we would have knocked them down three years ago.‚Äù

Miller said he understands that Oak Bay is a community that is passionate about heritage.

‚ÄúWe share a lot of those same views even if we don‚Äôt share all the same views.‚Äù",VictoriaBC,"Despite wall of worry, developer pushing ahead with family home - Times-Colonist, October 24",0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/dmra2c/despite_wall_of_worry_developer_pushing_ahead/

https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/no-plate-no-insurance-electric-scooter-rider-s-ticket-tossed-because-icbc-offers-no-policy-1.23950695

Article text:

When police stopped Evan Laine while he was riding his electric scooter on Finlayson Street to hand him a $600 ticket, the officer was unmoved by pleas to let it go with a warning.

Laine had only just bought the machine and hadn‚Äôt installed the pedals. As far as the officer was concerned, the absence of pedals meant the machine was a motor scooter and required a licence plate and insurance.

‚ÄúWhen I bought the scooter, the pedals were under the seat and not installed on the bike,‚Äù Laine said. ‚ÄúI asked him if he could just let it go with a warning.‚Äù

‚Äú ‚ÄòAbsolutely not,‚Äô ‚Äù was the answer.

Laine took the ticket to court and it was tossed out. In July, a provincial court judge ruled he couldn‚Äôt uphold a penalty for not having insurance when ICBC offers no such insurance for a machine like Laine‚Äôs.

Laine had ridden his electric scooter into a tricky, sometimes confusing, area of rules governing battery-powered electric vehicles showing up on Victoria streets.

In his case, the problem arose over the question: ‚ÄúJust when does an electric-motor-assisted cycle become a limited-speed motorcycle?‚Äù

His electric scooter is classified as ‚Äúmotor-assisted cycle‚Äù and is allowed on the road, according to B.C. regulations.

The rules state the motor must be electric, have no more power than 500 watts and be capable of going no faster than 32 km/h without pedalling. Anyone 16 or older wearing a bicycle helmet can ride one and neither licence plates nor insurance are needed.

Rules also state the motor must disengage when the rider stops pedalling or releases the accelerator or applies the brake.

The ‚Äústops pedalling‚Äù provision becomes confusing when it‚Äôs paired with others that say ‚Äúit is not necessary to always be pedalling.‚Äù

Even the 32 km/h limit without pedalling is confusing. Why specify the machine goes only so fast ‚Äúwithout pedalling‚Äù if the motor must disengage the moment pedalling stops?

Also, as in Laine‚Äôs case, some motor-assisted cycles look like motor scooters, those zippy little machines usually built with a big cowling on the front. Motor scooters are classified as ‚Äúlimited-speed motorcycles‚Äù and they are a different breed. Their motors are restricted to no more than 50 cc for gasoline or 1.5 kW for electric, and a top speed of 70 km/h. Limited-speed motorcycles require a driver‚Äôs licence of any class, registration, plates and insurance.

But motor-assisted cycles, whether they look like a motor scooter or not, are different. There must be no gas engines. The motor must be electric. It must be capable of being propelled with muscles using pedals. It must, however, be incapable of motoring off from a dead stop, hence the pedals.

Another rule stipulates the machine must be at a speed of at least three km/h before its motor engages.

It‚Äôs not just electric bicycles and electric scooters that are appearing on B.C. streets. Other electric vehicles have appeared and been chased away by government regulations. Already banned on roads and sidewalks are electric push scooters, electric skateboards and self-balancing boards or hoverboards, according to the Insurance Corp. of B.C.

The B.C. government is examining new transportation technologies. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Transportation said government initiatives such as Clean B.C. and Move Commute Connect will consider how best to update regulations to deal with new transport technologies.

‚ÄúThe province is currently evaluating the legislative, regulatory and policy frameworks to ensure they help support and acknowledge all road users and emerging active transportation modes,‚Äù said a ministry statement.

The Capital Regional District is also dealing with electric transport, such as motor-assisted cycles.

Jeff Leahy, senior manager of CRD Parks, said electric motor-assisted cycles are allowed on the trails such as the Galloping Goose.

But park workers might stop them to make sure they conform to the rules, usually by making sure they have working pedals.

Some trails in some wilderness parks, depending on their management plans, allow back-country, motor-assisted cycles.

Motor-assisted cycles have become popular in mountain-bike circles.

Leahy said riders are expected to show caution and courtesy.

‚ÄúWe have multiple-use trails where cyclists should be encouraged to slow down,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe have multiple users out there like children, walkers, hikers, dogs, etc.‚Äù

Kelly Goldbeck, owner of KGeez Cycle, has been in business for years selling electric cycles and scooters.

Goldbeck said he has heard major manufacturers, such as Yamaha, are gearing up to release new electric scooters that will compete in speed with the gas-powered motor scooters now licensed for B.C. roads. He plans to sell them.

He said public concerns over carbon emissions and other pollutants will ensure electric bicycles, electric scooters and other forms of electric transport become more common.

‚ÄúElectric is not going to go away,‚Äù said Goldbeck. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on the upsurge big time.‚Äù",VictoriaBC,"Looks like electric scooters and skateboards are now de facto street legal in BC.

I live in a modest, older bungalow which matches my income and lifestyle.

After 33 years, my house assessment has dropped by half, but my lot assessment has leaped from $55,000 to $1.2 million even though the lot has not changed. In other words, almost all of the property tax I struggle to pay is due to speculative inflation.

Luckily I, like many of the current flood of retiring baby boomers, qualify for Property Tax Deferment.

Property tax deferment is available to B.C. homeowners who are 55 years or older, a surviving spouse, or eligible persons with disabilities and for homeowners who financially support a dependent child.

When you defer annual property taxes, the province charges interest on the tax deferment loan. The loan rate is 1.2 per cent for the regular program and 3.2 per cent for the families with children.

Deferred taxes and interest are paid when the home is sold or transferred.

PTD has kept me out of the clutches of the reverse-mortgage loan sharks.

Unfortunately the PTD is just a Band-Aid solution rather than part of any cure to the underlying problems.

In California, Proposition 13 has made a difference.

A big component to Proposition 13 was the idea that older Californians should not be priced out of their homes through high taxes.

Enacted in 1978, it decreased property taxes by assessing values at their 1976 value and restricted annual increases of assessed value of property to an inflation factor, not to be more than two per cent per year. It also prohibited reassessment of a new base year value, except if ownership changed or there had been new construction.

There is a built-in fairness to this cure. Why should residents who have paid taxes for 30 or 40 years to keep a town desirable, pay as much current tax as new owners wanting to take advantage of that desirability?

Come on B.C., enough already with Band-Aids such as PTD and secondary suites.We need a permanent cure.

My dad is a 65 year old retired two times cancer survivor who has had his face completely changed due to invasive surgeries. He lacks a nose, his face is misshapen, sunk in, children stare at him in the stores, and has no upper teeth (dentures once, but it didn‚Äôt work long term).

He rides his motorcycle and he‚Äôs thinking of giving it up because he‚Äôs tired of riding alone. I‚Äôve suggested the Lower Island Riding Club but he hasn‚Äôt had any success through it. He‚Äôs tried local meet up groups but due to his limited and restricted diet, they always want to do a lunch or something and he just can‚Äôt do it.

It really breaks my heart to see him so lonely, and I feel like my mother and I have done everything we can to try and get him out and about.

Patrol officers were called to the intersection of Cook and Pandora Streets at 6:17 p.m. for a report of a collision between a motorcycle and a vehicle. When officers arrived they discovered the motorcyclist suffering from non-life-threatening injuries. The motorcyclist was transported to hospital by BC Emergency Health Service paramedics.

Further investigation revealed the motorcyclist was driving contrary to his restrictions as a newly-licensed motorcyclist by not having a supervisor with him.

18-22814 | Impaired Driver Hit and Run

Patrol officers were called to the 900-block of Mason Street for a report of a hit and run just after 6:45 p.m. A citizen called 911 to report that a driver had struck a parked vehicle, exited his vehicle and then walked away from the scene while showing clear signs of impairment.

Patrol officers located the driver of the vehicle nearby and took him into custody. He was issued a 90-day Immediate Roadside Prohibition and tickets for several motor vehicle infractions. His vehicle was towed. No one was injured.

18-22815 | Cyclist Collision Sends One To Hospital With Non-Life-Threatening Injuries

Six minutes later, at 6:51 p.m. Traffic officers were called to intersection of Scott and Haultain streets for a report of a collision between a vehicle and a cyclist. The cyclist was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries by BC Emergency Health Service paramedics when officers arrived. In speaking with the cyclist and the driver of the vehicle, officers learned that the vehicle had proceeded through the stop sign despite the cyclist having the right of way. The driver of the vehicle also indicated to one of the officers that his vehicle appeared to have a malfunction with the brakes. His vehicle was towed as a result of the non-functioning brakes and he was issued a ticket for failure to yield the right of way.

""Island Health‚Äôs ban on edible cannabis products is arbitrary and unconstitutional, says the lawyer representing several marijuana dispensaries on Vancouver Island.

Island Health orders pot shops to stop selling edible cannabis products
Kirk Tousaw, who has represented several clients in marijuana access cases, wrote a letter objecting to the ban, addressed to Dr. Richard Stanwick, Island Health‚Äôs chief medical health officer.

‚ÄúThe patients that access edibles from dispensaries need that access for their health and quality of life,‚Äù Tousaw wrote.

‚ÄúDispensaries need to trust that Island Health is committed to working progressively toward appropriate and fact-based access to cannabis edibles, not to be threatened with possible business licensing sanctions by Island Health.‚Äù

In March, Island Health sent a letter to dispensaries ordering them to stop selling cannabis edibles because they violate the B.C. Food Premises Regulation, which requires all ingredients to be obtained from a source approved by the federal government.

Tousaw said the use of edibles has been federally approved under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes regulation.

Two recent court cases have enshrined people‚Äôs right to access cannabis derivatives and products other than dried cannabis.

Owen Smith, former head baker for the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club, was arrested in 2009 and charged with possession of THC for the purpose of trafficking after police found pot cookies and other cannabis-infused foodstuffs on the premises.

Tousaw, who represented Smith, fought the charges all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled in 2015 that restricting patient access to only dried cannabis is arbitrary and unconstitutional.

Stanwick could not be reached for comment, but told the Times Colonist after news of the ban that dispensaries are not receiving their edibles products from federally approved sources. Medical marijuana producers licensed by Health Canada, such as Tilray in Nanaimo, send their products directly to patients through the mail.

‚ÄúThe difficulty is that we do have a producer of marijuana, in fact a number of them, that the federal government [has] sanctioned,‚Äù Stanwick said.

‚ÄúBut that is only for people who receive their medical marijuana prescriptions from them. And they are not allowed to sell their product to these bakeries and to these dispensaries for use in edibles.‚Äù

Since dispensaries and bakeries are using a non-approved ingredient in food products, the product is considered to be high risk, he said.

Island Health sent a letter to dispensaries on March 29 reinforcing the ban. The health authority said it is working with the City of Victoria, and that any dispensaries that continue to sell edibles could see their request for a business licence rejected.

In his letter, Tousaw said this is an ‚Äúimplicit threat to interfere and harm the business licensing prospects of dispensaries that continue to service their patients by providing access to cannabis edibles.‚Äù He said such action might cause damages to dispensaries and their patients ‚Äúfor which Island Health could be found liable.‚Äù

Tousaw wrote that Island‚Äôs Health approach to edibles has been ‚Äúfear, regression and a refusal to grow. Fear because despite cannabis edibles being available in Victoria in dispensaries for 20 years, there is essentially no evidence of any harm being caused to any individual as a result.‚Äù

Brandon Wright, general manager of Baked Edibles, which supplies marijuana-infused cookies, spreads and other products to dispensaries, said he hopes the letter will ‚Äúgive [Island Health] pause before taking action that is clearly unconstitutional and clearly harmful to the community.‚Äù

Wright said none of the dispensaries he supplies have reduced their orders for cannabis edibles in light of the ban.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt see a push back yet. There‚Äôs been a lot of strength in the community because they know they‚Äôre on the side of what‚Äôs legally and morally right.‚Äù

Tousaw said his clients want to work with Island Health to satisfy any legitimate health concerns without interrupting patient access to edible products.

Unlike the City of Vancouver, which has banned edible marijuana products, the City of Victoria does not specifically mention edibles in its regulations for marijuana businesses.

The federal task force on marijuana legalization has recommended edibles be allowed as long as they are not marketed toward children. The task force also urged a ban on products that mix marijuana with alcohol or caffeine.""

For starters, I'm subletting a place from another student from January 1st-April 30th, so I've been here under two weeks, though I'm already noticing some concerning trends that have me worried for how the remainder of my time here might go. I went through quite the size downgrade in moving to Victoria, so getting all of my stuff unpacked and settled has been a bit of a challenge so far. As a result, I have 3-4 small boxes (not much bigger than a shoebox) in the common area and a couple other little things laying about (a snapback, pair of shoes by the door, and a guitar beside my bedroom door). The laundry machines are in the basement suite, so once weekly the landlord comes down to do her laundry.

Today, she knocked on my door and had me and my roommate both come out for an impromptu meeting. She pretty much gave us a rundown that she wants us doing our dishes daily (as opposed to three times weekly like we have been), taking shorter showers, keeping all of the lights except our bedroom lights off at any time we're not in the kitchen or other public spaces of the suite (there is no living room), and remove all personal items from any common spaces in the house as they are a fire hazard. Prior to today, she had come into the suite on two separate occasions to turn off the lights, but I didn't think much of this. She closed this meeting by glancing into my bedroom and commenting that I had clothes on my floor that needed to be cleaned up ASAP or she would have to take action. 

I'm not one to live in any sort of filth or untidy living quarters, but to have my landlord come into our basement suite unannounced (her laundry day varies) and proceed to demand we remove certain things, adhere to all of these living restrictions, and comment on my laundry within my private bedroom seems to be going a bit far. I'm not running for the hills by any means, but as my lease only began 10 days ago and this is already escalating, I worry that the remaining 3 1/2 months may only lead to more problems. As a tenant, do I have any way to counteract this or even just keep doing things the way I have been? (I should add that my roommate has many of his things in the common areas as well and neither of us have voiced any concern about this). Is an early end to my lease feasible, or even possible at all?

I have a 21"" x 27"" painting that has been stretched already (which poses a restriction on scanning it through a roller scanner) and I was hoping to get it scanned and printed for a couple people for Christmas. I was told to contact Prism Imaging in Victoria so I gave them a call today, and they told me that the ""basic"" package alone to scan it would be $90, and each print onto poster paper would be around $66 (onto canvas would be around $99).

This seems absolutely ludicrous to me and since only time and $50 went into this painting there's no way I'm paying nearly $200 just to scan and print it.

Does anyone have any alternatives or good experiences elsewhere?

You had great advice regarding my last WCT question, so here I am again. I am wondering if the beaches along the WCT retain grills for campfire cooking? I know that most people bring stoves, and so will I, but cooking over an open campfire is one of life's simple pleasures.


I anticipate that most people on the WCT practice the leave no trace philosophy, and so there won't be grills. There certainly weren't any on the Lake Superior Coastal Trail or on La Cloche Silhouette Trail (Both in Ontario).


Instead of cutting green wood (prohibited I think), I am considering bringing a light backpacker's grill like those made by Purcell Trench. This would be quite the luxury as I otherwise pack quite lightly. So I wanted to double check with you before I drop the cash on a Purcell Trench grill and then commit to the extra 150 grams.

Dan McLaughlin, who said that most of us welcome the ban, has never spoken to a survivor of sexual violence and it shows. Of the dozens of women I have worked with, only one has said she wanted the ban (because her trial was high profile). Dan's comments are dismissive and harmful. He does not speak for us. None of us were ever consulted for him to have that opinion,  and we are arguably the loudest people in the province on the topic.

[12]       The purpose of a section 486.4 publication ban is to encourage the reporting of sexual offences by protecting the privacy and identity of the alleged victim. However, in my respectful view, when a victim of a sexual assault comes before the court, as Ms. Favro has, and asks to have a publication ban lifted so that they can openly discuss and publish the details of the offence, including identifying themselves as the victim, the request ought to be respected and granted unless there is a strong and articulable reason why the ban should remain in place. In the present case, I can find none.

A police sergeant in Oak Bay, B.C., has been demoted and barred from seeking a promotion for one year after he was investigated for corruption, neglect of duty and using intoxicants.

The Oak Bay Police Department was made aware of allegations against then Sgt. Davindar Dalep in October 2020.

The department says it immediately requested an external investigation of the veteran officer from the Office of the Public Complaints Commission (OPCC), the independent office of the B.C. legislature that oversees investigations of municipal police in the province.

""Given the nature of the allegations, the member was assigned to administrative duties and his weapons were seized,"" Oak Bay police Chief Ray Bernoties told CTV News.

The OPCC ordered the Victoria Police Department to investigate the matter and serve as the disciplinary authority in the case.

After more than 15 months, the investigation reached its conclusion on Feb. 2, substantiating allegations of misuse of intoxicants, discreditable conduct, corrupt practice, and two instances of neglect of duty, according to the Oak Bay Police Department.

Dalep, who started with the Oak Bay police in 1998 and was promoted to sergeant in 2017, was sanctioned with a reduction in rank from sergeant to first-class constable. He is prohibited from seeking a promotion for one year and must gain the chief's approval first.

In a phone interview Thursday, the sanctioned officer told CTV News he was fully cooperative with investigators and is relieved to be back on patrol in Oak Bay.

""I had a difficult year and a half and I took responsibility,"" Dalep said. ""I made a mistake and I owned up to it. The police [investigators] did the right job and I'm back to patrol because I did the right things to get back to patrol.""

Bernoties confirmed Dalep has returned to regular duties as a constable under the supervision of a sergeant.

VICTORIA -- BC Ferries has removed its Wi-Fi services on vessels sailing along its most popular routes, following numerous complaints about its quality.

The internet service was powered down on July 5 for the following routes: Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay, and Horseshoe Bay to Langdale.

BC Ferries says the move comes after years of increasing complaints about the poor connection quality, and the lack of a feasible replacement system.

 ""Extensive research and analysis of various technology solutions has shown it is not possible to improve the Wi-Fi service on our ferries to the level expected by users and we continually receive complaints about the quality and reliability of the service,"" reads an update on the BC Ferries website.

BC Ferries first introduced Wi-Fi aboard sailings in 2010 through its own land-based radio devices.

The company says that over the past 11 years, demand for the Wi-Fi has risen from about 40 to 50 users per sailing to more than 900, which strains the system.

Any replacement system, such as satellite or cellular technology, would be prohibitively expensive and would likely be unable to accommodate the volume of users per sailing, according to BC Ferries.

An airline can offer internet services for passengers because planes carry far fewer passengers than the roughly 900 passengers that sail on larger BC Ferries vessels, says the company.

Moreover, changes in radio standards means that Wi-Fi coverage would be even worse in the future if BC Ferries kept its current system in place.

""The existing Wi-Fi service runs on a ship-to-shore network using wireless network radios which we would need to upgrade and certify under newer, stricter Radio Frequency (RF) regulations,"" says the company.

""These newer radio devices have a large reduction in the amount of power we can apply to its network radios, which would further reduce the reliability and quality of onboard Wi-Fi.""

Free Wi-Fi service is still available at most BC Ferries terminals, including Tsawwassen, Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay, and more than a dozen others.

BC Ferries notes that cellular coverage is still available on most routes, meaning people with data plans on their cellphones can still connect to the internet.",VictoriaBC,BC Ferries removes Wi-Fi from from major sailing routes,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/pabs29/bc_ferries_removes_wifi_from_from_major_sailing/

***article continues below***

A Victoria church has been holding in-person Sunday services with up to 50 people attending, despite provincial orders that prohibit all religious gatherings until January.

Oaklands Bible Chapel, at 2736 Fernwood Rd., has held in-person services three times since provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry issued an order suspending all events and gatherings until Jan. 8. In a Dec. 6 sermon recorded inside the church and posted to YouTube, the church‚Äôs pastor, Dan Anderson, said they would be holding in-person services on Dec. 6, 13 and 20.

Neighbour AJ Hildebrand has watched people stream into the church for the past three Sundays, and he‚Äôs noticed the church is advertising their in-person services online.

He said he was disappointed and ‚Äúin shock‚Äù after discovering the church was hosting up to 50 people inside.

‚ÄúAn institution that is supposed to be about brotherly love and building the community is in fact jeopardizing it and stressing it,‚Äù he said.

On the second Sunday, he watched at least 25 people go into the building, many of whom were not wearing masks, he said. ‚ÄúEvents like this can be super dangerous.‚Äù

By the third week, he decided to ask the church why they were violating the public health order. In a video he shared with the Times Colonist, he spoke to the pastor on Sunday, who told him there were 50 people inside the church.

Anderson, who was not wearing a mask inside the church, deferred questions about the service to a sermon posted to YouTube.

During that Dec. 6 sermon, recorded inside the church and posted to YouTube, Anderson said the church followed the order for the first two Sundays after it went into effect on Nov. 19. But by the third Sunday, they decided to violate the order, he said.

He goes on to question the province‚Äôs response to the pandemic, saying guidelines are arbitrarily enforced and doctors in other countries have differing opinions on COVID-19 than B.C. public health officials. He claims without evidence that B.C.‚Äôs pandemic regulations are based on initial death toll predictions rather than current data on case counts.

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt pan out the way they said it was going to pan out,‚Äù he said, making the argument that the virus has not caused as much harm as predicted.

The pastor called the province‚Äôs reaction ‚Äúa little bit disproportionate,‚Äù and invoked the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, saying Canadians are being denied their rights, and it‚Äôs the church‚Äôs responsibility to speak up when others are being targeted by government.

In his sermon, the pastor denied the existence of transgender people, called abortion ‚Äúmurder,‚Äù and said marriage should only happen between a man and a woman.

Oaklands Bible Chapel did not respond to a call and email requesting an interview.

Hildebrand said he reported the church to Victoria police after the first service, but he‚Äôs disappointed in their response. He spoke to an officer who said she talked to someone at the church, and they wouldn‚Äôt be holding another in-person service, Hildebrand said.

Hildebrand noticed the church stopped advertising its Sunday service after that, but then a notice went up again, and he informed VicPD.

‚ÄúI respect the need for diplomacy here, but I think when people, and particularly an organization, are openly defying just and conscionable health orders, I really think people who are entrusted to protect our community should take a bigger position,‚Äù he said.

VicPD did not respond to a request for comment.

Hildebrand said he is worried a lack of enforcement against the church will embolden others to put people at risk.

‚ÄúI fear that other people are just going to say ‚Äòforget it.‚Äô It‚Äôs going to be a cascade effect,‚Äù he said.

Several churches on the Lower Mainland have been fined for continuing to gather despite the public health order banning gatherings. In a news release, Chilliwack RCMP said officers worked with regional health officers to try to gain voluntary compliance after congregants gathered on Dec. 6 and 13 at three separate churches.

On Thursday, police charged the churches with eight counts of failing to comply with the order and issued fines totalling $18,400.

The public health order does not prohibit people from visiting their place of worship for individual contemplation or prayer, and religious services can be held online.

The artisan Panettone from Laurel Pt and Fol Epi is delicious, but cost prohibitive - seriously - $40???  Good thing I was sharing cost with neighbors who were also feeling the call of culinary adventures of the season. My ideal Panettone is rich eggy bread that is not too sweet, but loaded with dried orange peel and good quality raisins (and bonus points for currants and using real butter.) I am delighted to say that the winner hands down is a $12 loaf from Maria's Deli (a fantastic hole in the wall family deli with the best pasta selection in town - not upscale- just old european quality.) The brand is Maina Panettone Classico and at 700grams of fluffy but firm rich eggy sweet fruity goodness you better believe I went back and bought two more. Enjoy Victoria!

 A Beacon Hill Park camper choked, suffocated and strangled his common-law partner almost every day for six months, in a campaign of violence that left her ‚Äúbruised, battered and emotionally destroyed.‚Äù

That information was revealed Thursday at Joshua Miller‚Äôs sentencing hearing in Victoria provincial court. The 35-year-old homeless man pleaded guilty to assaulting the victim from Jan. 1 to July 12, 2020, and threatening to kill her during the same time period.

‚ÄúThe facts are truly horrendous,‚Äù said provincial court Judge Mayland McKimm as he sentenced Miller to nine months in jail, followed by three years of probation.

‚ÄúOn a daily basis, Mr. Miller would threaten, terrorize and assault the victim and, by his own admission, committed acts of violence that were atrocious and disgusting.‚Äù

Crown prosecutor Paul Pearson told the court that Miller had been in a relationship with the woman, whose identity is protected by a court order, since 2018. Before she met him, the victim had a job and money in her bank account. Their relationship was fraught with conflict and violence, and she ended up living with Miller in a tent in Beacon Hill Park from early 2020 into the summer.

Almost every day, Miller would assault her, putting the weight of his body on hers, his hands around her throat, and strangling her, said Pearson. Twice, she lost control of her bladder and almost lost consciousness.

‚ÄúHe would not stop strangling her, even when she screamed for help,‚Äù said Pearson. ‚ÄúShe had bruises all over the body ‚Ä¶ Every day, he would grab her by the side of the throat or put his fist up to the side of her head and use his fist to dig into her face or her body to hurt her.‚Äù

When she tried to phone police, Miller would stop her, he said.

The couple was provided housing in the Travelodge at 123 Gorge Rd. East, one of the hotels leased by the province as emergency housing for people living in homeless encampments.

But the assaults continued ‚Äî there were so many complaints about Miller‚Äôs abuse of the victim that he was barred from the building, said Pearson. That didn‚Äôt stop Miller, who continued to come into the building and physically assault and threaten the victim, the prosecutor said.

Victoria police became aware of the situation and began to investigate. The victim gave a statement to police, then recanted after being pressured by Miller. After he was arrested, she confirmed her original statement.

Miller came from an abusive background, said Pearson. His father abused him and he was sexually abused by another adult. He left home at 12, and had been working at The Keg, but said he left that job to devote more time to the victim.

Miller saw himself as a leader and provider for many in the homeless community during the pandemic, but he was heavily addicted to alcohol and using street narcotics on a regular basis. When he drank, he would lose control and his behaviour would escalate, said Pearson.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly concerning that he has no ability to control his level of violence.‚Äù

Defence lawyer Stephen Suntock, who has represented Miller since 2014, said his client understands the ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù nature of his behaviour. ‚ÄúWhen he came into custody, he indicated he did not wish to seek bail and would be pleading guilty. He was sickened by what he had done to \[the victim\] and is genuinely remorseful for his behaviour.‚Äù

Substance abuse underlies all Miller‚Äôs violent behaviour, said Suntock.

In her victim impact statement, the young woman told the judge Miller‚Äôs physical, emotional and mental abuse made her question her own sanity, saying he told her repeatedly that she was crazy.

She said she continues to be terrified that he will try to find her and kill her. ‚ÄúIt got to the point where Josh was strangling me daily. I would beg for my life and he would respond that he was going to make sure I died,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have no reason to believe he won‚Äôt try to hurt me.‚Äù

The accused told the judge he would leave Vancouver Island and never contact the victim again.

McKimm said Miller‚Äôs serious history of violence is an aggravating factor in the case ‚Äî of his 12 prior convictions for assault, all but two involve intimate partners. But the judge noted that the accused has accepted responsibility for his actions.

‚ÄúHis remorse is as genuine as the terror he inflicted,‚Äù he said.

McKimm reluctantly accepted a joint submission from the Crown and defence of a nine-month sentence, saying a sentence of 12 to 18 months would be more appropriate.

During his probation, Miller must have no contact with the victim or her family, or be anywhere on Vancouver Island south of the Malahat. He is not allowed to use drugs or alcohol and must obey a curfew of 9 p.m to 6 a.m. for the first year, even if he is in a tent.

He must not enter into or continue any relationship until his partner has been told by his probation officer about his convictions.

Miller is required to take counselling and treatment for anger management, violence prevention, alcohol or drug abuse, spousal abuse prevention and mental health, and must attend forensic psychiatric services, as directed by his probation officer.

McKimm also imposed a lifetime weapons and firearms prohibition.

Patrol officers were first called to a business in the 800-block of Esquimalt Road on Thursday, May 17th for a report of two men who had passed counterfeit currency. Officers recognized one of the suspects from the description and began to search for him and his accomplice.

The next day, Patrol officers were called to the 1500-block of Fort Street in Victoria at approximately 2:45 p.m. for a report of a two men who appeared to be taking off handcuffs. The description of one of these men matched that of one of the fraud suspects from the previous day‚Äôs file. Patrol officers searched the area, but did not locate the suspects.

An hour later, Patrol officers spotted the fraud suspects near the intersection of Douglas and Yates streets in downtown Victoria. They stopped the men to take them into custody. One of the men turned away from the officers and refused to show his hands. He then turned back towards the officers with a knife in his hand. An officer was able to safely disarm him and Patrol officers began to take him into custody. The man then began to fight with officers and OC spray was deployed to help take him into custody.

When this first man was searched, Patrol officers discovered that he was in possession of five knives, including a prohibited switchblade, an asp baton, bear spray, illegal drugs, a replica handgun and over $7,000 in counterfeit currency. Patrol officers have since linked this man to at least two additional fraud investigations. He was held in custody for court, with officers recommending 29 charges including six counts of possession of concealed weapons, five counts of fraud under $5,000, two counts of possession of a controlled substance, one count of possession of counterfeit currency, one count of possession of a prohibited weapon, eight counts of breach of probation and six counts of breach of recognizance. Patrol officers believe that the man may be involved in additional frauds involving counterfeit currency.

The second man was arrested for breaching his probation and released on a promise to appear.

**Legal marijuana will make Canada safer**

On July 1, 2018, marijuana is going to be legalized in Canada. However, there is no need to fear. In fact, Canadians should feel more at ease as July 1 approaches.

Legalization means many things for Canadians. Once a substance is legalized, it directly and aggressively hemorrhages revenue from the black market. When criminal organizations lose money, they lose power. When they lose power, they lose their ability to negatively affect society.

This will be akin to what occurred when prohibition ceased in the United States. All these criminal organizations lost their power and wealth once alcohol was re-legalized. Legalization, in turn, made society at large safer and more hospitable.

Marijuana is commonly, but incorrectly, called ‚Äúa gateway drug.‚Äù This so-called ‚Äúgateway effect‚Äù is caused by the black market. This is because drug dealers who sell weed typically sell a variety of other substances as well. The dealers then offer to sell these other substances to their buyers.

This environment is what causes people to try different narcotics, not marijuana itself. When marijuana is legalized, and people no longer need to seek out shady dealers, it is likely that the testing of more serious substances will dramatically decline.

So, Canadians, do not fear, a safer Canada is near.
