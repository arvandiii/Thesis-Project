Some words, in case it's helpful:

I empathize with the need to evaluate alternate corridors to better transport people through Kelowna and surrounding regions ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a topic of discussion for over 40 years ‚Äî and I appreciate this effort to illustrate technically feasible options and provide a venue to solicit community feedback.

Understanding options are very limited, due to geological logistics, it makes sense this consultation explore the concept of gutting Rose Valley, Rose Valley Regional Park, Shannon Woods, Tallus Ridge, Glenrosa, and Smith Creek for a new four-lane, high-speed highway running through West Kelowna. If this option was absent from your investigation, it would offer no options, apart from upgrading the existing corridor. So putting aside the fact that this highway would run through my home, I respect the energy and process in place to explore and present potential solutions.

As you move forward into ‚ÄúPhase 2, Part 2‚Äù of your consultation, where you make recommendations and have ongoing community and stakeholder dialogue, residents of West Kelowna propose that you explicitly remove the following alternate corridor options from your evaluation:

* Option 1A: Trepanier Road to Smith Creek Road
* Option 1B: Highway 97/97C Junction to Smith Creek Road
* Connector: Smith Creek to Bartley Road
* Option 2A: Bartley Road to Bear Creek / Westside Road
* Option 2B: Bartley Road Extension

The impact these options would impose on West Kelowna geologically, to residents, and to the community, would be devastating and irreversible. It would irresponsible and embarrassing for them to remain in your consultation options through ‚ÄúPhase 2, Part 2‚Äù.

The value West Kelowna offers, is anchored in outdoor recreation, coupled with a quiet, family-oriented lifestyle. Permanently destroying the sensitive natural parkland in this region, completely eliminates the value and appeal West Kelowna has to offer residents or guests.

The city of West Kelowna sacrificing its most valuable assets: our parkland, our wildlife, our water supply, our residential neighbourhoods, our bedrock ‚Äî to save commuters tens of minutes, and introduce ‚Äòdowntown appeal‚Äô, is short-sighted at best. It‚Äôs better described by other commenters as ridiculous, ludicrous, absurd, shocking, ignorant, and disgusting.

The only option is upgrading the existing corridor, but it sounds like the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was mandated to explore a bypass, by the district (?). This is the root of the problem, since a bypass is illogical, and these options are the resulting symptoms.

Moving forward through ‚ÄúPhase 2, Part 2‚Äù, MOTI‚Äôs recommendations should consist of:

* Upgrading the existing corridor with interchanges / trenching
* Establishing a roadmap for maintenance and upgrades to our existing lake crossing
* Evaluating more invasive changes to traffic infrastructure Main Street / Dobbin Road
* Proposing more forward-thinking options, such as light rail and improvements to public transit to move people (not vehicles) through Kelowna. It‚Äôs clear a negligible amount of congestion is imposed by commuters just passing through, and you should be presenting modern solutions looking forward to 2040.

A bypass is not an option. It‚Äôs akin to consciously choosing to inflict more devastation than the wildfires we‚Äôve experienced, or inevitably will experience in the future.

It‚Äôs time for this 40+ year discussion to course correct.

Thank you /r/Okanagan!

*EDIT: to be clear, improving the existing corridor is one of the options on the table, versus creating a completely alternate route through existing residential areas and parkland.

My BF has been offered a job in the Okanagan area and we're considering relocation from Sk. There isn't an office so he would work from home, with 80% of travel work being done in Kelowna, the remainder as far as Osoyoos to Kamloops. 

We've got two dogs and a cat that require a decently sized fenced yard. We're not old enough to get into some of the sweet 45+ communities around Kelowna and they all seem to have ridiculous pet restrictions. From what I can tell, the adults communities, and rental units of Kelowna don't seem to care for dogs.  

We're hoping to stay within 30 to 40 minutes drive to Kelowna. 

Hoping to not have to rent, but finding a 3 br HOUSE with a yard under 400,000 is proving difficult. 

Also would love any advice from anyone who has made a move like this before.
