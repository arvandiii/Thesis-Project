I had created a post about the state of Chilliwack lake road, as this was my first go to camping spot, however after finding out the road around the lake is in poor conditions, it doesn't seems like I'll be able to drive in.

I am wanting to find a free camping spot (I don't need any amenities- obviously since I am looking for free hehe) and not up in the mountains- the reason being the weather difference. I am not wanting to hit below 0 at night, not wanting to hit any snow, or just really cold weather in general- I know it will be cold wherever I go, but just minimizing the cold as much as I can. Would love to be by some type of water source. And a place where I can chop dead fall or find fire wood...

I was thinking Harrison lake, but would love to explore new territories for myself. What about cultus lake? Are there any pull off spots there? 

Are there even any pull off spots around Vedder river? or some type of water source?

Also- Just looking at Chilliwack lake weather for fun- I guess it is up in the mountains. I didn't realize that. Calls for snow all week.

https://you.leadnow.ca/petitions/tell-loblaws-reinstate-hero-pay-for-frontline-workers

The living wage for Toronto as of 2019 is 20.08$/hr working full time. Despite this, most clerks at grocery stores make 14$/hr.

A lot of them per my friends/family who work in Loblaws have their part timer hours either below 10hrs/week or deliberately kept just under 40hrs/week as for the company not to have to give them benefits.

They have no stability in their hours. Schedules are often changed last minute in the same week despite union contract stating they have to post schedules 2 weeks in advance.

These clerks are literally risking their lives everyday to bring food on our tables. I work in healthcare and think it's abysmal. Just because they don't have quote 'professional' jobs it doesn't mean we don't need to treat them with respect. I actually feel more scared for workers working at grocery stores ATM than myself. I bet most can barely afford to put food on their own tables.

They are scared of speaking up or calling in sick as their income is so low or they are afraid of getting fired.  So more Covid.

One friend also working for Loblaws  told me they were going to get interviewed by 2 newspapers but the newspapers were ultimately denied permission to talk to them by Loblaws a few months back when the journalists asked for formal permission - keep in  most workers interviewed for articles is are actual union stewards as well and my friend isn't. They think it's because they are afraid of more whistle blowers and want to control their PR. Sounds like musling to me. Very 1984.

I slipped on flip flops and booked it outside to find a strange scene. My mom's van was 10ft and 90° from where it was parked, on top of our garden bed, and the whole ass end was unrecognizable. 


At that point I realized that I was hearing the whirling of the tires still engaged and spinning at the back of the red BMW on my lawn, aswell as multiple people calling 911.


There were already people gathered and a tall gentleman from on Leary (thank you so much for being there giant red beard hero guy) immediately took over and requested someone get his med kit from home. 


We booked it to the address given on foot, which was right around the corner. My hubby ran up to the door, knocked furiously, and a lovely lady ran to get the med pack we requested.  


The police were there within moments, the ambulance was a heartbeat behind, and firetrucks momentarily after. Thank you, to all our first responders. They were working like a well oiled machine, and got Dude out right away.


Dude in the BMW was put on a stretcher  and put in the ambulance, and stablized. I sincerely hope he's ok.


 One witness said that he was doing about 120km/h down Wells Rd. My home, with my (supposed to be) sleeping children right next to the exterior wall, was  like 10ft from where he impacted my husband's front end.


 Hubby waited up until the vehicles had all been towed away before attempting sleep. I smoked a bowl and crashed around 12:30am. The youngest wanted to sleep in our bed as he was still pretty freaked out and shook up.


 A few thoughts keep surfacing. Firstly, (of course) I hope Dude is ok. I hope he has no lasting I'll effects. 


Secondly, why was he going so fast?
If it was a medical event, is he going to be ok? He was still stomping on the gas as I approached the vehicle initially, so I sure hope it wasn't clotting related, like a stroke. 


Lastly, how on earth did he manage to miss my mom's kidney car donation vehicle? He hit every other object in his path. My neighbors fence, 2 vehicles, our address signage, 10 years of landscaping...the list is extensive. But, some how, some way, he missed the junker by meer inches. Hilarious really.


That said, my grandma's pink dogwood tree is likely unsalvageable (I'm told it's rare and there's no way we could afford to replace it). Her smoke bush has a bit of a better chance I think, so we will assess today, replant what we can, and lament the roses that are beyond repair. 


Also destroyed was a 30+yo plum tree. The trunk was a meter around and it was obliterated. Branches had to be dragged off the road. The two (now 1) plum trees are beloved of my family because of their gorgeous spring blossoms, but were also an important food source and established homes for local wildlife. I'm so sad that the tree's going to be mulched up and forgotten. 


One upside is that I realized I need to renew my CPR and first aid certification as I was super hesitant to jump in. Also, I now will carry a first aid kit on my person instead of just in the car. Don't know why I didn't sooner.


So, Dude in the BMW. I hope you are ok. Red-beard the medic and wife, you are amazing. Thank you for taking charge of the scene and running that medic bag over. Everyone who came to help, thank you so much for your support. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading.


Update:  I have sadly been informed that BMW dude did not make it.

I spend a good portion of my time on steam playing games and smoking wayyyy too many cigarettes.

 I really dont know anyone here and I was hoping i could find some like minded people to chill with, and help me discover some of the neater parts of town.

Sadly I dont have a vehicle or bicycle (as of yet) so I get stuck walking for the most part, but thats probably better for me right now. I do have a pass for the next year to prospera leisure center so even if someone would like to go for ice skating (i dont like swimming) or hit the gym as a buddy and some motivation.

As you can probably tell I need to get outta the damned house and meet some cool people! 

On the far far end of the spectrum my girlie and I are ents and kinda could use a hook up as well(us damned island hippies) for you know what. PM me bout that one.

Thanks /r/chilliwack so far, there has been nothing but awesome for me and hope that there is more!

EDIT: I should probably let you guys know a bit more about myself, don't be afraid to shoot me a msg!

As already stated I spend too much time on my computer, I like to work with 3D animation software and am currently trying to teach myself C++. Im fairly close to the four corners area, I would like to get a bit more fit and active (again as already stated) I probably have a slower pace than most are used to in my life due to growing up in a relaxed atmosphere that island kids get to experience. I like to meet people and even just chill at the park and burn one down, or what have you. I'd like to get more aquianted with the area and resources to keep myself from getting too bored. I like me a nice beer, but the no job keeps my budget pretty tight on that end. 

So in short if you're looking for someone to chill with thats pretty laid back and gets along with near anyone, leave a comment or pm me. 

thanks again guys!

#What is it?#
It's a collection of chat rooms specifically for BC folk who want a little more *social* in their social lives.

#How's it work?#
Click [the link](https://discord.gg/qPMj39RFrg), say hi, and start meeting new friends.  You can run Discord either in your browser or download and install the application to your computer / phone.  Completely free and pretty darn easy.

The server is divided into chat rooms based on topics of interest, like #videogames, #food-n-cooking, and #hockey, etc.  There's even the age-restricted #adults-only room for those who like that sort of thing.  :)  Drop into the rooms that interest you and meet others in your area with the same interests.  There's something for everyone, but in case there isn't, stop by the #suggestions room and propose a new topic!

#Why?  What's the point?#

Every week or so there's another post in one of the BC subreddits saying something like ""How do you make friends here?"" or ""Hi, I'm new, looking for friends!""  I've moved more than 15 times across three countries and this is a situation that I've been in many times myself.  Everywhere I went, to make friends I started looking for groups to join or, if there were no groups, I started them myself.  That that's what this is, a first step to bring people together around common interests to help people be social and maybe make a few new friends.
