I am new to Reddit and maybe soon I will be new to Grand Forks. My husband and I (along with our two toddlers) are thinking of moving to the area. Can anyone tell me about services such as a library, hospital, children's activities/ playgrounds and elementary schools/ daycares?

Is the area safe (from violent crime?) 
Is the area often impacted by fires or floods?
Are the highways in and out of town easy to drive?
Is the weather pleasant?

We have lived in the central interior, Okanagan and on Vancouver Island but have never even visited the Kootenays so any information will be greatly appreciated :)",grandforksbc,Moving to Grand Forks (or Creston?),0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandforksbc/comments/scftyc/moving_to_grand_forks_or_creston/
