Whoa! Have the homes for sale ever jumped up in price ridiculously !!

Are you guys in a home flipper's market?

There were homes i looked online( going back 5 years or less)  that were older 1930/40/50s era , 2-3 bdrms, hardly any to none renovations , ugly unkempt front and backyards, no nice landscaping or back yard patio decks, no secondary suites. What was $485-$525,000 are currently $640K. 

And the previously $575K-$650 K are currently $740K- $999K. 

Seems a majority of the homes for sale have been renovated inside very nicely, the big backyards have had professional landscaping/ hardscaping  ( cement or wood patios, covers, fire pits, outdoor lighting, paving stones, etc). 

Reminds me of all the Home and Garden TV shows where you see  fixer uppers/ flip or stay, professional interior decoration, etc. 

Are there a lot of home owners or contractors/developers buying up everything they see just to renovate and flip in 6 months or a year? 

I noticed even the condos, townhouses that were 15-30+ years are much nicer inside with fancy renovations and what looks to be higher quality floors, fixtures, counter tops, appliances.

Two bedroom or three bedroom townhomes that would of sold for about $300-325k are now $499-600K+.

Like, is everybody renovating their older homes/townhouses/condos and even over 55 trailer park homes for a quick high profit sale to potential Vancouver, calgary/toronto buyers?? 

or is there other issues going on i am not aware of?
