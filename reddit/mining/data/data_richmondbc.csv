I managed to meet him and asked him to pickup after himself and not discard on the ground.

His response was that he would look after his own butts but only his - fine by me.

Fast forward to a couple months later and he's back to dropping his butts on the ground again.

I spoke to the Richmond Bylaw team and they said they would not be able to do anything about this as it's not a big enough issue.

I'm concerned about the littering - it's ugly, but come summer, this is also a fire hazard.

So here are the numbers

Firefighters 200 \[According to this\]([https://firerescue.richmond.ca/who-we-are/our-history/#:\~:text=At%20Present,in%20the%20community%20of%20Richmond](https://firerescue.richmond.ca/who-we-are/our-history/#:~:text=At%20Present,in%20the%20community%20of%20Richmond))

RCMP 200 \[According to this, based in 2012 though so the number probably has grown\]([https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-225-x/2012000/t019-eng.htm](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-225-x/2012000/t019-eng.htm))

Paramedics..... Approx. 32

I wasn't able to find solid information on number of paramedics so 32 is based on a calculation from what I understand. There are a total of 3 Primary Care Paramedic (PCP) ambulances during the day, 1 Advanced Care Paramedic (ACP) ambulance that serve the general public. Do note, after midnight there is only 2 PCP ambulances and 1 ACP ambulance. There are also Critical Care Paramedics based out of YVR but they don't respond to normal calls in Richmond, there's also a bike squad at YVR but once again, not really responding to normal calls. So my numbers are based solely on PCP and ACP ambulances.

It takes 8 paramedics to staff a car from platoon rotations, so 8x4 gives us 32. This is a simple approximate number, but even if doubled because I'm completely off and horrible at math, it still doesn't put paramedics close to the numbers of other emergency services. I have just written my MLA about this, please do the same.

Now fun little fact, there are  7 fire halls in Richmond but 2 ambulance stations. The most recent fire hall completed costed taxpayers $24.4 million and it's located in the Brighouse area, I'm quite sure most have driven by it.

This is for a population of 227,406 according to the Richmond Fire Rescue page.

Ive switched up my classes to get a quick AS degree to bulk up my immigration profile. And out of no where, IBM sent out an ad to teach anyone quantum physics in less than a year which is exactly what I've been hoping and praying for recently. Its online, FREE, and linear in mathematics. If all goes well, by March 2021, I'll have a certificate of completion in quantum computing. With added computer languages, I hope to apply to D Wave, or at least a company in the tech industry. 

All in all, we're still setting up plans to immigrate to BC through job offer/education advances: any University suggestions for a Computer Science major and or Asian Studies?

More often than not, it's not because they are an asshole, it's that they are trying to help you from getting into an accident, getting a ticket, or both.  

Usually it's a double tap flash or rapid succession or a single long duration (few seconds) before turning off. Sometimes it's someone shutting off their headlights completely and turning them on.

I try to help others as much as I can (as I've seen so many people get smoked from behind because the car behind them couldn't see their car or pedestrians nearly getting clipped because the car had its lights off, but it seems nearly no one in Richmond know why they get a high beam anymore.  

While there are a few reasons why people high beam, here are the main ones.   Ask your pals or family if they know what it means.  It could save them from a ticket or an accident.


- your lights are off at night (either from an oncoming car or one behind you) - this is the number one reason why I high beam others. 

- there is a speed trap ahead (oncoming traffic)

- there is a danger or an accident in the direction you're heading (oncoming traffic)


- your high beams are on (oncoming traffic) [side note: if you get high beamed alot and you know your lights are on and your high beams are off, it's highly likely you have misaligned headlights that are blinding other drivers; conversely, if you are getting high beamed and can't see, look down and to the right of the road as you pass the car - this'll save you from getting blinded, particularly on a dark Highway)


- In slow traffic or merge, someone is giving you the right of way and they want you to go ahead of them

- in flowing traffic, someone is asking you to move over to the slow lane (that's the right lane) so they can pass  (from traffic behind you)

- if they flash you back after you did any of the above, it's them saying ""Thanks!"" [You can flash your hazards to say thanks to the person behind you]

- someone is letting you know where they are (every direction) [e.g. a good use for this is when coming out a blind corner, a parkade, or driveway at night and you use your high beams to reflect light so you can take notice] 

- if someone keeps their high beams on from behind you and they don't turn it off, it's likely you did something dumb on the road (e.g. cut them off, abrupt lane change, with or without indicators causing panic) and they are pretty much saying you're an asshole. Usually a horn is in there somewhere lol. 


Hopefully this helps someone the next time they get a flash.",richmondbc,Why do people high beam me while I'm driving?,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/richmondbc/comments/n6qvqx/why_do_people_high_beam_me_while_im_driving/
