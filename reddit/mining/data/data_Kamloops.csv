We have had a TON of posts recently ( understandably ) about the fire situations, possible evacuations and overall general conditions regarding travel and air quality etc.

Please feel free to update this post with any information that you feel is relevant or that may help others to find the info that they need.  I will provide some overall good links that people can use to help them locate the assistance they may be looking for.

As of August 21,2023 the largest fire closest to Kamloops is the Ross Moore lake wildfire.  This has been burning for quite some time, but so far has only threatened areas outside of the city limits, to the best of my knowledge.  Kamloops itself has no evacuations due to this fire, although there are evacuations in place outside the city limits.  There is of course the Bush Creek East wildfire at the Shuswap which has caused a tremendous amount of damage and displaced many people and their families.  This fire is still quite a ways from Kamloops, but you can expect a lot of smoke from that fire to end up here.  The other fire of note is of course the Mcdougall creek fire in Kelowna / West Kelowna.  This fire is not threatening Kamloops at all, but we will see significant smoke from it, and of course we will see evacuees from the area.

Kamloops is on a list of areas where the government has advised to avoid all non essential travel due to the fire situation.  You also can not get hotel rooms or use camp sites in the area unless you are an evacuee, to free up those spots for fire victims.  Please abide by these rules for all non essential travel if you can, leave the room for people that don't have a house and need those spaces right now.  Highway 1 is currently closed between Chase and Sorrento due to the Bush Creek East fire jumping Shuswap lake and moving over the highway.

For further updates please check the following resources:

[https://www.kamloops.ca/](https://www.kamloops.ca/) City of Kamloops website should contain up to date info regarding any active emergencies or evacuations , should they be needed.

[https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/map](https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/map) The BC Wildfire map, which shows pretty up to date fire info , including current evacuations, estimated fire sizes and where the fires are approximately.

""These were drawn from a stockpile of notes and recipes et cetera that I have collected over many years and keep in an even larger collection of binders at home,” he said in the reply.

“At no time was there any discussion of an Alchemy recipe book.”

Swann said the cookbook was his personal property and never belonged to Alchemy or Renner.

“Everything was printed from my computer using my paper and ink, on my time, at home — in many cases years before Alchemy even existed,” he said.

“Alchemy has no claim to it whatsoever.”

Swann said the book would “come and go” with him and was not kept at Alchemy.

He said in his reply that he quit on April 10, 2021, for “breach of contract.” He alleged Renner refused to pay him as agreed and suggested he skim from tips to make up the difference.

Looking at the government of BC's Wildfire service website [interactive map](https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/f0ac328d88c74d07aa2ee385abe2a41b),  there is a ""fire of note"" about 12-16 km from Knouff lake. Other regions look worse, but that doesn't help in knowing if the Knouff lake area is a good spot to be in the first place.

Would anyone from the region or with more knowledge about wildfire assessment than me (I have none), have any advice?

Also, I couldn't find any government of BC advisories in terms of whether or not they suggest to suspend trips to the Kamloops area. Is there such a thing?

I need all your honest thoughts and opinions (give me the good, bad, and ugly) from those who have lived or are living in Kamloops, particularly on the following topics:

&#x200B;

* Wildfires and smoke - How bad has it been for the past 5 years? Does it make you want to move away? Has it progressively gotten worse or did summer 2021 surprise everyone?
* Are municipalities/governments doing anything to address the issue of wildfires (other than long-term goals of addressing climate change)?
* Real estate (property tax affordability, good neighbourhoods to live, etc.)
* Young families - Can you comment on if there are many/few young families?
* City amenities (schools, parks, nature, rec centres, etc.)
* Other nuances of the city/area that are generally unknown to foreigners

&#x200B;

I know I've asked for a ton of information, if it's too much, I'd appreciate if you could focus on the topic of wildfires, as that one concerns me the most since we have a young child.

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help!

**Background/Profile:**

My in-laws are retiring and have put an offer on an acreage in Pritchard. Naturally, my wife wants to live near her parents, considering our first is now 7 months old, and we'll likely be trying for a second within a year.

We're both 29 yrs old, and are looking for a family-friendly place to raise our children. Calgary has really good schools and a young population. We love where we are in the city and the amenities, but the winters are damn cold and obviously we would be far from the grandparents.

Being close to work for us is not an issue - I landed a new job in tech which is permanent work from home, and wife will work online as a teacher once her mat leave is over.

We're interested in the Dallas-Barnhartvale area as it is closer to Pritchard.",Kamloops,Opinions on living in Kamloops - Potentially moving from Calgary,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamloops/comments/qwfnxg/opinions_on_living_in_kamloops_potentially_moving/

What are they doing to make people stay?... the music was good.. the food tables under tents were full of people not eating and getting out of the sun.. ( I would do the same ) the lines at the vendors were stupid.really... this has been going on for years and they still have 30 plus minute lines and 1 point of sale.?? 
I have been to fests where they put up sun shades and misters for people in lines..  that did not happen.
Prarie smoke has a line on the right that was the cash line!! It looked like a pick up line, and after 10 minutes roasting my ass in the sun a guy comes along to tell everyone it is a cash line!! ( no sign..etc.). And the Karen two in front of me when I switched over to that line only had a debit and they hooked her up. A solid 3/10 effort!!    So.. the food... Was stellar!!  45 bucks will feed two skinny people .. great ribs and pulled pork, moist, tender and an overly sweet sauce but nice ribs, with solid smoke.
We got in line at smoke dem bones and as we got close to the front a guy behind us made a joke about them running out.....  !  Sure enough they came out and said ribs were almost sold out!!  Two people in line behind us were able to get ribs...  we watched the 4 guys on that grill line looking like they had gone 5 with Mike Tyson.. totally facing the sun all afternoon, sunburnt and tired as fuck. And hats off boys 👍. The cash counter... Not so much
They shorted our rib order.. shorted our ""half chicken""

 and the brisket.. was fucking shite.  

They must have came up short and literally bought bag brisket from Costco or Superstore... Utter garbage.  I could have microwaved  superstore brisket and been as happy.
We all fall down right?  They had the best fuckin baked beans I have had in years.. worth the line just for those. I have never had as good outside the southwest states...   Corn brean was fine if you are not at risk of diabetes.

City of Kamloops really half assed the event....  They had  1 station for people to refill water bottles.. jack shite for children at the event and no effort made for cooling/ misting or shade stations. Other than the ""food tables"" 
It is damn hot out and they could have been doing education about sun / heat awareness and instead they had fat muppets driving around in ATVs on pedestrian paths beeping at families with small kids... 

Went for a beer at Red Collar after we pulled out with 3 little boxes of food ($90 ) and had a beer...
Damn!! I love Red Collar and the frosty AC and beer!

Food was fine..lines were silly... Bring cash.

Hoping to hear from folks who have purchased an apartment or townhouse while owning pets in Kamloops? I have two cats and it seems exceedingly difficult to find pet-friendly stratas (two cats or two dogs, I know bylaw won't allow for more), and when I do find one it's usually only one cat or one dog with approval. A lot of listings won't have info on if pets are allowed too - in this case is it acceptable to message the listing realtor to ask? I don't have a realtor yet, while I know they're there to assist in the search in general, I don't want to waste their time when I don't have a specific listing I'm interested in. Also, when listings say ""some restrictions"" regarding pets, does that generally mean a weight limit? 

Please be kind - I'd do anything before rehoming either of them. I know renting is just as/more difficult with pets.

#What is it?#
It's a collection of chat rooms specifically for BC folk who want a little more *social* in their social lives.

#How's it work?#
Click [the link](https://discord.gg/qPMj39RFrg), say hi, and start meeting new friends.  You can run Discord either in your browser or download and install the application to your computer / phone.  Completely free and pretty darn easy.

The server is divided into chat rooms based on topics of interest, like #videogames, #food-n-cooking, and #hockey, etc.  There's even the age-restricted #adults-only room for those who like that sort of thing.  :)  Drop into the rooms that interest you and meet others in your area with the same interests.  There's something for everyone, but in case there isn't, stop by the #suggestions room and propose a new topic!

#Why?  What's the point?#

Every week or so there's another post in one of the BC subreddits saying something like ""How do you make friends here?"" or ""Hi, I'm new, looking for friends!""  I've moved more than 15 times across three countries and this is a situation that I've been in many times myself.  Everywhere I went, to make friends I started looking for groups to join or, if there were no groups, I started them myself.  That that's what this is, a first step to bring people together around common interests to help people be social and maybe make a few new friends.
