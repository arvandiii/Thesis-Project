I know it's kind like a mission impossible, but I still wanna try my luck to see if any one can get me the plate number of this 2002-2005ish red Subaru Forester. The driver is a white smoking female, with a guy who has lots of beards. She hit my car on May 8th around 12:00 at CIBC Kingsway and Knight parking lot. My insurance deductible is $750, it will help alot if I can give at least partial of her plate number to ICBC. Or, if you by any chance saw this Forester somewhere on the street, please also write down the plate number.

Please help me if you can,

Much appreciated.

This sub seems to have been made to get away from, and to keep ""bad"" users out of r/Vancouver. Makes sense, right?

Posts removed without explanation, same with comments, tons of alt accounts that are many years old with low karma come in to brigade and downvote, which I though was against reddits rules, limits on topics and posts allowed here, again no reason for that.

Also, mentioning other subs isn't against sitewide rules. Saying other subs have good/bad mods also isn't a rule breaker. If it were there'd be tons of posts deleted every day.
