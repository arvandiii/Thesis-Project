They used it for residential and industrial traffic as well as bikes mountain and motor. 
So the road failed, that meaning that the low side or river side slid and eroded from rain fall and improper stabilization. It happens, I get it. 
What I don’t understand is the city’s complete disregard for the need for this artery for the Gariabaldi highlands. What I don’t understand is… 
-Why the Boulevard become a haul road for 40-75 ton loads of rock and fill material… 
-Why has there been 0 attempt to fix or even stabilize the section of road. 
-With the equipment(excavators), trucks and material(rock/fill) close by is no one on city council able to put these things together and make something happen?
-Why the residents of the Boulevard have come to accept this. Can you imagine loaded and empty dump trucks coming by your door every 3-5 mins? 

What needs to happen to force change? Probably a major event, an event causing a mass evacuation of the Highlands like maybe a wildfire. Completely plausible situation and after last years summer of 40C + weather. It’s not if but when? 
So when you think of how many people and families live up here, how if all were told you gotta leave now. How grossly inadequate using 2 two lane roads would be. Me personally I was evacuated for the Fort McMurray fire. It was chaos, it took over 2 1/2hrs to travel a distance under a 1 km.

Squamish's first pro-covid superspreader event is apparently taking place at Junction Park downtown on Saturday May 22 and will include a car rally up from Vancouver and one down from Pemby. They have claimed to have musicians lined up to play. 

https://www.facebook.com/Sea-to-Sky-Freedom-Protestival-109126454300805/

I can't be sure exactly who is organizing it, but it looks like someone named Lani Gelera is mentioned a bunch on their FB page as well as some groups affiliated with the FB group ""Sea to Sky Freedom Thinkers"" (a pro-covid group) which itself is/was run by a local person who identifies as a Sovereign Citizen. When I posted about this previously, this group was private but viewable (including the admins and a banner pic), but since that post they've either deleted the group or hidden it. The Sovereign Citizen link shouldn't be a surprise to those who keep up with the anti-mask movement and its deep ties to extremist + other conspiracy groups.

Since I initially posted about this (and deleted the post), a discussion sprang up on FB tire-fire group Squamish Speaks where numerous members claimed to have reported the event to the cops and the District. There's no way to know what effect that might have. It may be up to us to protect ourselves and our community. Find ways to peacefully and safely disrupt the event. Keep each other and our vulnerable community members safe.

It's fun and easy to dismiss these absolute death-worshipping shit-eating crackpots as just that, but it's not a bad idea to have some background to their ""ideas"" (lol).

My own half-baked analysis (consume with a grain of salt):

There's a segment of social conservatives (PPC, Rebel Media, etc) who see everything to do with Covid (the virus, the illness, restrictions, mitigation measures, vaccines, the works) as a liberal/left cultural project. Taking any aspect of it seriously or participating in it in any way is seen as giving power to left/libtards/trudeau/woke etc. We all have those FB friends who talk about Trudeau's ""treason"" (code for them wanting him dead), these are some of the folks I'm talking about. Also, as with so many conspiracy movements, scratch just a little beneath the surface and we find the familiar stench of anti-semitism. Look up Sartre's quote on dealing with anti-semites, it applies to antivaxxers as well.

#What is it?#
It's a collection of chat rooms specifically for BC folk who want a little more *social* in their social lives.

#How's it work?#
Click [the link](https://discord.gg/qPMj39RFrg), say hi, and start meeting new friends.  You can run Discord either in your browser or download and install the application to your computer / phone.  Completely free and pretty darn easy.

The server is divided into chat rooms based on topics of interest, like #videogames, #food-n-cooking, and #hockey, etc.  There's even the age-restricted #adults-only room for those who like that sort of thing.  :)  Drop into the rooms that interest you and meet others in your area with the same interests.  There's something for everyone, but in case there isn't, stop by the #suggestions room and propose a new topic!

#Why?  What's the point?#

Every week or so there's another post in one of the BC subreddits saying something like ""How do you make friends here?"" or ""Hi, I'm new, looking for friends!""  I've moved more than 15 times across three countries and this is a situation that I've been in many times myself.  Everywhere I went, to make friends I started looking for groups to join or, if there were no groups, I started them myself.  That that's what this is, a first step to bring people together around common interests to help people be social and maybe make a few new friends.
