I am looking for information regarding a fire that happened in fort Nelson sometime between 1997 and 1999. It was in a small building on the property of a motel along the highway. The building had long-term rental units in it. The motel itself was not affected by the fire, but the small building that burned was completely destroyed.

Would you happen to know the name of the motel and/or would you be able to link me to any news related to it?

Thank you for any help you were able to provide.",FortNelson,A fire,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNelson/comments/v12sd8/a_fire/
