I know the housing seems to be crazy this year and just shooting my shot out here if anybody has a spare room for rent or roomate that's leaving or anything like that, I'd love to join a house.

2 weeks ago, my partner and I packed up all our stuff and gave it to a shipping company, while we embarked on a road trip down to Tennessee for the weekend, drove through to Rapid City, South Dakota, stopped in Calgary to pick up our (very unhappy at this point) cats, and finally settled into our new home. Neither one of us has lived in small towns before, both growing up in cities, and my partner's new job has him more well-known than he expected. I'm originally from Newfoundland, and haven't been further west than Ontario, so this whole ""gorgeous mountains everywhere"" thing is going to take getting used to. 

So far, all my social interaction has been with storekeepers, receptionist-types, and/or older ladies who go to church. I see a lot of elderly folk, and families with young children, but where do the 25+ crowd hang out? My partner and I are both into tabletop gaming, currently trying to buy bikes, and hoping to get involved with more outdoor activities. I smoke marijuana, and would love to have some people to chill out with.

Hoping to get some replies. This place is lovely so far!",Revelstoke,"Just moved from hamilton, ontario to revelstoke; anyone around?",0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Revelstoke/comments/4sjtd3/just_moved_from_hamilton_ontario_to_revelstoke/

I see some news articles from the last couple of years stating due to off-leash pets chasing bears they decided to prohibit pets on most of the train in the park.

But what is the current situation? Are animals on leash actually allowed everywhere? How to confirm this? Tried calling the park number but it says due to Covid only automated system is available.
