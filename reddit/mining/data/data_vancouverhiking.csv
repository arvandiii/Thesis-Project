&#x200B;

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the recent closure of public hiking trails and parking facilities in the beautiful town of Lions Bay. As a dedicated outdoor enthusiast and a resident of this area, I am profoundly concerned about the impact this decision is having on our community's access to these natural resources.

&#x200B;

While I understand the importance of safety measures during fire hazards, it has come to my attention that there is currently no imminent fire risk due to favorable cooling conditions in the region. The decision to close these hiking trails and parking areas appears to be unwarranted, especially considering the value these public spaces hold for local residents and visitors alike.

&#x200B;

Moreover, it has become apparent that some residents of Lions Bay have consistently voiced their displeasure about hikers accessing these trails. While I appreciate the concerns of local residents, it is essential to balance the interests of the community with the right of all citizens to enjoy these public amenities. Hiking and outdoor activities are not only a source of physical and mental well-being but also play a crucial role in promoting tourism and economic growth in our region.

&#x200B;

I kindly request your intervention in this matter. As our elected representative, I believe you have the power to advocate for a fair and equitable solution that allows both residents and outdoor enthusiasts to coexist harmoniously. I urge you to work with relevant authorities to reconsider the decision to close these trails and parking areas, ensuring that they remain accessible to the public, especially during times when fire hazards are not a concern.

&#x200B;

Preserving our natural heritage and maintaining the spirit of inclusivity is vital for the well-being of our community. I would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can provide to address this issue and ensure that public hiking trails and parking facilities in Lions Bay remain open for all to enjoy.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your positive response.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

&#x200B;

\[Your Name\]

We were thinking of going to the [E.C. Manning Park](https://bcparks.ca/ec-manning-park/). What are your advice, suggestion and experience? I have some specific questions below. 

Thank you!



* **What is the best place to camp?**

We plan to sleep in a tent, and we like to set up close to the car to be close to our materials and to have a place to warm up in case it is cold. The [Lone Duck One campground](https://www.manningpark.com/camping/) seems to be the best because it has fire pits, woodstove, shelter, and pit toilets. It is first come first served, and it has only 20 tents maximum. Will it be already full if we arrive on Friday April 7 at noon?


From the [pictures on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/spo4JPjdMj9FAVZs6), it seems that people can park the car next to their camping site in the summer, but the snow might not be plowed enough to allow that now.
[Other possible places](https://camping.bcparks.ca/create-booking/results?mapId=-2147483601&searchTabGroupId=2&bookingCategoryId=1&startDate=2023-04-07&endDate=2023-04-10&nights=3&isReserving=true&partySize=1&filterData=%7B%7D&searchTime=2023-04-03T13:27:10.634&equipmentCapacity=1&resourceLocationId=-2147483618) for us could be the Cambie Creek (no fires) and Lone Duck Two group sites. From the BC Parks website, Cambie Creek is not operating on those dates and Lone Duck Two is already full. 

Are there any other places to go?

* **Will we be able to sleep comfortably?**


According to the [Manning Park Resort snow forecast](https://www.manningpark.com/weather-webcams-and-trail-status/), the weather is as follows.
Friday night: Light Snow, 2cm, low -6¬∞C high -3¬∞C, Light Winds
Saturday night: Snow Shwrs, low -4¬∞C high -3¬∞C, Light Winds
Checking on the [webcam](https://www.manningpark.com/weather-webcams-and-trail-status/) of the Skyview Campground, there is snow on the ground.


Our setup and sleeping system is as follows. We will put a [camping tarp](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0748FG2Z6?) on the ground. Our tent is the Bugaboo Mountain Equipment Olympus 2, it‚Äôs a large 2-people tent with a bottom tarp and a roof cover layer. We will put a [foam insulating pad](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00FB6D0YG?) under the mattress to give us some R-value and act as a sleeping pad. The mattress is the [Intex Dura-Beam Plus twin-size air mattress](https://www.amazon.ca/Intex-Dura-Beam-Standard-Internal-Electric/dp/B0869FL812/). It‚Äôs not made for winter camping so it probably doesn‚Äôt contribute much to the R-value. We place a quilt on the mattress and cover the sides to prevent cold air from creeping up.

Our sleeping bags are the mummy-style Eureka Azalea (-9¬∞C) and the Eureka Women‚Äôs Casper (-9¬∞C). We have another rectangular sleeping bag (-5¬∞C) that we will use as a quilt, plus one small additional quilt. On the side of the bed, we will put a thick yoga mat to insulate the ground. I ordered a [tent-liner](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0752D7BWM?) but it will not arrive in time.

I tested the sleeping system at 3¬∞C with no tarp, no foam pad, only the air mattress and -5¬∞C rectangular sleeping bag and quilts, it was comfortable.


Is it better to always put back the tent and mattress in the car during the day or is it possible to leave the set-up in place?

Will our system be warm enough for sleeping comfortably, and the tent protect us against the wind?

* **After the hiking, what is the optimal way to warm up?**


After the snowshoeing hike, probably we will be wet from exercise. In order to warm up quickly, probably we would change to dry clothes, jump in the car and use heating. We can go to the shelter on the campground, or make a fire. We can even drive to the downhill ski resort. Would it be a good idea to get something like a heated blanket that plugs in the car? Or any other tricks to warm up quickly and be comfortable at camp?

* **What should we do with our damp clothing, gear and footwear? Will it be able to dry?**

Probably, our base layers as well as jackets, snow pants, and footwear will be wet possibly soaked. My wife suggested that we bring at least 1 set of base layers for each day. I can also bring two pairs of boots.

I am wondering if people have a good way of drying gear, especially for longer trips. My layers are mostly quick-dry polyester. What are the best way to dry clothes and footwear?

* **Where to hike?**


My wife enjoys spectacular views, and I enjoy long hikes. We have some experience in winter hiking and snowshoeing and we are intermediate level.

We probably will do 1-2 short day hikes and 1-2 long day hikes, if everything goes well we would stay for 3-4 days, 3 nights. I was thinking to bring our downhill skiing equipment in case the weather is not so great we can substitute a snowshoeing hike for skiing.


For the short hikes, I‚Äôm mostly interested in the [Lightning Lake loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/lightning-lake-loop
) (8.5km, 206m) that could be extended to the [Flash](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/lightning-lakes-loop) or [Strike](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/strike-lake-camp-via-lightning-lakes-chain-trail-7bcbf83) Lakes; the [Memaloose Peak](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/memaloose-peak) (13.8km, 811m); and the [Grassy, Bojo, Mara loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/canada/british-columbia/grassy-bojo-and-mara) (14.5km, 873m) but we would probably skip Mara.


For the long hikes, I‚Äôm interested in [Windy Joe Mountain](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/windy-joe) (15.4km, 1105m), and [Frosty Mountain West Summit](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/canada/british-columbia/frosty-mountain-west-summit) (14.3, 1280m), or maybe [Snow Camp](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/snow-camp-manning) (17.1km, 911m).


Some other options that I saw on AllTrails are [Mt Kelly](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/mount-kelly-trail?) (7.4km, 570m), [Burnt Knoll](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/canada/british-columbia/burnt-knoll-via-fat-dog-trail) (14.5km, 690m), [Fat Dog](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/fat-dog-trail) (14.8km, 697m), [Frosty Mountain East Summit](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/frosty-mountain-trail) (21.2km, 1220).

* **What would be a good backup plan?**


When we arrive, if we see that the camping site seems too cold, we will just do one day hike and drive back home.

If we are not comfortable sleeping there, we can go to another location within Southwestern BC and spend the remaining of the time there. As a backup plan, we could go to [Mamquam River Campground](https://mamquamrivercampground.ca) in Squamish for camping, and do the snowshoeing in the Whistler area.

The trail itself is a gradual ascent on an old road all the way to the fire lookout. The trail was well maintained and pretty much all of the blowdown had been cleared along the way. It took us about 3 hours up and 2 hours down (650m gain and loss over 15km). The heat was no joke‚Äîin hindsight we could packed some more electrolytes, and if our timing was better‚Äîstarted hiking much earlier in the day. We both felt the effects of heat exhaustion.

The next day I decided to knock Frosty off my bucket list as a solo hike/run. I started earlier at about 9am to try to beat the afternoon heat. It took about 3 hours up and 2 1/2 down (1250m gain and loss over 21km). The heat was absolutely brutal (about 34-35c for most of the day).

Hike 1 - Friday 15th Oct. - West Knob via Nelson Creek trail

[https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/west-knob-via-nelson-creek-trail?p=41383144](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/west-knob-via-nelson-creek-trail?p=41383144)

11.4km -  667m up

\- Nice gentle start with a fairly steep section towards the end, up to the lookout. The steepest bit is after you pass the turning onto the Baden Powell trail

\- This felt a bit like the Norovan falls hike but steeper and more interesting.

\- It was extremely wet but most of the trail is forest covered so you are sheltered from the wind. 

\- The trail is quite rooty/rocky which lead to quite slippery conditions.

\- In the  middle third of the ascent, you find yourself walking on the edges, and through the middle of a stream. Nothing sketchy but waterproof footwear a must.

\- Plenty of misted forest to be seen from the west knob lookout but nothing in the way of the ocean or Bowen Island. Total greyout

\- Cold and a bit blustery at the top.

\- No snow or ice.

\- Coming down the top third, I found a hiking pole very useful. Perhaps I wasn't used to the new heel on my boots -- felt like i was leaning over a lot.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------

Hike 2 - Saturday 16th Oct. - Black mountain loop from the Cypress parking lot

[https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/black-mountain-and-cabin-lake#:\~:text=Black%20Mountain%20and%20Cabin%20Lake%20is%20a%203.7%20mile%20heavily,must%20be%20kept%20on%20leash](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/british-columbia/black-mountain-and-cabin-lake#:~:text=Black%20Mountain%20and%20Cabin%20Lake%20is%20a%203.7%20mile%20heavily,must%20be%20kept%20on%20leash).

&#x200B;

6km - 360m up

\- A short but very nice hike, and my first introduction to Cypress park proper.

\- The park was empty, we saw a couple of other hikers on this section of trail but most seemed to turn back quite quickly.

\- Two trees (at different locations) were down on Cypress Bowl road, as we drove up the park, blocking around 50% of the road each. These had been cleared when we came back down \~ 2 hours later.

\- I think this day actually had a rain related weather warning. It was incredibly wet, and it shows on the trail. 

\- Gullys on the side of some parts of the trail had burst and the trail was essentially a stream bed -- water was rarely above the boot cuff though. Not dangerous mind, just very very wet, and some slippy rocks to watch for.

\- Some deeper streams feeding/joining the lakes near the top of the trail need to be jumped if you have short legs.

\- Again a complete greyout at the top, nothing to be seen from black mountain. Very windy

\- On the upper half of the trail, there were frequent, but small, patches of slushy snow. I presume there was more, but this heavy rain has washed a lot of it away. I had expected ice but saw none.

\- No facilities beyond bathrooms and a help desk to get maps were open.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------

tl;dr Two short and very wet, but fun hikes. Be prepared to get your feet wet but no trouble with snow or ice yet. Zero views beyond the trees.

**Snowline**: With the heat wave lot's of snow melted quite quickly. Plenty of reports of lot's of snow on the way up to places like Pump Peak. Expect deeper snow on north facing aspects and in shaded areas. 1100-1300m.

**Hazards**: There is still plenty of snow, making good quality footwear with deeper lugs ( the nubbly bits). Microspikes and trekking poles with powder baskets are very handy. Navigation also gets trickier as trails in the snow can be legitimate, or trails created by mistake. 

Heat exhaustion is a risk that is worth being aware of. Bring lot's of water, and sun protection.

**Weather:** Tuesday rains give way to beautiful weather for the next 8 days. Expect warm weather, and clear skies for the weekend as a high pressure system runs through.

**Hazards:**  Snow bridges over creeks, rocks, logs and other features remain hazards. Look for sags in the snow, or depressions that suggest waterflow. Probing with the handle of a trekking pole is a good way to assess if the snow is firm enough to cross. As ever moving in groups is highly recommended.

**Gear**: Microspike should be considered essential. Trekking poles are recommended. For slopes steeper than 30Àö (Blue run on a ski hill) a mountaineering course is recommended to learn how to use the appropriate equipment. Good waterproof jacket and pants are important with the cool weather expected. Gaiters are also a good idea.

This time of year snowshoes are less helpful as the wet heavy snow tends to not work as well with snowshoes. It‚Äôs often about the same effort to posthole ( walk through deep snow with legs dipping down into the snow).

**Recommended Hikes**:

Snow Free - Deeks Lake - Longer hike, with beautiful alpine lake. Fewer open views than other routes, but more time to appreciate the forest, waterfalls and hiking staples. It's a longer route, so leave plenty of time. Hiking poles are good to have the rough rubble road descent.

Multi-day: With Sea to Sky Gondola back open there are numerous good spots to camp in that zone. So I present a challenge. PM me the answers to the quiz bellow and I will recommend a good spot nearby for camping.

Edit: I've had quite a few responses, FYI, so I'll have to start suggesting some other locations for campsite so as not to blow the spot up too much. 

1) What are the seven principles of leave no trace?

 2) what is the controversial 8th principle? 

3) If there are no bear hangs what will you do?

Was at the Cal-Cheak rec site yesterday night and couldn't get a spot by the creek, so we drove up the logging road towards Whistler bungee a short while. There's a turn off that gets you hidden off into the woods, lots of evidence of other campfires here.

We built a fire ring, was using dead wood off the ground and also some dry wood we carried in, had water nearby (also had started raining). About two hours in a man is walking towards us from the road looking pretty pissed, tells us we need a permit to have a fire here and it's really dangerous, and that we need to put it out.

I suspect he might've been the Cal-cheak site operator that was annoyed at having to come out to the smoke to see what was up, but i really thought it was within my rights to have a fire if a ban isn't in effect and I'm following the regulations.  Did i do things right, or was it because of the location that I'm in? I thought i was on crown land.

I disagree, so here is a breakdown of inexpensive ten essentials links:

1. Navigation - Maps can be purchased, or you can print them off [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/print#) for free. FATMAP, AllTrails and Gaia also offer premium plans where you can download PDFs. [Compass with bezel $20](https://vpo.ca/product/309159/a-10-cm-nh-compass),  or [$10.](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/Compass-Navigation-Map-Reading-Scouts-Camping-Hiking-Scale-Ruler-Outdoor-Orienteering-Tools/PRD6I6QYLMWV9OO) But if you don't have training even a cheap one is better than a phone.
2. Sun Protection - Sports Sunscreen $10, Cheap sunglasses or whatever you have.
3. Insulation - Fleece from Value Village $8, A proper $150 rain jacket is a good idea, but even a garbage bag is better than nothing if you don't mind being incredibly uncomfortable.
4. Illumination - [Headlamp for $8](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/certified-lightweight-3-led-pivot-headlamp-0650017p.html#srp), though a [water resistant headlamp](https://www.atmosphere.ca/categories/gear-by-activity/camp-hike/lighting/headlamps/product/petzl-tikkina-250-lumens-headlamp-black-color-333064334_01-333064334.html#333064334=333064347) ($25) is worth splurging for and [rechargeable](https://vpo.ca/product/305487/bindi-headlamp-200-lumens-rechargeable) headlamp can save you money in the long run.
5. Fire - Collect lint from the drier, use hand sanitzer, it all works rather well. $2 lighter. Personally I think this is only a need for overnight and water trips, not dayhikes.
6. Repair - A small piece of duck tape rolled to itself $3
7. Nutrition - This is user dependant. Left overs are fine. You don't need fancy bars. ($5)
8. Hydration - Any old 1L drink bottle, Smart Water being a favourite ($1- 5)
9. First Aid - [$15 Hiking Specific kits](https://vpo.ca/product/272333/ultralight-watertight-5-medical-kit) are the best option, though you can crummy cheap ones for [$6 ones on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Mini-Outdoor-First-Aid-Kit/dp/B08191VWDG/ref=sr_1_51?dchild=1&keywords=First+aid+kit&qid=1612555536&sr=8-51). It's worth investing in a[proper kit](https://escaperoute.ca/products/summer-backcountry-first-aid-kit) and training. But some sterile materials to stop bleeding, and treat minor injuries like cuts, blisters and sprains goes a long way. 
10. Shelter - You can get reflective mylar blankets (space blankets) for $2, but the [$5 SOL Blankets](https://vpo.ca/product/272324/emergency-blanket) are worth splurging for as they are more durable and can be used to make tarps. The [$25 Bivy](https://vpo.ca/product/272323/emergency-bivvy-xl) is even better. If you don't want to get a rain jacket, a [Poncho/Tarp](https://vpo.ca/product/195459/nylon-tarp-poncho) is cheaper than most waterproof jackets $80.

Total Minimum Cost: $70

That does sound expensive. Much of these things might also be lying around your houses, so it's worth seeing what you can use from what you have. Also this is cheaper than one or two big nights out on the Granville strip, and since we can't do that now, it might be a good time to invest.

Some things aren't included like a backpack to put everything in ( doesn't need to be fancy, though proper straps and hipbelt will make your day more pleasant). Carrying a garbage bag in the pack to keep things dry is a good idea.

We tried to check it out to see if it was a rave or just something to see ( the music seemed quite trance like ). When we were getting some what close I‚Äôd say 200ft away but couldn‚Äôt see anyone because the brush was thick we could tell they knew we were around because flash lights started looking for us and I felt like it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to go any closer so we doubled back. We waited on one of trails we some what knew and after about 5 minutes the music changed to a more low Demonic chant and we saw flash lights on the trail maybe 50ft from where we were. So we kept moving out of the forest until we came to a four way path with some moonlight to see. The flash lights followed us and as soon as they saw us the flash lights changed to red light and started slowly moving towards us. At this point I said hey just going for a walk and Shawn my flash light at them. When I did that there flash lights went out and I could just see moving feet because the smoke ( must have been 10-15 people ).

My best friend and I are planning a trip out west for this September and were looking into hikes in Vancouver. Wanna see some of that beautiful green and blue lakes. We will have a car and are planning on going to Garibaldi Lake for our hike and overnight camping. We will be sleeping in hammocks. I had a few questions for you fine folks here I hope you can help with.

1. Do you recommend any specific campsite? I was looking at Garibaldi Lake, Taylor Meadows, Cheakamus lake or possibly Wedgemount? Not sure which is best for hammocks and a view.
2. Will it be cold overnight? I saw we can't have fires so trying to gage what to pack
3. Is the Panorama Ridge THAT much further? we hike and camp semi often here at home but the hikes definitely aren't up mountains. 1-10 rating of toughness?
4. Best way to get clean water ? Natural springs, tabs, boil, etc.
5. any other tips?

EDIT: 
Since we are three city stop, we are not bringing a tent. That seems to rule out Garibaldi. Do you have any tips on where to camp in an Eno hammock? We have a car so we can drive anywhere in Vancouver, would really just like to see one of your beautiful lakes!!

After lots of research and some recon trips my partner and I started the traverse at Mount Seymour on Sunday, August 8th. We decided to go with a modified route, avoiding Bear Claw ridge and a long road walk by crossing Indian Arm at low tide.

TLDR: In general the route, wouldn‚Äôt call it a trail, lived up to its reputation of being a beast. It was mentally and physically exhausting but because of the decent flagging it was doable. Without the flagging it would take forever and be too risky IMO. Water was a huge issue. It was hard to know when our next source would be and sometimes it was a very gross old tarn. If the trail had a bit more work done to it I think it could be a great thru hike for experienced hikers who don‚Äôt mind bushwhacking.

Day 1 - half day - had a late noon start from cloudy Mt Seymour. It wasn‚Äôt necessary but we decided to bag Mt Seymour on our way. No views but also no bugs. We hiked to the top of Mt Elsay to camp, hoping to get some views the next day as weather was supposed to be better.

Day 2 - Mt Elsay to just past Presbyter Peak on the Fannin Range. Extremely well flagged and taken care of trail. A good amount of up and down but probably the easiest terrain of the trip. Weather had called for sun but we were still in the clouds for most of the day.

Day 3 - Presbyter to Dickens with a nice stop at Fannin Lake. The trail down to Fannin Lake is tough, a lot of bushwhacking and the flagging was not great through certain parts. Once you leave Fannin the flagging and trail is much better. Weather was great, somehow the bugs were not that bad. I had heard Dickens referred to No View Dickens, but was pleasantly surprised at how nice the views were.

Day 4 - Down Dickens to cross Indian Arm and then up to Grand Creek. The trail down Dickens to Indian Arm was hard. It‚Äôs very steep, it felt like it was never ending, but in most parts the flagging is decent. We were able to cross the Arm at low tide. My partner could easily walk with their pack and the water was just under waist deep. I am very short so we used our sleeping pads to ferry my pack across two small channels. We went for a well earned dip in the ocean and headed up to Grand Creek, to hang out in the water fall pools, my favourite day on the trail for sure.

Day 5 - Grand Creek to half way to the Dilly Dally trail. Hardest day on the trail and it was the hottest. This was consistent [BW4-BW5 bushwhacking](https://www.summitpost.org/phpBB3/bushwhacking-ratings-t48102.html), moving at less than 1km an hour. There was some exposure, if I did it again I would bring some rope. Gloves, hat, long sleeves and pants required, eye protection recommended. There was flagging but at some parts, especially the peaks, it was harder to find. If you went off route you could easily go off a cliff. Great views, but so much up and down over unnamed peaks.

Day 6 - Half way to Dilly Dally to Buntzen to finish. Another tough day and this time with heat and smoke. The terrain certainly got better as we got closer to Bunzten but there were still some really slow parts with exposure. We had hoped to finish with Mt Beautiful & Eagle Ridge, out Halvor Lunden but due to the smoke and it taking longer than expected we finished with Dilly Dally and what felt like the longest road walk out to finish.

Celebrated by drinking so much cold water, and then some A&W    :)

1) Do not blast your music while you hike. It's fucking rude and inconsiderate. I don't advise using earbuds or headphones, but if you really need music to motivate you on your hike please do that. The blasting from your phone or Bluetooth speaker is not cool, leave the urban sounds at home and enjoy the music nature makes. If you really need the music then perhaps hiking isn't really the hobby for you. 

2) Tissues do not decompose as fast as you think. Stop chucking them on the side of the trail. Pack out what you pack in, that includes tissues (and yes, toilet paper. If you must leave it, bury it!!!) the amount of tissues on the Diez Vistas trail was disgusting and they were right there, just tossed on the side.  

3) Be polite and make way for hikers coming in your opposite direction. Hiking two abreast and not transitioning to single file as other hikers approach is rude as fuck. This happens more on the busier trails but it still needs to be said. Also, be considerate to other moving faster than you, just step aside. 

4) Dog poo bags, but that has been mentioned in a previous post. Pack out what you pack in. That means the dog poo bag. 

5) Smoking cigarettes on trails. I do understand addictions, as my dad is a life long smoker but he also doesn't hike. Smoking on trails is pretty fucking gross and the smell lingers a lot longer than the smoker realizes. Really ruins the fresh air and the filter does not decompose, it just sits there. If you really must have a cigarette while hiking, move to the side, away from the main trail, and pack that butt out with you!!!

There are a lot of other things I could mention that many would find nit picky but seasoned hikers would agree with. These are the most glaring ""infractions"" I've been encountering and I feel they are worse than ever.

Playtu lets you find people to do those thing you love with. Oppenents, teammates, training and adventure buddies.   


I spent 2 years developing Playtu, soft launched in Whistler and launched here in Vancouver in Feb of last year... needless to say its been put on hold but now that our restrictions are lifting I am starting to promote Playtu again.   


With 5000 downloads in a month last year, I am hoping to continue the growth.  I am an old ski bum that had an idea, with no corporate backing and just my own money and time I am hoping that it lets people go out and do the things they love and missed so much over the last year +

Sunday afternoon heavy rain looks likely. Avoid being in the snow in these conditions. Except icy slopes on snow in the alpine early in the day. Microspikes are a good idea at very least. Avoid steeper slopes which require mountaineering training and equipment. 

**Snow Line:**  900 -1000m still. This will likely be the case for at least another couple of weeks given the depth of snowpack. Microspikes recommended. There was fresh now at higher elevations this week. 

**Avalanche/Snow**:  Avalanche Canada's Spring Conditions page is essential reading if you are going above the snow line. Plenty of trails can be navigated safely without safety gear ( except perhaps microspikes and trekking poles).

**We are still likely at least a month and a half away from any summer hiking conditions in the low alpine.**

**Travel Advisories:** Until the May long weekend  travel restrictions are in place for local health areas. Roadblocks are in place. While not legally binding, the communities of Squamish, Whistler, and Pemberton are imploring people not visit even for day trips. Responsible outdoor use means respecting others, especially since these are the communities that maintain the trails, and enable recreation. Respect their work please. Besides, a quick browse of the Bagger Challenge should demonstrate there is a lifetime of great objectives in our own backyard.

Eagle Lake, Cedar Falls, Tunnel Bluffs ( From Lions Bay)

**Weather**: So far it looks like a very rainy friday leading into a mostly clear, and cool friday. Those heading into the alpine should be aware that the rain will have made the snow less stable, and could make for tricky travel. 

**Avalanche**: It's full spring conditions. Which means start early and end early. In the morning travel could be icy and solid requiring microspikes. In the afternoon the snow will get slushy and deep. This means postholing, and awkward steps. Snowshoes don't really help in my experience. You can read more on [avalanche.ca](https://avalanche.ca) about [how to plan and move in spring conditions](https://avalanche.ca/spring-conditions).

**Travel Restrictions:** At present travel restrictions are in place and you are not allowed to [leave your health authority](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/travel/current). [Squamish, Whistler and Pemberton municipalities have all asked people not to visit even for day trips temporarily](https://www.squamishchief.com/coronavirus-covid-19-local-news/dont-come-to-squamish-unless-it-is-essential-local-governments-3661044) (Unlike the health orders this is a request, not a legally binding order). While this is annoying, we should respect the wishes of these communities. Those of us in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland are incredibly lucky to have a life times worth of hiking on our doorstep, so consider staying local.

**Weather:** Warm weather will turn into drizzle and lot's of cloud cover this weekend. Temperatures will drop, with chances of overnight freeze. If you're **heading up to snowline** **microspikes are essentials.** 

**Avalanche:** Risk is Considerable at all elevations until Thursday, and likely into the weekend. The reason is we have seen several large natural avalanches, and human triggered. The drizzle could also trigger large very dangerous avalanches at any time of day. Stay well clear of any overhead cornices or hazards. 

**Travel Restrictions**: The new travel restrictions are pretty tight. Technically anything east of Burnaby should only be adventuring on Coquitlam Mountains. Vancouver should only be exploring North Shore Mountains. Despite being in the same health authority recommendations against non essential travel remain for Whistler, Sunshine Coast and Bowen Island.

With increasingly warm conditions this may rise to 600-700m where the snowpack is much thicker. This means all mountain hikes on Cypress, and Seymour are still snow covered. They will llikely remain snow covered until late May at the earliest. 

Avalanches: This past weekend numerous avalanches and close calls were reported. The fresh snow and warmth. Avalanches [in trees](https://avalanche.ca/?panel=mountain-information-network-submissions/a5296740-9a73-11eb-81e7-36ed4215663e), and open slopes were reported. The avalanche risk is going up to considerable in the alpine. Cornice failures, sun affected slopes and wind slabs all remain key issues. Travel in the alpine should be restricted to experienced and trained parties travelling early in the morning, and finishing early in the day. 

Weather: Saturday looks like an amazing day with temperatures rising to 15ÀöC in the alpine. Rain is expect to arrive Sunday night, Monday morning. This new front could create challenging conditions as heavy snow and rain are extremely challenging to move in. Be conservative and head home early if the weather looks to be arriving earlier than expected. This will also mean a high risk of natural avalanches.
