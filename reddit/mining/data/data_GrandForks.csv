Staying overnight. We've passed through many times before to get to Minneapolis, but we're not familiar with anything here.

We have some of tonight and all of Saturday to do stuff in Grand Forks.

From the past posts on this Reddit, I've gathered names of seemingly interesting places to check out with respect to food and beer, namely 

\-Parrot's Cay Tavern(good wings?), 

\-The Toasted Frog(want to try frog legs & reviews point to it), 

\-Half Brothers(good beer?), 

\-Up North(interesting pizza?), 

\-Casa Mexico(I like mexican food), 

\-Brick and Barley(what's good about it?), 

\-Shing Ya(I like sushi/etc), 

\-Italian Moon(good meal?)

We like finding little places with a unique feel, and try to stay away from either high end($$$) or chain/very commercialized stuff (I gather there's a lot of that near the mall.). Any extra recommendations? 

Also, we are going to buy alcohol. Is it mostly the same, or are there some preferred stores?

&#x200B;

With respect to non-food activities:

I've figured out that the University's rock climbing wall is closed on Saturdays, and that we're 2 weeks too early and a day too early for HollyDazzle(Nov 25)...

Apparently shopping/walking downtown is nice and so is the riverfront, will likely check it out.

I'm wondering if the [ice rink](https://www.downtowngrandforks.org/ice-rink/) is currently in place? There are no dates on the downtown website.

Are there any other indoor activity facilities, like archery, or whatever, really?

If we wanted to go for a pedicure, what's a good place? (assuming it's not too late to get in)

Music-wise, any local bands or good spots to check out? Even if they're not playing, I'd still be interested to get names.

Thought about checking out the play at the Fire Station Theatre, but we'll probably be leaving for Winnipeg before that time.

Art Galleries aren't really our thing.

The [https://www.visitgrandforks.com/](https://www.visitgrandforks.com/) website was quite helpful to help brainstorm.

Thanks!
