Just this morning my fiancé and I had to cancel our wedding for the 31st in the interior due to the fires. We're obviously pretty bummed about this, but we still wanted to get married on the 31st and do something very small locally.  


We're just looking for small spaces (around 30 people) or even parks that we could go to for a quick ceremony in or around Vancouver. If anyone knows of any potential spaces around the lower mainland that they would recommend it would be helpful. Also looking for any recommendations for a local officiant to help with our last minute change in plans.

Thanks in advance from a stressed engaged couple

Contractor and everyone I spoke too said this is shocking and extremely rare, spoke to residents who are concerned as well as this could be a fire hazard. Has ANYBODY dealt with a similar situation? What is the approach here? Emailed the developer and strata has been notified but feeling extremely anxious to get this rectified. If this is a building code violation, who is liable?

We have no idea if a channel has been drilled in the concrete or not for ventilation. Balcony shows there are two vents.

It does sound like this is not in compliance with the BC Building Code. Do violations like these get taken seriously if reported? I believe the channel is to report with our City (City of Richmond).

TLDR: We have a terrible shortage of housing, especially affordable housing. The province has agreed to build three non-market rental buildings in False Creek North, including two high-rises, with a total of 650 apartments. The city still needs to say yes. There's a public hearing Thursday afternoon, and there’s significant opposition (27 comments opposed, 3 in support). If you'd like to counterbalance the opposition (or if you're also opposed!), it takes literally 60 seconds to [submit a comment](https://vancouver.ca/your-government/contact-council-public-hearing.aspx). It can be as simple as ""I support this plan."" Just set the Subject to ""False Creek North Non-Market Housing.""

&#x200B;

[Non-market housing is planned for sites 3, 4, and 5](https://preview.redd.it/74qqp7xoqjbb1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=054d0af5af81e16645246abdfa2a17b5c52aa13c)

When False Creek North (the former Expo Lands) was being planned for redevelopment, the goal was always to have it be mixed-income, with 20% non-market homes. Over the last two or three decades there's been 540 non-market homes built (I think a bit less than half of the target), but there were long delays in getting anything else built.

The city of Vancouver announced in February that it had reached an agreement with Concord Pacific to acquire three sites in False Creek North for non-market housing, between Granville Bridge and Cambie Bridge. BC Housing will build a 28-storey building, a 29-storey building, and a seven-storey building, all with non-market housing. The proposal also includes a new fire hall and a daycare. There'll be a total of about 650 homes.

You sometimes hear housing skeptics say, ""We don't need more housing, we need more *affordable* housing."" They're wrong (we need both!), but it's certainly true that there’s a huge shortage of housing that’s affordable to people with regular jobs.

There's limits to how much non-market housing you can build, because unlike market housing, it requires public subsidy (typically contributions of land or capital). But when there's an opportunity to get 650 non-market homes built, with construction fully funded by the province, it seems like a good idea to take it.

The target is that 30% will be ""low end of market"" (helping to cross-subsidize the lower-income apartments, but run on a non-profit basis), 50% will be lower-income (household income below a certain threshold), and 20% will be ""deeply affordable"" (shelter/pension rate). The lower-income thresholds are: annual household income of up to $58,000 for a 1BR or studio, $72,000 for 2BR, $86,000 for 3BR. 25% of the apartments will be 2BR or 3BR, so suitable for families. 

Because these are non-market rather than market, I expect there’ll be an application process to apply for them. (For an example of what this might look like, see the application process for [Catalyst Community Development’s rental buildings](https://catalystcommdev.org/rent-with-us/).) But for renters (more than half of Vancouverites), this helps even if you’re not living there yourself: when there’s 650 renter households who are living in non-market rentals, that’s 650 fewer households competing for market rentals. When we’re trying to drive up the vacancy rate, everything helps.

Thing is, **non-market housing runs into exactly the same obstacles as market housing**. The city’s zoning is quite restrictive, and actually allowing BC Housing to build these projects requires the city to change its laws. So there’s been several months of public consultation, and now a rezoning hearing Thursday afternoon. It looks like there’ll be a fair amount of opposition.

Confusingly, the city’s term for non-market housing aimed at lower-income households is “social housing,” but it also has an entirely separate category for “supportive housing,” i.e. housing for people who are homeless or destitute. This is non-market, mixed-income housing, not supportive housing. Reading through the comments from opponents, a lot of people talk about “increased criminal burden.” I think they’re imagining that this will be supportive housing.

Comments from opponents:

* I'm concerned my view of False Creek will be blocked, and feel that the space could be better used as a park. 
* The initial plan to build 8 storey buildings was what drove us to buy at 930 Cambie Street. This updated plan is jeopardizing the value of our condo and obliterating the views of False Creek we currently enjoy. This change of plan is unacceptable. 
* An excessively large development could lead to overcrowding, increased traffic congestion, limited parking spaces, and decreased privacy for residents. Such negative impacts would compromise the character and charm of our community, potentially diminishing property values and causing distress to current homeowners.
* This project will obviously damage Yaletown and increase the criminal burden of our communities!
* Social housing needs to be balanced with market housing to integrate all members of society, to ensure integration, diversity and safety. Having 2 large high rises concentrated in one small area risks creating an area that is no longer safe for tourists on the False Creek walkway, children and families in Cooper's Park.

Teams of police responsible for forced relocations of homeless from encampments into housing, with enrollment into treatment and mental health options.
- Big spend on public education of what help, treatment and accompanied incentives are available and how to enroll. Public awareness campaigns for teaching drug use side effects - aimed mostly at youth, to possibly dissuade them from starting (this seemed to work for tobacco smoking, and most recently alcohol).

The compassionate part of me hates a lot of this list, but the rational part of me thinks it’s needed. Thoughts?

I should add, that I view the drug crisis homeless and the un-addicted homeless as somewhat separate populations with different solutions. For both groups, I think the government needs to have Roosevelt-level public works spending to train the working class unemployed to build massive infrastructure to address flooding/forest fire/climate change. Heck the rich folks of Vancouver will gladly fork over their tax dollars for training a million forest fire fighters alone, and these jobs will be in every city and town across BC!",vancouver,Vancouver’s Drug Crisis - some possible solutions,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/14pxabm/vancouvers_drug_crisis_some_possible_solutions/

We live in a ground-floor apartment in Mount Pleasant and we're worried about criminals invading our balconies and inside our units. Our neighbors were robbed recently overnight.

Another neighbor has to deal with people constantly invading her balcony and trying to rob her house. She put a security camera on, but what else to do? We also had another crazy person banging on our balcony door at 1 am claiming to be ""on fire"". The police doesn't do much when we call, in fact, they complained when my neighbor called them last time. 

What to do? I don't want to feel unsafe in my own home. I'm almost considering ""home-alone"" the balcony at night. If the criminals manage to get inside while we're in, is it okay to bear spray?

I think I speak for literally everyone when I say we do not want yet another year of out of control wildfires. It's inevitable that we'll get some that won't be human caused, but it's everyone's duty to be responsible for themselves.

That being said, here are some things you can do to minimize the risk of starting a fire:

* Don't toss cigarette butts out the car window or carelessly onto the ground. If you see your friend do this, PLEASE call them out on it. Be that stick in the mud. Remind everyone you hang out with that it's irresponsible.

* Obey local/provincial fire bans. Look, I know some people really really like bonfires out by the lake or whatever.. but all it takes is one ember to fly off in the wind and land on a patch of dry grass for disaster to strike. Your desire to have a bonfire at the lake does not override nearby residents' right to not have their homes burn down.

* Get familiar with how to use fire extinguishers and carry some with you if you go out RVing/camping. Look up YouTube videos if you need to, ask/show your friends how to do it. It's never a bad idea to familiarize yourself with this invaluable tool.

* Report any dangerous fire activities to authorities. See some drunk college kids being reckless with a bonfire? Call it in. See a fire started by a lightning strike? Call it in. The sooner it's known about, the sooner firefighters can act.

* Know when to use water to put out a fire and when not to. Anyone who's been a cook knows you should never use water to put out a grease fire. Cutting off oxygen is the key, as that is the fuel for most fires. Throw dirt on it, use an extinguisher, or cover the fire with a lid if it's small enough.

I want to enjoy this summer as much as the rest of you do. Please feel free to add more fire safety tips and remember to tell your friends to be responsible.

The email (from the stranger) did not have any back up as to their charges, and the wording sounded very emotional and sensationalized. 

*""Please boycott JJ Bean.  They are being sued in the Supreme Court of BC""*

...but I can’t find such a filing.

  
It went on to describe an:  
*""employee who chews on a toothpick and wears her baseball cap backwards and looks like a pitbull” ""Then she even made him leave.""*

Really? They want to bash a female employee for her style? 

It didn’t explain the situation in which apparently the *“middle eastern man”* was asked to leave, only a bunch of emotional words and a statement that the CEO was evil because they supported his employee. The business apparently has video footage. I’m happy for it to get subpoenaed there and get worked out there instead of trial by on-line emotional rants hurting a BC business.

*""And why is the CEO unwilling to watch the video of the middle-eastern man being (verbally) attacked and slandered by JJ Bean employees?  Does he condone a white-power female attacking a middle-eastern man who chews on a toothpick and wheres a baseball cap BACKWARDS !?!""*

Um...maybe if it’s heading to court they are preparing to show the video there as opposed to responding to unreasonable attacks? The email states that the CEO is *""either a ""proud boy"", or simply a lawless and unprofessional nutjob.  See the Picture attached of him.”* (the photo seems like a nice, smiling normal young guy??)

*""By the way.  Were you aware that in February the JJ Bean Burrard location all of sudden went up in flames?  Many say that is Karma or divine justice.  Picture attached.”* 

They posted “Karma” memes suggesting the business deserves the explosion/fire. That's just mean, imo.

I call bullshit, but interested if anyone knows anything that was clearly not shared in the emotional rant.

Numbers were actually pretty good - along with this, it was a nice mild sunny day so I had my first day this year riding in a t-shirt and shorts, and I saw many others doing the same. A perfect day for CM really. We started off at the art gallery, as usual, and then headed along Hornby towards the Granville bridge, where we stopped for a minute to let everyone catch up and do a chicago bike hold-up. Then we proceeded onto Broadway for a few km, going back on the Cambie bridge, and then after some riding along W Georgia the mass decided to go over the Burrard bridge onto Cornwall Ave, where a 5 year old was seriously injured by a speeding car this past summer. After this, we headed back onto Broadway and ended the ride at Olympic Village, so we did around 30km more or less.

I really liked how the mass decided to focus their attention on routes that had sub-par or non-existent bike infrastructure; biking on Broadway and seeing all the bikes and shops around me without having to worry about being hit by a car was a pretty euphoric feeling. Along with Cornwall Ave, where community members have been advocating for lower speed limits as it passes through pedestrian heavy vibrant neighbourhoods - and of course, again, a 5 year old kid was almost killed by a speeding car while she was standing on the sidewalk.

Overall morale was pretty good, I'd say. Most drivers were very supportive and we got a nice stream of friendly honks going for quite a while. There wasn't really any antagonizing of drivers or starting fights for no reason - everyone was just there to have their voices heard, and to have fun. And yes, we did let road cyclists pass, for the naysayers.

Of course, when you have a big enough mass, you've gotta start corking - and I was one of the corkers for about half of the red lights we passed through. 99% of the time, drivers simply waited patiently for the mass to pass through the intersection, which we were very thankful for. There was only one time where a taxi driver started laying on his horn and yelling, and we simply responded with clapping and positivity. Remember, corking allows the entire mass to clear the intersection faster than if we had split up into multiple groups, and it keeps people safer as cars aren't trying to force their way through the group. If you ever get caught in a CM, please be patient - I'm sure you're able to wait a minute.

There was one time where a fire truck was zoomin down the road and it was almost like Moses parting the sea, the way a hundred people all moved over to the right at the same time in order to clear a lane to let them through. Ironically, because of us, the fire truck most likely made it to its destination quicker than if the street had been filled up with cars all trying to get out of the way.

There were also two times on Broadway where some idiots in luxury SUVs decided to cross the yellow line into *oncoming traffic* in order to pass the mass and there was one instance where they got trapped by an oncoming car and had to sort of force-merge their way back into our lanes. It's very telling where motorists' priorities are when they'll happily wait in rush hour traffic twice a day five days a week, but as soon as they get delayed for 5 minutes by anyone who isn't in a car, they'll start performing dangerous maneuvers and using their vehicle as a weapon to force their way past other people. We're just as entitled to the road as much as they are. When people go ""but you don't need bike lanes on broadway!!11!11"", this is literally a prime example of why we do. Cars and bikes just don't mix well.

It was a great feeling to take back our streets for a few hours. I'm totally headed to next month's ride and I hope to see some of you there as well.",vancouver,Critical Mass Ride Report (April),0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1335uu6/critical_mass_ride_report_april/

Our birds are delightful, hilarious and add a lot to our local communities. They're also nesting right now! If you want to help them out this year, here's a list of things to be aware of that'll make their lives easier.

&#x200B;

* Cats. Cats decimate bird populations. Truly, birds have little chance against even the laziest indoor/outdoor feline (lookin' at you, Earl). Bells do not work very well. Google ""coloured cat collars"" and consider putting one on your cat. Yes, they'll look like an (even more) deranged member of the Insane Clown Posse, but they'll murder less. And less murder is good. Or keep them inside. Just for Spring. They'll live. The birds probably will not.
* Keep dogs on-leash in on-leash areas. Many forest trails, particularly in the North Shore, are on-leash. Birds nest both low and high, and when your dog goes traipsing through bushes they may be unintentionally stomping on bird nests. Their energy freaks birds out, too, so even if your bud didn't step on anything, it might have scared mom so bad that she won't return to her eggs.
* Do not -- ever-- put mouse traps out in the open. You ever see a bird, probably a crow, with a smashed top-beak? Mouse trap. Let's apply some empathy. ""Oh, hey, cool, cheese"" -- SLAM. ""OW! WHY?"" Beak broken forever. It doesn't grow back. Your crow friends laugh at you. You have to sleep on the lower branches and you get pooped on at night. If you must trap your mice, please use a box -- that's what they're for! Open traps are brutal bird killers.
* Put reflective stickers on your windows. Birds smash into them all the time and it's very sad. If they aren't killed outright, often time they're concussed and easy prey (see #1). My partner and I saw a mother Flicker teaching her babies about glass by having them try to fly into it for an afternoon. It blew us away and broke our hearts; they're so much smarter than we think. 
* Clean your feeders and fountains. If you have them, please keep them clean. While we were slammed with COVID, our local birds were slammed with Avian Pox. It was gruesome... We suffer together, truly; clean food and water for them means healthier fledglings. 
* Pause any major yard work such as bush/tree removals until the second half of June. The sun makes us eager to get out there, but jumping in too early with the saw is a sure-fire way of freaking birds out. Naturally, planting local flowers and bushes helps our ecosystems, which benefits the birds.

My personal hate of summer stems from me being bad at regulating heat and when summers were mid to low 20s that was fine but now that 30 degrees is feeling like the norm I am in hell. My 3rd floor apartment has 3 massive west facing windows that absolutely get bathed in sunlight in the afternoon and just cook the hell out of our whole place. We have no sliding windows so the best I can do is get a dual hose AC that underperforms cause I can't properly seal the sliding door it sits in (old 70s ass apartment with shoddy doors) and we got blackout curtains last year that still only helped a bit. During the heat dome my girlfriend and I literally had to just leave the apartment one night cause it was actually unbearable. Heat means fires which means smoke so even if you like going out in the sun and heat odds are it's gonna be brown and hellish so whats the point?? I just spend 3 months sweaty, grumpy, worried about my cat, and unable to escape any oppresive heat. Very few buildings are built to deal with the heat (no AC, good at insulating heat) so it just feels like there is no escape. I can only get so naked and absolutely drenched in wet towels.

Sure winter is dark early and cold but I can bundle up with nice movies or video games and just escape it really easily.

So recently I’ve gotten a job as a Customer Service Fundraiser a fancy word for canvasser and It is a predatory middle man. We go door to door and ask for donations for  the charity’s if you live in a house you probably have had this happen to you. Don’t get me wrong this isn’t a scam more or less but we make commissions on how many monthly donors we can acquire. You need 1 everyday to keep your job and minimum wage and if you get 2 a day u can earn about 20-22$. If you get 12 Monthly donors in 10 Days you can be a team leader and make more money. Why this is a predatory middleman service? We basically knock on doors and persuade you to sign up for a monthly donation we are taught to use emotions and feelings to hook you and will get you invested before we tell you that it is a monthly payment. Don’t get me wrong these charity’s are good causes but you can donate directly to their websites so they receive all of your money. If you do decide to donate monthly through a canvasser the company usually receives half of your donation.
(We have multiple offices and branches so we are profitable) We also have cash incentives to get you to become a monthly donations (thousands of dollars spread out with each top seller) We have 10 days to get 5 donors or we get fired.
So I will be telling you about the charity i’m working and to donate thru the websites until i get fired :)
if you have a job opening thats not as scummy as this that I can interview for let me know.

PLEASE DO NOT BE RUDE TO CANVASSERS
UPPER MANAGEMENT ARE THE LEECHS THEY ARE SELLING YOU A CHARITY( A GOOD CAUSE) AND MAKING MONEY FROM IT THEY MAKE 30+ A HOUR 



most canvassers are immigrants or students who believe in what they are doing raising money for charity’s
If we don’t meet our quota we get fired
this is a job like everything else some are amazing people. 

Tips to send canvassers away.

Put a No Soliciting sign up we will usually not knock

Tell us you are already contributing we will usually thank you 

A simply no I’m not interested saves a lot of time.


If we stop donating to canvassers and donate directly to charities more of our money will be going to a good cause then to someone who is selling u the idea of helping when they are taking most of your money.

We aren’t actually doing your tax forms or anything like that we are just signing you up thru our end so we have proof we signed you up to donate. 

Charity’s that we work with they are good cause and you should donate if you are able to afford it.(Please donate through the website and not thru canvassers)

Looking for advice or tips on current tutoring scene. Current UBC student. Took a break from the tutoring scene during the Pandemic when I was in HS. Looking to get back into it. Any advice on what I should do or who to talk to? Craigslist and Facebook not too helpful atm.

Hey Vancouver,

Hope you're all doing well after all that snow; at least the sun's coming out now. Just wanted to fire this quick post out to ask you all for any advice on what the tutoring scene looks like right now.

For some context, I'm a current UBC Student living in Metro Vancouver, and I was looking to offer my services as a tutor, primarily in Metro Vancouver. I have had 1 year of experience tutoring Math and SAT prep, but I wanted to see if I could start tutoring with people around Vancouver. I just feel it'll be a more fulfilling experience to give back to the community where I have my roots. I'm comfortable teaching almost anything up to High School - anything after that might be a little bit of a stretch (my specialization is Science). I've been looking around on Facebook and Craigslist, but it seems that I haven't received any replies for the past few weeks, nor does it seem like there are any postings that fit my niche. Those who do put out posts are really lowballing it; around $15 an hour or are way out in Maple ridge or Surrey.

Just wanted to get some information from the community on where I should look or who I should talk to; you can probably see I'm still pretty green (went to Uni right after graduation HS). This is NOT AN AD, I haven't really put any of my achievements or anything here, just wanted to learn more about what I can do.

And this mfker is watering his lawn in the early early mornings to avoid getting caught. 

Everyone is doing their part and not watering their lawns so we can have that water for drinking or other essential purposes.

Everyone's lawns are yellow and this guy's is bright green.

Where can I report him anonymously?

Edit: it seems that people are accusing me of wanting to report him after seeing him water a single time. That or they themselves sneakily water their lawns during the wrong days and don't want people reporting them.

The reason I'm reporting him is because:

He waters almost every day. He's an even numbered address so he should only be allowed to water on Saturdays. 

He waters past 7am every day with sprinklers, you're supposed to stop before 7am and only on the allotted days.

And he hasn't just redone his lawn nor has he applied for a water exemption because he is supposed to display the paid permit in the front and he has not.

He is heavily breaking the water restriction laws and we're in the middle of a fking drought. That's why.

I also love everyone's trying to come up with excuses for the watering and the moment I confirm that the neighbor is watering too much and not on the allotted time, everyone just shuts up or resorts to name calling. 

It's clear to me that people are unhappy with me because they probably also water outside the current water restriction rules and don't care about how there's a fking drought going on as long as their lawn looks pretty and green. 

Funny how every time someone breaks rules, this subreddit screams for punishment and turns into discount judge Dredd.

And yet when homeowners are the ones breaking the rules, everyone suddenly acts like it's the fking LA gang streets ""no snitching, snitches get stitches, no one tell on anyone for over-watering.

So I was very surprised to learn that it *did* happen here:

> In 1910, Vancouver became the first large city to cease collecting any taxes on buildings and movable property. Municipal revenue was instead based exclusively on the value of land. ... By 1914, approximately two-thirds of cities in British Columbia, all of Alberta, and one-fourth in Saskatchewan taxed land alone. Most of the remainder of the region taxed land at a higher rate than improvements. [#](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ajes.12218)

Why the enthusiasm for LVT in the early 1900s? There were many reasons but the main one was that cities were competing for new residents:

> Land value taxation spread like wildfire throughout Western Canada as a consensus emerged that it spurred development. In this rapidly developing region, where municipalities were competing for population and investment, the pressure to adopt a more efficient basis of taxation was irresistible. [#](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ajes.12218)

LVT didn't last long as the only tax. Enthusiasm for LVT waned after the world entered a recession and Vancouver's first property bubble burst. In 1918 Vancouver switched to a hybrid of LVT and something similar to today's property tax. 

Over the next several decades, homeowners became an increasingly powerful voting bloc. Tax policy was incrementally changed to be more favourable for them. The changes would:

> ""reduce the relative tax load on vacant land and single-family dwelling groups but would increase the tax load on apartments, industrial and commercial groups” (VCC Minutes 1969). [#](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ajes.12218)

In 1984 LVT was fully eliminated.

This [question](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/small-red-plane-circles-vancouver-harbour-2142133) [comes up](https://scoutmagazine.ca/2020/10/28/big-red-airplane/) [a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/vwm7th/regularly_see_this_red_aircraft_flying_laps/), especially in the summer when everyone's outside and on the water.

We're the [National Aerial Surveillance Program](https://tc.canada.ca/en/programs/national-aerial-surveillance-program), or NASP. We currently have four aircraft: three Dash 8's (based in Ottawa, Moncton and Vancouver), and one Dash 7 (based in Ottawa and Iqaluit).

While we work closely with Coast Guard Environmental Response, we are under the umbrella of Transport Canada.

The plane you see in Vancouver is registration C-GSUR. We launch from YVR airport for patrol missions almost daily, and get overhead Vancouver Harbour several times per week. Our patrol area is the entire BC coast and up to the 200 nautical mile offshore limit of Canada's Exclusive Economic Area. Our patrols usually last 5-6 hours. Rare taskings take us inland to some of the bigger navigable waters of BC, and we deploy up to the Western Arctic to monitor the summer shipping and adventuring traffic.

**What are we doing?**

The NASP's primary mission is to prevent marine pollution in Canada's waters, and when spills do occur we can detect, map, and quantify them to hold the polluters accountable and assist with the mitigation & cleanup effort. Our main focus is the shipping industry, at ports and at anchor inside our waters and in the shipping lanes headed into and out of Canada. Oil spills are really difficult to see from water-level, and really easy to see from the air - we're able to detect and report on spills as small as 0.01L

We have a *lot* of secondary missions. We monitor marine mammal populations, enforce no-boating interim sanctuary areas, report on activity inside Marine Protected Areas, assist with Search and Rescue operations, & monitor and map wildfires, floodwaters and arctic sea ice, to name a few.

**What's on board?**

In addition to our regular crew of 2 pilots and 2 Surveillance Officers, the plane is kitted out with:

* Huge optically-clear windows (above the letter U in the photo) for photos from our onboard DSLR
* MX-15 electro-optic & infrared camera (the grey thing just aft of the nose wheel)
* Side-looking airborne radar (the red tubes under the letters VEILL)  - can see objects 40 nautical miles on either side of the plane, and detect oil \~20 nautical miles on either side
* Infrared & Ultraviolet line scanner (in the black belly pod) - used to map out the entire area of oil with the UV, and the thickest, most recoverable patches with the IR
* Direction finder (in the black belly pod) - can determine which direction radio signals are coming from, to home in on Search and Rescue targets, or just someone with a stuck mic on marine VHF Ch16.

Chris Higgins, Green Buildings Planner, and Brady Faught, Civil Engineer, both with the City of Vancouver's Sustainability Group, will be hosting an **AMA on Monday, Feb 14 from 12:00 - 1:00pm**.

As part of the City’s Climate Emergency Action Plan, staff are actively engaging Vancouver residents on ways to help reduce carbon pollution from Vancouver’s detached houses, and make these homes more resilient to extreme weather events.

Nearly 60 per cent of Vancouver’s carbon pollution comes from burning natural gas to heat buildings and hot water. The city’s 98,000 existing detached houses generate about 30% of these emissions, which contribute to climate change, air pollution, and impacts our health and environment.

The Climate Emergency: Home Heating and Cooling program is seeking feedback from residents on proposed regulations to shift detached homes to renewable energy that produce fewer carbon emissions. 

The regulations being proposed to the public are:

•	That when furnaces and hot water tanks reach their natural end-of-life, they would need to be replaced with more energy efficient equipment, and/or use renewable energy, depending on the size of the detached house; and

•	That major home renovations would require additional energy efficiency improvements.

One example is shifting to electric heat pumps, which use renewable hydroelectricity to both heat and cool a home. Heat pumps are the most energy-efficient system currently available. They significantly reduced emissions and can filter air to reduce respiratory impacts from pollution and wildfire smoke.

The Home Heating and Cooling program also highlights a number of resources and financial supports that are available to assist residents in making these changes, including energy coaching and up to $12,000 in rebates for electric heat pumps.

The City of Vancouver bases its policies on the irrefutable science that climate change is caused by human activities. Debating the reality of climate change is not constructive and takes up valuable time to get to solutions. The City will not respond to questions or comments debating climate science.

There. I said it. We as a city seem to have this weird tendency of rushing to grocery stores and supermarkets and going absolutely nuts, cleaning stuff off the shelves like there's a freaking apocalypse happening. I understand this behaviour when Covid hit, I mean there was (is) a worldwide pandemic wreaking havoc and taking lives left and right. You couldn't leave the house, so sure, that deserves a pass.

But man, time and time again we have seen this repeat itself. Wildfires? People hoarded water bottles. Covid? People hoarded personal protective equipment for resale. Floods? People are back to hoarding toilet paper, eggs and food in general. Heatwave? People hoarded ACs and Fans to sell on craigslist. Double rainbow? Ok, we didn't hoard anything there, good job :). Aurora Borealis? That never came, but I'm sure someone hoarded binoculars.

It just strikes me as odd how we have no sense of community. I was just at Costco yesterday, and people were back to buying 3-4 30 roll packs of toilet paper. Why the hell do you need 120 rolls of TP? 

I have lived in many cities throughout my life, and have seen floods, wildfires, cold snaps and heat waves. Vancouver has seen all of it  in just the last year alone.  Let's not forget Covid. We didn't have it easy, that's for sure. But I have never seen this much desperation, not even in third world countries.

But seriously, let's do better. Take what you need, and maybe a bit extra if things are really grim. Share with people around you. Don't panic buy stuff at the slightest uncertainty. And if you do buy way too much, consider donating it to your local food banks or community service programs.

&#x200B;

But on the flipside, Toronto is closer to my hometown, a bigger city, doesn't deal with wildfire smoke in summers, and maybe easier to find a job to due to size (though with a degree in the natural sciences I feel like Vancouver isn't bad for job prospects, right?). I've also seen some disheartening things about how hard it is to make friends in Van, is this specific to the city itself or is it more of a North American thing in general, like would I have a harder time making friends in Van as opposed to Toronto or NYC? Also I'm carless so would this be a problem in downtown Vancouver, I'm familiar with the skytrain but have only used it a few times so not sure what it would be like to rely on it for getting around.

I'm hoping to get into some things like hiking, soccer, and environmentalism (like volunteering or joining a community garden).

Kamloops: Highway 1 to Cache Creek, then continue on Highway 1/97 to Kamloops.


Kelowna and rest of Okanagan: Highway 3 through Princeton, continue to Keremeos, Highway 3A towards Penticton, Highway 97 to your destination.

Merritt: Highway 3 to **Princeton**, Highway 5A to Aspen Grove, Highway 97C to Merritt.

Vernon: Although going via Kamloops is the most direct route, as White Rock Lake fire has a higher potential to affect Highway 97 between Monte Creek and Vernon the new fire in West Kelowna, I would recommend going via Kelowna, or be prepared to have to go through Salmon Arm.

Caution for following locations.

Highway 1/97 between Cache Creek and Kamloops: Tremont Creek could potentially affect the highway. It has not at this time.

Highway 3: May close at any time between East Gate Manning Park and Princeton due to fire. Very unpredictable. Closures are possible as per local contractor.

Highway 97: There is a developing volatile fire between Peachland and West Kelowna that could potentially affect the highway. There is no good detour in the area. 

Routes between Highway 1 and Merritt: both highway 8 and 12 are closed. Don't expect them to be open soon.

I will try to keep this post updated as situation changes. Edits in bold.

Canada uses a scale called the AQHI (Air Quality Health Index) which takes the readings of three primary air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2 and O3) and distills them into a scale from 1-10, with health messages associated with different levels of the scale. If readings get very high, the scale goes to “10+” because the health message doesn’t really change when you go above a certain level of the pollutants: it’s all bad.

[Metro Vancouver](http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/air-quality/Pages/default.aspx) monitors air quality in the Lower Mainland and has a detailed website with lots of information, including [AirMap](https://gis.metrovancouver.org/maps/Air) which shows current readings. You can see AQHI values and forecasts for different zones of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley on the AirMap. You can also see the underlying concentrations of the various pollutants. Metro Vancouver has an email subscription service if you want to be notified about air quality advisories or other news.

The provincial Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy monitors air quality outside of the Lower Mainland, with lots of information on their website at [bcairquality.ca](https://bcairquality.ca). They also show Metro Vancouver’s data on their [interactive map](https://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/find-stations-map.html) with AQHI values in communities which have the necessary data for the calculation, and raw pollutant concentrations in other communities. The [AQHI page](https://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/data/aqhi-table.html) shows current and forecasted values for the whole province - you can see which areas are really getting hit hard right now. The province also has a subscription service which can text or email you about air quality issues in specific areas.

Since it’s all open data for anyone to access, there are other websites that pick up the data and display it in other ways, e.g. with different maps and visualizations, or that do different calculations (e.g. using the US AQI which is a completely different scale to the Canadian AQHI). Some also use data from citizen science sensors like Purple Air that people can buy for their homes, but which do not have the same level of quality control on the data as the government stations do. However, there are way more of them out there than there are government stations, so they can help expand coverage in areas that don’t have it, or provide truly “local” data for you. I definitely encourage you to explore the various websites, but with the caution that you should try to know where the site is getting its data from and how it might be calculating things differently from the official sources.

Hope people find that useful. Covid-19 has made a lot more people aware of the nuances of data collection and interpretation and the importance of understanding your data sources and how the same numbers can be used and displayed in different ways!",vancouver,"Looks like wildfire smoke is starting to move in, but not at ground level (yet) - here are some information sources on air quality",0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/ovupeq/looks_like_wildfire_smoke_is_starting_to_move_in/

Other regions look worse, but that doesn't help in knowing if the Knouff lake area is a good spot to be in the first place.

Would anyone from the region or with more knowledge about wildfire assessment than me (I have none), have any advice?

Also, I couldn't find any government of BC advisories in terms of whether or not they suggest to suspend trips to the Kamloops area.

It's clear skies here at the moment, but consider buying one now (while they are in stock) before the smoke problem inevitably gets here. I've noted a huge difference in the air quality in my home without the smoke even being here yet (I live on Hastings by the tracks - don't know why I didn't get one sooner). That is all.

With my family connections, I know a lot of christians who are otherwise great people, but have completely signed off on taking a vaccine. The common anti vax conspiracy theories you've probably heard and dismissed (bill gates, 666 chips, etc) are spreading like wildfire among religious communities, and there's no end in sight. The seed is planted when a person first learns these conspiracies by members of their church, and feel the need to spread it to as many people as they possibly can in an effort to help them. The vast majority of people I've spoke to in the past few months regarding this have told me they will not take the vaccine. They have also told me that they haven't spoken to a single person who intends to take this vaccine. 

My advice to you: even after the vaccine has become widespread in usage in this province, stay diligent, and stay safe. Herd immunity will not become a reality when people are unwilling to take this vaccine. To protect yourself and others, continue to social distance after it's stopped being mandatory, and wear a mask. Tell your children to do the same, because they will NOT vaccinate their children.

 This is NOT just extremists. This is your neighbor. People who seem otherwise completely normal have fallen for this bullshit, and they will choose this hill to die on.

I just wanted to share my experience for those wondering what ICBC’s road test looks like during COVID-19, in the 2nd week of returning to normal bookings, and with the wildfire smoke lingering. Some of the points below might be similar to other ICBC locations as well, but I can’t guarantee it.

I took the road test today and so far was OK and passed it. Here are a few points:

1. Upon arriving, park your vehicle in one of the road test parking stalls, make sure you’re reversed in
2. You will need either a photo of your license plate OR a copy of your current insurance registration
3. There is a dedicated entrance and line for road tests
4. Upon checking-in you will be asked health specific questions and other admin stuff
5. Remember to have 2 photo IDs - your current license can be one of them
6. After that, you will be handed a surgical face mask. I wear glasses and they’re very good and doesn’t fog up the lenses. If you’re not comfortable with a mask, you will have an option to wear a provided face shield
7. You will then be asked to wait outside beside your car and wait for the examiner there
8. The examiner I had was Jessica and she was well equipped with PPE - mask, seat cover, gloves, and some kind of goggles for eye protection that looked like sunglasses 
9. Once the examiner is there, you will do the usual checks - lights, windows, wipers, hand signals, etc.
10. One thing she asked that was unusual was “Show me how you defrost your windows.” Since I have an older car with no heated windows, I showed her the heater for the back window, and put my AC on high heat and set vents point to windows and windshield (NOT manually point your vent to the windows, but set your AC to that setting that has the air blowing into the windshield)
11. She also asked where the “emergency brake"" is -  which is the same as your handbrake or parking brake
12. The examiners will give you instructions way ahead of time so that's you have more than enough time to perform the lane change, turn, etc. She also said I can repeat and verify what she said to make it easier
13. At this point, I asked if school zones are in-effect - they are
14. Beginning at the parking lot, our route was
   1. Exit left to Kwantlen St.
   2. Left on Alderbridge Way
   3. Right on Lansdowne Rd.
   4. Right on Gilbert Rd.
   5. Turn right then merge left to Russ Baker Way
   6. Exit right to Cessna Dr. (BCIT) - note dedicated merging-out and reserved (bike and bus) lanes here
   7. While driving on Cessna Dr., I was asked to list hazard perceptions
   8. Left on Miller Rd. - note 3-way stop, no entry lane and bus lanes
   9. Turn left to Russ Baker Way
   10. Exit right to Hudson Ave. - note that Burkeville is virtually all 30 Km/h zone due to small roads, playgrounds, and school zones. There is a sign immediately as you turn so watch out.
   11. Left on Catalina Cres. (A one way street and playground area)
   12. While driving down Catalina Cres. A FedEx truck was making a delivery and blocking half the road. The examiner asked me what I should do - I said this is a one way road and there should be no oncoming traffic. But to be sure, I used my signal, shoulder check, and pass the truck slowly (basically I gave my personal judgement). She agreed and even told me I was very observant to notice that this was a one way street.
   13. Left on Handley Ave.
   14. Left on Airport Rd. (still a 30 zone, in the end she told me I went a little over 30 here, but no deductions. I was probably distracted since it was a straight and wide road)
   15. Right on Hudson Ave.
   16. Turn right and merge left to Russ Baker Way
   17. Left on Gilbert Rd.
   18. Left on Lansdowne Rd.
   19. Right on Alderbridge Way
   20. Left on Elmbridge Way
   21. On Elmbridge Way, I was asked to pull-over (note the signs for no stopping zones, loading zones, etc. and fire hydrants). While parked, I was asked to simulate up and down hill parking, and also how to open my door properly.
   22. Continued on Elmbridge Way and left on Minoru Blvd.
   23. Right on Alderbridge Way
   24. Turn right to mall entrance and back at the parking lot where I was asked to reverse in a parking stall
   25. Take time to perfectly do your reverse parking (you’re not timed and judged on this) and always to a 360 check and look towards the back and not use your rearview mirror
15. After the test, you will review your drive with the examiner. If you pass, you will be asked to come in to the office to process your new license.
16. I was told the new license will take up to 60 days these days because of all the delays.

Overall, the experience was great since it was fast, straightforward, and safe. My tips are to keep an eye on your speed, shoulder check, regularly check your mirrors, and communicate with the examiner.

Hopefully this helps y’all get your license given these difficult times. Good luck!

Did some reading on its history and although it’s been around over 110(!) years, it had some recent upgrades to the stage which seems good from an audience standpoint. Sound and lighting were terrific.

My issue is with the grounds and infrastructure. 

First off, I’m the type to dance all night regardless, but noticed the grass/dirt was quite uneven and I was blowing mud out of my nose by night’s end lol. Can the caretakers/city not invest in some type of astro-turf to level out the dancefloor and eliminate the crazy dust and potholes?

Also, why are there only porta-potties up a hill with no steps? No outdoor hand washing station even? They got filthy eventually, can’t imagine being a lady and having to sit in one…

Lastly, and I realize this will be a controversial stance, but there could/should be a designated smoking/vaping section in the back corner.
Once the sun went down security stopped enforcing the non-smoking rule anyways.

EDIT: just realized I posted the title going backwards whoops!

Given the heavy smoke expected in the next few days and having nothing to do on a Friday night, I decided to loop the Central Valley Greenway (CVG) and BC Parkway (BCP) tonight from Commercial and Broadway to New Westminster. Earlier this week someone was discussing the awkward Rupert Station transition (it's gotten worse!) but there's other screwy spots that make this an intermediate/advanced ride, which is a shame because this could otherwise be a really fun day trip/outing. The following is a pretty comprehensive review

BCP Eastbound Vancouver - 8/10 Overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride in Vancouver proper. Heading through Trout Lake on the dedicated bike path is pretty easy and people generally stick to the gravel pedestrian path. There's a short but steep climb between 19th and Stainsbury to reconnect with the skytrain line at Nanaimo. The bike path at Nanaimo has been really improved recently, with clear separated lanes to a dedicated incline at Nanaimo Station up to Slocan st. There's an awkward transition at Slocan to 29th ave that requires a bit of road use, but then the dedicated path behind 29th is pretty well developed and spills on to Vaness, which is not a busy road when it needs to be taken. Passing Joyce station I find it much simpler to take Venables St to Boundary than the separated bike path because of heavy pedestrian use, and relatively light vehicle traffic with intersections only on the south side.

BCP Burnaby - 6/10 Similar heavy pedestrian use on the path in Central Park path with no real work around. The Metrotown area again has heavy shared pedestrian use on the bike path, and I found it was better to ride Beresford alongside very light traffic. Crossing the road at Willingdon requires a lot of caution. The transition at Central Blvd and Imperial has been improved from a very thin awkward sidewalk riding against traffic, it's been widened with a vehicle fence which feels so much safer. Once you get back on the parkway the ride gets pretty choppy with many busy and undeveloped vehicles crossings that require a lot of caution until you return to Beresford. I also found the road to be better than the bike path, although I've taken both without issue. The traffic is very light and there's no absent minded pedestrians. Crossing to Prenter St the path gets very narrow, with construction entirely blocking a transition on to the bike path. Edmonds Station gets very nice again with a short dip through a park and a dedicated path behind the skytrain maintenance yard.. The path is winding with a steep decline, so it's definitely best to have the brakes ready! Overall this stretch is a real joy until 22nd Station in New Westminster.

BCP New Westminster - 4/10

What. The. Fuck. As soon as you get across 22nd station you're riding a thin sidewalk along Stewardson, which is the BCP in both directions and the only pedestrian sidewalk. Thankfully I was the only using it at the time. Lots of intersections to be cautious of right turning drivers along. This is NOT a safe path to ride, use a lot of caution. Once you get to Quayside things open up a bit again with shared road and light vehicle traffic. There's one section of diagonal train tracks to watch out for along this stretch lest you catch a wheel! Crossing the train tracks to Columbia St leads to a nice separated bike path downtown, the transition to the CVG at the Patullo.

CVG New West (Westbound) - 4/10

Things are really nice until you pass the Patullo. Then you're stuck on a thin stretch of sidewalk with only plastic pylon barriers, riding against traffic until Mcbride st. This section is very unsafe to navigate without a lot of caution, nerve wracking, it's a busy road and there's nothing but a few plastic bumpers between you and the oncoming traffic. Things get nice and riding through the park at Victoria Hill, only to end up back against traffic, crossing driveways and intersections on the sidewalk at E Columbia.... Not ideal but not scary like the previous, and next part. As soon as you cross Cumberland St there's about two blocks of incredibly narrow shared use sidewalk, with pedestrians and two way bike traffic for about 200m. Like this would be nerve wracking to walk along if it was busy, much less ride. I would even have trouble dismounting safely here, so thankfully there was no pedestrians. Then there's a massive hill to climb on E Columbia heading to Royal Columbian, followed by a downhill to catch your breath at Kelly St. Following Kelly to Hume Park the CVG gets a dedicated lane again, which is a nice descent that wraps around the park to the bottom of E Columbia/North Road. A clear crossing, a slight separated path, then you're back on the sidewalk against traffic on North Road. With no signage to tell you to follow a dim path east off North Road on a gravel path, I lost the connection and ended up taking Lougheed Highway to Vancouver.

CVG Burnaby - 8/10

Again I missed the connection and ended up going against traffic on North Road until getting to a bunch of parking lots, where I took a break and walked it through. However I've ridden the Burnaby portion of the CVG before and can say that this is a much nicer bike path with dedicated trails through Burnaby Lake and shared lane with light traffic along Winston and Still Creek. the only issues that really presents itself with crossings is an awkward intersection at Douglas Rd and Still Creek. There's no simple way to navigate this intersection so use caution. I'm also not a huge fan of separated lanes running along sidewalks that cross parking lots, so tend to just use Still Creek when traffic is light. The little path connecting Gilmore is really cool, but it tends to flood in the spring/fall. A little path behind the home depot to Boundary, and a large crossing with a pedestrian light connect to Vancouver. Honestly pretty good!

CVG Vancouver - 8/10

Honestly this path is generally well thought out and straightforward with very few inclines. It's one of the ideal bike paths I've seen in this city with minimal light shared road use EXCEPT for Rupert Station. You may as well just walk it right now anyways, since the East side of the street next to the station is barricaded to dismount anyways. A steady incline to Nanaimo st (felt brutal by this point haha) and then a mix of dedicated and traffic controlled lanes to E 10th ave. Technically the path crosses Broadway here and continues left on 8th, but for transit connection go left. There's an awkward hard left turn and a mixed use pedestrian crossing, but the short stretch of 10th between Victoria and Commercial has again been greatly improved.",vancouver,Cycling review (long): Central Valley to BC Parkway Loop,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/15v8sue/cycling_review_long_central_valley_to_bc_parkway/

Some backstory: I rent an apartment in a house built in the 80s in Vancouver.  At some point; around 20 years ago, the house was gutted and turned into 4 separate residential units. Apartments, if you will. 

Ever since the day I moved in, the neighbours upstairs have been giving me trouble. Literally, my first night spent in this place I woke up to banging on my door from the guy upstairs telling me that my stereo system was humming all night in the living room. I do *not* have a stereo system, and at the time I literally had almost no possessions. I showed him my empty living room, told him I don’t have a stereo system, and he left disgruntled. 

Ever since then it’s been a bombardment of complaints from him. In the 1.5 years I’ve lived here he has come down 100+ times. He complains about the slightest noises, he’s interrogated my friends and guests, asking them who’s living in my apartment. He’s accused me of using his trash cans, and a bunch of other crap that I have never done. Sometimes his wife will send me a kindly worded text about something, but when he comes down and bangs on my door he totally blows his top. 

The last time he came down, a few days ago, he accused me of smoking pot inside (which is something I don’t do). Other tenants in the building smoke weed, and the ventilation is all connected, but he insists that it’s me. I told him to fuck off or I’ll call the cops and he called the landlord, who basically just called me and apathetically reiterated the buildings no smoking policy. 

In the past few days he’s been wearing shoes inside and stomping on the floor like crazy, and letting his kid go crazy with playing/screaming/etc. Its really petty. I know I’m a good tenant and neighbour because I’ve never had any issues like this in my life before, and I’ve rented lots, shared rooms, you name it. I’m not sure how to deal with this guy.

I was feeling pretty low at my work today with all the overlapping urgent projects and deadlines, so I just starred out my window blankly (I know, nice to have a window). 

I then noticed a very old gentleman walking across Smithe street with a seeing eye cane (more commonly known as a “probing cane” or “white cane”) very slowly, and I thought to myself “man, he better get a move on before the light changes.” And he didn’t get a move on, but he made it across without getting smoked by a blind bmw. 

He then needed to traverse Hornby street when a large young punk approached him (not really a punk, but had large headphones on and I feel like “punk” enhances the story) approached the gentleman and bent down – and I thought to myself “that old dude is going to lose his seeing eye cane now.”

BUT, the large young man must have said something nice – BECAUSE they held hands and walked across Hornby Street! They held hands, and the young man helped that old dude across the street. Then, the young guy just said “bye” and hustled up the other way! And didn’t push anyone or take anything.

I still can’t believe it. And it really made me feel good about everything.

 * *Flash Deals* - This is a section for stores doing special deals for a limited time like Black Friday or Boxing Day.
 * *Friends of /r/Vancouver* - This is a section for stores that give /r/Vancouver a small discount. Categorized by discount and then by alphabet.

I'll update the thread usually pretty quickly, but it could take a few hours from time to time.

*Personal Note*: May be AFK for a few days, baby arrival is 12/19 hopefully.

**STORE OF THE WEEK - [Small Noggin Studios](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Smallnogginstudios)**

I’ve learned small, cute stationery are great ways to cap off a gift to a friend, co-worker, or even some family members. It’s like a *bonus* surprise to them, and chances are you can find one that is personal to you and the individual. A great example with Small Noggin Studios that I’ve used is Awkward Monkey with a few co-workers as an inside joke.

One other thing I love is their reversible magnets. They have one for dishwashers and feeding pets.  

Small Noggin Studio is filled with cute stickers and magnets, it’ll be difficult not to find one that is funny to you.

He then called me yesterday morning saying he was kicked out of his moms and in bad shape (he is an adult, lives in Fraser Health region) so I picked him up and brought him to my place to talk.

^^^^^

I then realized the extent of the situation as he pulled a roll of tinfoil out of his bag and started smoking what I assume is some sort of super-heroin (worse than fentanyl because somehow he still passed a urine test for his father this morning after I had him picked up from my house).

^^^^^

The way he was acting on it makes me think it was one of the new variants that contains Benzodiazepine analogs that are not yet identified here so tests won't show them, but I have never seen anyone more incapacitated in my life and I was unable to have a real conversation with him the entire time he was here. He fell down multiple times, had scrapes and bruises already when I picked him up, and was in and out of states of what seemed to be psychosis saying things that made no sense and even walking back in to the house thinking he was at his dad's house at one point.

^^^^^

I was just in awe because this is someone i've watched battling addiction for many years, he's overdosed multiple times, but finally was stable and building his life again until this week I guess. I sat there with Narcan the whole time as he came in and out of consciousness with no sense of reality. I texted his dad and told him what was going on and he came and picked him up to take him straight to Royal Columbia in the hopes they would do a 72hr psych hold or whatever the standard protocol is, but somehow, they let him refuse treatment and walk away despite the fact that he looked like he was about to die. His dad told me he just asked ""Am I being detained?"" Repeatedly and they let him walk away.

^^^^^

He is currently sleeping at his dads house and I know as soon as he wakes up he will head out to find more of that shit. He said multiple things about self-harm last night, but problem is that he often would sarcastically say that for as long as i've known him so it would be disingenuous for me to say that he meant it this time, so IDK what to do.

^^^^^

 I am the only one he trusts, he's having paranoid delusions with everyone else, so if he knows that I called in and got him picked up I would potentially lose all contact with him and maybe never see him again. At the same time, he's so gone right now that I have no hope of any sort of personal intervention, HEAVY duty medical intervention is likely the only way he lives in this scenario. I don't know what to do, his parents don't know what to do (they are divorced and don't speak but i've been in touch with both of them exchanging info and filling them in on the reality of the situation).

My coworker D (F) came with me as support. 

When we arrived on scene there were a couple men surrounding a man who was collapsed on the sidewalk, blue in the face, not breathing. I’ve never seen someone like that before. One person was giving (poor) CPR. 
Nobody called 9-1-1 yet so D got on the phone right away while I get started on the naloxone. I point at an onlooker staff and yell to get an AED. (I should mention as per my job requirements, I have to have emergency first aid and CPR-C, and thankfully I just renewed at the end of august) everyone around me looked clueless. They had no idea what an AED was.

When the first dose gets into this guy’s system, he gasps for air, and I can actually see his face become more pink. But the effects are short-lived and I continue giving naloxone until I’ve run out of doses. I continue to yell for an AED (surprisingly at my job there isn’t one) until someone understands). Somewhere in between my manager S (F) comes out and she takes over CPR. This guy would breathe for a little, and then slip back into unconsciousness. I finally got an AED at the same time the paramedics arrived. They took over and so we left the scene to give them space to work. 
Later we find out he declined the ride to hospital, is up and talking and having a smoke. 
The paramedics said if we had not been there, he would not have lived. He said thank you to D when she saw him later. 

I’m generally very calm and logical during emergencies as I’ve been through a lot now (even though it shouldn’t be common my my profession). But I’ve never actually had to use naloxone, or use/see actual CPR, or see someone dead/dying/brink of death, or need to control the scene. I’ve learned that again theory is very different than reality. 

1. Naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose but definitely does not last as long as we were taught
2. CPR looks way different on an actual person 
3. Not everyone knows what an AED is
4. Someone who looks like they’re dying is more obvious than I thought (vs sleeping) 

Anyway, I just wanted to share what I learned today, and maybe discuss any tips or advice for future emergencies or any “firsts” that wasn’t what you expected. 

TL;DR Me and my coworkers brought a man back to life from the brink of death from opioid overdose and this was my first big emergency scenario and it was way different than what I learned

ETA: thank you for the awards! Thank you for letting me know about potential PTSD. I will be more aware and mindful of my mental state and speak to a professional if needed. I really appreciate all the kind words and advice/tips as well!

Edit: 
So I wasn’t expecting that much slack for expressing that SAD season feels like it’s coming early but here we go. Let me first say I have had a glorious summer filled with time off, good travel, good company, good food, my good dog and wonderful husband. As someone that regularly see’s a therapist, takes medication and has regular and integrated coping mechanisms like exercise, art, video games, reading, fulfilling work; my life is good.  But experiencing depression (in its infinite and surprising ways it shows up), has taught me the value in checking in with my body. Also as some people have expressed, seasonal depression starts in the summer and the cooler shorter days are welcome relief. The most important thing whether or not it appears too early or too late to be experiencing SAD, listening to your body is a really helpful coping mechanisms.

It’s  probably going to get nasty and smoky this week and the weekend might be  particularly bad. There are several forest fires in the eastern part of  the North Cascades. We have been spared the smoke from them by the  normal westerly pattern of our winds, but we are about to enter a period  of easterly flow.

Worse, the easterly flow is modeled to be *very* strong and *very* dry by Saturday. If it all goes as modeled, those fires are going to *explode,* and all that smoke will be sent into northwestern Washington and southwestern BC.

Like it or not, smoke season  is the new normal. It is not just climate change (although that *is* certainly part of it). There is evidence that before the eras of white settlement and fire suppression, *a lot*  more forests burned every warm season. 100+ years of trying to put out  every fire that starts has left us with a severe “fire deficit” that is  now getting paid back with interest.

Hey Vancouver, I’m a new immigrant looking for advice. 

I just got a document emailed to me from my landlord and strata with timed and dated complaints against my partner and I for smoking weed inside our tiny unit. Four instances of complaints. 

But we don’t smoke inside. Genuinely. 
We have fresh weed in the unit, but when we do smoke it’s always outside, around the corner & away from our building. 

I can smell weed and tobacco all the time when I’m in the common areas, but it’s just part of living in an apartment! I’m not justifying breaking strata laws, I’m just saying. 

What can I do? I sent back an email confirming that it wasn’t us, but I’m very nervous about this. I really don’t want it to escalate further. I like living here and with the rental market - I don’t know what else we’ll find within our budget if the  landlord decides they want us out because of these false complaints against us. I’m also new here so I have 0 references. It was so hard to even secure this place :(

I am just curious to know if everyone has their favourite place to get burritos from & would like to hear some suggestions.

I've definitely tried multiple locations in town like tacofino, red burrito in cambie village near save on foods... etc etc. All good places :)

By far my top favourite burrito place is called Taco Luis in Landsdowne Centre. Worth the trip imo. 

Back in the old days where tigers used to go on hikes in the North Shore mountains and smoke cigarettes with our ancestors (?) it was before Oakridge Centre closed down for redevelopment, Taco Luis was always my go to restaurant for a cheap 5 dollar burrito dinner (Now it's like 7 dollar something) as a financially poor university student back then lol. It was actually very healthy for fast food imo. Lots of veggies and the quality was actually great. They have 10 and 12 inch options and chicken/beef for meat. Chicken is like 25 cents more expensive than beef but their chicken is so good. 

The store owner was from China (He definitely told me his name at one point, but I can't remember his name) and he sure was a funny, energetic and humane person with every customer. He always thanked me for coming. I think he's still working at the Landsdowne Taco Luis location from last time I've been out there & quality of Taco Luis burrito has never changed over the years haha!!

Monday, All students back at school. EA Zoe gets a phone call to pick up her son from his school. That evening, a kid from week 1 at our school, Max, is unwell in teacher Jones class. 


Tuesday, Max tests positive. Mom picks up his two siblings from school. EA Zoe goes home to go get her kid tested after finding this out. No one will test him. Just say he needs to isolate. 


Wednesday: George, a child in Teacher Jones class with special needs tests Positive.

This child works directly one on one with multiple EAs, including Zoe, and Helen, Susan and Beth. EA Zoe is now feeling unwell, and her four children are also unwell. Two children have fevers in Teacher Jones class and stay home. 


Thursday, EA Zoe away unwell, EA Helen stays home feeling unwell, EA Susan stays home as caution. No replacements for any of these EAs. EA Beth is still at work, helping cover in many classes including mine. Teacher Jone sends home a child who complains of a headache. Meanwhile, Teacher Smith goes home sick (she has sibling of original child Max in her class)

I suggested they get some water, and they do. But they continued doing it and then said their throat hurt. Then daycare came to pick them up, so I suggested they called the parents…. 

Shittiest part about it is, we are not allowed to notify parents to warn them their children have been exposed to Covid positive adults and students. It’s insanity. 

This is just the end of the first week… we had over 100 student absences today. Not all were illness, naturally many parents have kept their children home this week.

As one does in these situations, I called 911. My phone rang once and then it hung up. Instead of being listed as a dropped or failed call, my phone log displayed an icon for emergency services. Within a couple seconds, I could hear sirens in the distance. Still, I waited for about a minute, expecting  911 to call me back. They never did. 

This was a different experience for me. Thankfully I've only had to call 911 on a couple occasions but when I have, I usually speak to someone. I've never had the experience of being hung up on and not having someone follow up.  

Is this the result of our system being spread so thin? Have you ever had an experience like this? Am I just extremely lucky and privileged to have never had this happen before (yes)? Anybody got an idea what the hell is going on?

I wrote the list up on my blog, with fancy photos and whatnot ([link here](https://www.vancouvercoffeesnob.com/lists/the-10-best-coffee-shops-in-vancouver-2021/?utm_source=vancouvercoffeesnob&utm_medium=reddit&utm_id=Snobbies2021)), but here is the list in case you want the text version only:

*Quick Note: I'll be sticking around today to answer any questions you have about coffee in Vancouver, so fire away. (Sorry, I was a bit absent from my Best Roasters post, but I'll go answer everyone now)*

**10. Revolver**

325 Cambie St, Vancouver

The pandemic saw Revolver cleverly switch to a window-only method of serving coffee. But 2021 was the year of them reopening their doors to the public!

You can expect a huge selection of impeccably created coffee, some light sweet treats (their coffee cake is honestly the best I've ever had) and a chic and a stylish NYC-themed indoor space.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: I'm all about the pour overs at Revolver. However, when I'm feeling like it, their macchiatos are truly something special.*

**9. Veille Coffee**

2547 Montvue Ave, Abbotsford, BC V2S 3V2

Veille already placed number 3 on the Best New Coffee Shops of 2021 list, so it's a joy to see them in here too.

Vielle is actually just one person, Aimerance, operating out of a coffee van in Abbotsford!

You can expect espresso and filter coffee by way of Road Coffee Roasters, a friendly and welcoming experience and some killer treats.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Try their ""one coffee done three ways"" or ""three coffees done one way"" for a truly unique experience.*

**8. Modus Coffee Roasters**

112 W Broadway, Vancouver

On Siply - Yes!

2021 saw Modus truly solidify themselves as one of the best brunch destinations in the city.

Of course, their coffee game is still as strong as ever, with a focus on lighter and bright coffee. But we also saw the launch of their Coast roast, which is an astonishingly accessible coffee, as well as their beer collab with Studio Brewing.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: As much as I love Coast, a Modus experience for me is all about their LATIF or HIRO roasts. Always, always, always on pour over.*

**7. Smoking Gun Coffee**

46168 Yale Rd #101, Chilliwack, BC V2T 0J6

On Siply – Soon!

Taking the 1st place in the Best New Coffee Shops 2021 award and 4th in the Best Coffee Roasters 2021 award, apparently just wasn't enough for Smoking Gun!

You can expect a bright, airy and welcoming venue, with a great selection of house-roasted coffee. Their bean selection ranges from darker and accessible, all the way to light and bright.

Food-wise they have a great selection of locally created pastries, as well as house-made sandwiches. These are all served up by some incredibly friendly and talented staff.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Their Tanzania on filter was a bloody revelation. But if you can snag the owner, Brandon, get him to pour you a fancy latte art cladden milk drink.*

**6. Harken Coffee**

338 Powell St, Vancouver

Harken is what happens when you mix a team of preposterously skilled coffee nerds and give them a big fat roaster to play with!

The end result is a sleek and well-designed coffee shop with a roasting program that creates some truly mind-blowing coffee.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Their head roaster, Stacey, seems to have the magic touch with fermenty flavours. So if there's a natural process coffee on bar, I always favour that on pour over. That being said, their house-made alt-milk makes a wildly unique cortado.*

**5. Craft Cafe**

960 Quayside Dr Unit 115, New Westminster

On Siply - Yes!

In 2020 I had a cup of coffee in Craft Cafe (a Panama Geisha from Gardelli) that still goes down as one of the top 3 cups of my life.

The venue is bright, welcoming and has a huge patio by the water for the summer months.

Their coffee selection is so vast that you'd expect this cafe to be in Gastown. But it's not, it's in New West!

Food wise, they have some of the most delicious breakfast sandwiches and grilled cheeses I've ever stuffed into my greedy face hole.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Craft often have very high end coffee available at extremely reasonable prices. Their stance is that it's a great opportunity to get amazing coffee into peoples bellies without the crazy price tag. For that reason, ask the barista for a recommendation, then sit back and enjoy the ride (with a Canele of course).*

**4. Pallet Coffee Roasters**

980 Howe St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N9
2002 W Broadway, Vancouver, BC V6J 1Z4
3820 Oak St, Vancouver, BC V6H 2M5
1398 Kingsway, Vancouver, BC V5V 3E4
323 Semlin Dr, Vancouver, BC V5L 4H9
395 Alexander St, Vancouver, BC V6A 1C4

On Siply - Yes!

Arguably one of the most iconic coffee brands in Vancouver.

Pallet has six locations around Vancouver, as well as the eye wateringly beautiful Palate Kitchen. This cafe, by the way, scored a whopping 97% on my review last year.

I think my favourite location, however, is their HQ. It's a sprawling warehouse/cafe/roastery, with the finer details created by my favourite interior designer, Alice D'Andrea.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: At HQ they often have a single-origin espresso on bar. At any other location hit me with a cortado. If I'm sitting in their downtown location, I'm always going to favour a pour over.*

**3. Kafka's**

2525 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5T 3E5
577 Great Northern Way, Vancouver, BC V5T 1E1
151 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1H4

On Siply - Yes!

2021 saw Kafka's move their entire roasting operation from the US into Canada. The result is that they've been able to refine their already great roasts and focus on working directly with farms to buy green beans.

They have three locations across Vancouver, with their Main Street location being one of the OG third wave coffee shops in the city.

At each location, you can expect fantastic pour over and espresso-based drinks. In summer they introduce cold brew drinks too.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: I have a real soft spot for the innovative design of their Gastown location. While I'm there, it's always going to be a juicy, bergamot forward Ethiopian on pour over.*

**2. Prototype Coffee**

883 E Hastings St, Vancouver

On Siply - Yes!

Prototype are the one coffee shop where I consistently have my mind and my taste buds blown. Every. Single. Visit.

From their innovative ways of steaming drinks (see recommendation below) to the fact they often have 15-ish different coffees available for you to try. Oh and if you like one, they'll roast you a bag to order while you wait.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Their steamed nitro cold brew is such a unique drink that my mind often can't really process what I'm drinking, so definitely start with that! Their pour overs are always amazing, so I often ask the barista what their favourite is at the moment. When I leave, I always leave with a bottle of their Oatmilk Flat White.*

**1. Nemesis Coffee**

302 W Hastings St, Vancouver
101 Carrie Cates Ct #110, North Vancouver
555 Great Northern Way, Vancouver

On Siply - Yes!

To the surprise of no one, Nemesis reclaims the crown of the number 1 spot on The 10 Best Coffee Shops in Vancouver 2021 list.

Why is it not a surprise? Just look at the above photo. That is the coffee shop they opened this year.

Aint it pretty?

Their new GNW location is an absolute feast for the eyes. It merges possibly the most unique building shape I've ever seen, with impeccable interior design. But their Polygon and Gastown locations are not be downplayed either. Both are amazing.

The food and service program is, in my opinion, Michelin star quality.

From a coffee perspective, it's all house-roasted and direct to farm sourced, with a focus on transparency and fair payments.

Honestly, you just have to go to experience it.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: I always go for a pour over at any of their locations, with the Indian Ratnagiri being a real surprise of flavours. If I'm at GNW I'll favour anything with duck in it for food. Polygon is always a to-go breakfast sando, to enjoy by the water.*",vancouver,The Best Coffee Shops of 2021: A Public Vote,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/rt1lyg/the_best_coffee_shops_of_2021_a_public_vote/

**10. LÜNA COFFEE**

Light and bright is at the forefront of what makes Lüna Coffee tick.

You can expect light roast, bright and beautiful coffee, from this incredible little company.

Their efforts towards sourcing and transparency are leading the way for the Vancouver coffee scene. Plus their coffee is damn delicious.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Pretty much anything from Ethiopia! Their African coffees are always a juicy, fruity and intense experience.*

**9. AGRO COFFEE**

2021 saw Agro finally open their brand new roastery!

It’s bigger, better and they have an even chunkier roaster to pump out more coffee.

They closed their tasting room, so it’s online and stores only. But what you can expect is anything from one of the best dark roasts in the city, all the way to light and bright.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: My personal preference is their Roasters Choice series. They had a Colombian this year that was incredible.*

**8. NEMESIS COFFEE**

On Siply – Yes!

Nemesis only just started roasting this year, with the opening of their GNW location. But my god, what a start out of the gate!

Their coffee focuses on direct to farm trade, paying over-fair prices and roasting light and delicious.

Oh and don’t get me started on how beautiful their packaging is!

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Nemesis has close ties with a farm in India, so if you see coffee from that region on the menu buy that. You’ll get a bright, smooth and very surprising cup.*

**7. HARKEN**

As the unofficial founder of the Stacey Lynden fan club, I’m very happy to see Harken in the top 10 again!

For those of you that don’t know, Stacey is the head roaster for Harken and cut her teeth roasting in several of the big names around Vancouver.

Their coffee is light and intense, with a focus on high-end quality and varying flavour profiles.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: I’m a huge fan of their Winter blend on espresso, but hit me with a natural process coffee every time if we’re talking about brewing a pour over.*

**6. KAFKA’S**

On Siply – Yes!

For the longest time Kafka’s roasted their coffee down in the land of Eagles and freedom. But recently they moved up to Vancouver and have taken a more hands-on approach with their roasting.

The results are a might tigher and vibrant coffee experience, with their juicy, fruity and bergamotty (a new word I just made up) Ethiopian being a particular highlight of their new roasting process.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Their Simpler Times blend is a really special daily drinker when brewed on filter.*

**5. MODUS COFFEE ROASTERS**

On Siply – Yes!

Modus have been on the Top10 roaster list since I started it, and for good reason. Their coffee is freaking spectacular.

They’re one of the key roasters in Vancouver that always, and I mean always produce clean, easy to drink and vibrant coffees.

Their coffee shop is also a masterpiece of relaxed atmosphere and a regular who’s who of coffee nerds at the tables.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: I’m a massive fan of their LATIF roasts as well as HIRO when they have it on bar. But chat to the staff, tell them what you like and they’ll advise accordingly.*

**4. SMOKING GUN COFFEE ROASTERS**

Hot off the announcement of Smoking Gun being the Best New Coffee Shop of 2021, they smash their way into the Best Coffee Roasters in Vancouver 2021 list too!

You can expect anything from darker roasts, all the way to light and bright floral forward coffee. Sure you have to go to Chilliwack to see their cafe, but the team at Roaster Central has you covered if you want to try it in their showroom.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: I really liked this years Tanzania peaberry. It had some great juicy fruit notes to it and was really easy to brew.*

**3. PALLET COFFEE ROASTERS**

On Siply – Yes!

Let’s face it, this wouldn’t be a respectable list if Pallet didn’t make it into at LEAST the top 3!

They’re well known for having some of the best tasting, easy brewing and repeatable coffee in Vancouver.

Their range goes from impossibly well-balanced espresso roasts (Benchmark) all the way to their Motive series, which highlights interesting processing methods and micro-lot farms.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: Where to start? Literally anything I have from them is gold. OK if you insist, their Holiday coffee is always a good time, but if you can get hold of anything they roast from Kayon Mountain, it’ll be a moment you won’t forget.*

**2. PROTOTYPE COFFEE**

On Siply – Yes!

Every single coffee at Prototype is roasted on the above pictured tiny Bullet roasters! The end result is some truly spectacular coffee that’s painstakingly produced at the highest quality.

Prototype definitely focuses on light roast, so what you’re going to experience is bright, juicy, fruity and often very floral coffees.

That being said, they often dabble with experimental process methods that result in some pretty wacky flavour profiles.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: If budget allows, go for a Geisha and have your taste buds rocked. If you want to go middle of the pack, I often find anything from Colombia on their menu to be warm and inviting. For those of you with a sweeter tooth, they have Eggnogg lattes during the holiday period. But if you miss those, get a bottle of iced Oatmilk Flat White into your belly!*

**1. HOUSE OF FUNK ROASTING**

On Siply – Yes!

If I’m being completely honest, I was rooting for House of Funk to make it into the top 3. And for good reason – their coffee this year has been nothing short of bloody spectacular.

Head roaster, Ann Hnatyshyn, has spent 2021 working on what I consider two categories:

1) Crowd pleasers that taste damn good,

2) Mind benders that completely slap your palate around (in a wonderful way).

They’ve released some of the fruitiest and juiciest coffees I’ve ever tried, then completely changed direction the next month and launched coffees that have been aged in whiskey barrels and taste like booze!

Oh and if brewing coffee isn’t your thing. How about the fact that they released a carbonated coffee in a can this year!? It’s bubbly, zingy and packs a caffeinated punch.

*Vancouver Coffee Snob Recommendation: For the crowd-pleaser, I always aim at Mellow Caramello. It’s honestly one of the best daily drinkers I’ve ever had.

For espresso, their Technicolour is absolutely my favourite to use for iced lattes in the summer.

If I want to spice things up, I’ll open my latest Omakase subscription box. It’s sent to me each month and contains two completely batshit insane coffees that truly tantalize my tastebuds.*

**10. LUMINE COFFEE**

1965 W 4th Ave #103, Vancouver, BC V6J 1M8

In the heart of the 4th Ave drag in Kits, Lumine Coffee is a stunning and inviting cafe.

They have a selection of amazing pastries and a solid lineup of coffee featuring local legends Agro, as well as Detour and a rotating selection of other roasters.

Protip – there is comfy and quiet seating in the back of the venue.

**9. FORECAST COFFEE**

2980 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5T 3G3

Forecast started life in Whistler and very quickly expanded into Vancouver, with their newest Main St location.

It’s inside the old Starbucks Reserve venue, so it’s large, well setup and has heaps of seating. It gets crazy busy though!

Their coffee is roasted in house and I’m particularly fond of their light roast, which has been on rotation in my house for several months now (hint – it’s probably closer to medium-light for us wanky coffee snobs).

**8. AIYŌH CAFE**

3720 Oak St, Vancouver, BC V6H 2M3

If you look at their Instagram you’d be fooled into believing they are food only. But they have a subtle and incredible coffee program, featuring coffee from Harken (who incidentally were the best NEW coffee shop of 2020).

Their coffee game is small, but strong. Word on the street is that they’re going to be the first place in Canada to have an Osma Cold Brew maker.

**7. FOGLIFTER COFFEE**

3590 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5V 3N4

Foglifter opened subtly in the summer. But they have already secured themselves as a must-stop spot on the Main Street drag.

You can expect house-roasted coffee varying in intensity, from dark to light.

At the time of writing their lineup includes some incredible examples of Natural and Honey process coffee.

**6. SOON COFFEE**

The Amazing Brentwood Food Hall, 4567 Lougheed Hwy., Burnaby, BC V5C 3Z6

I’m particularly fond of this coffee shop, as they’ve set it up exactly how I would.

By this, I mean loads of automation in the drink creation and a fairly basic menu of coffee.

There are only a couple of roast types available and the drinks are espresso, filter and ice-based.

They also have arguably the most competitive coffee pricing in the city.

**5. SUNNY M**

4540 No. 3 Rd Unit 1345, Richmond, BC V6X 4E4
On Siply – Yes!

Sunny M only opened a couple of weeks ago, so it’s fantastic to see them so high on the list!

You can exect some very high-quality coffee available on espresso and pour over. Think natural process rare beans and the occasional Geisha.

All the coffee is roasted in-house, plus they have a small food menu that has been impeccably paired with the drinks.

**4. GENERAL STRIKE COFFEE**

1965 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5T 3C1

You may already know General Strike Coffee as Coffee Bus! They recently dropped the wheels, rebranded and built a cafe inside an art gallery.

All coffee is roasted in-house in tiny batches. You can expect micro lot beans, roasted impeccably, then served on espresso or pour over.

They’re very new, so keep an eye on their Instagram for more info on how they’re planning to grow.

**3. VEILLE CAFE**

2547 Montvue Ave, Abbotsford, BC V2S 3V2

Less of a cafe and more of a coffee shop on wheels! Veille Cafe is Abbotsford’s latest and greatest addition to their surprisingly fantastic coffee scene.

You can expect coffee from Road Coffee Roasters, served up from an ADORABLE van. Espresso and Filter coffee await you, along with some snacks.

I’ll admit I’ve actually not visited this cafe at the time of writing, but with a smiling mug like the one in the photo above, you can bet I’m getting my arse there ASAP in the new year!

**2. NEMESIS GNW**

555 Great Northern Way, Vancouver, BC V5T 1E1

On Siply – Yes!

Missing out on the top spot by only TWO votes comes the visual masterpiece that is Nemesis GNW.

This cafe is the first shop to score a perfect 100% on my blog.

You can expect impeccable house-roasted coffee. Service that matches any Michelin star restaurant with food to match the service.

But nothing will quite prepare you for how mind bendingly beautiful the inside of the venue is.

**1. SMOKING GUN**

46168 Yale Rd #101, Chilliwack, BC V2T 0J6

On Siply – Soon!

It’s been a true honour to watch Brandon, the owner of Smoking Gun, grow this business from a small popup-esque couple of venues to this full brick and mortar shopfront (literally, it’s made of bricks).

You can expect house-roasted coffee, from dark to light (their Tanzania is amazing). A decent selection of sweet treats and some absolutely on-point sandwiches.

Yeah they’re in Chilliwack and yeah it takes several days to drive there from Vancouver, plus you’re definitely going to need a boat to get past Watcom road. But it’s SO worth the trip.

It’s a bloody awesome coffee shop and you should add it to your list of must-visits.

Upon getting to waterfront, I ran into the rexall right next to the station entrance to grab a redbull. On my way out, a gent stopped me asking if I wanted to buy a joint for $5. I could see it was in the doob tube, maybe from the dispensary right across the street. I said ""sorry man, I would, but I've got no cash"". So he gave it to me anyways saying ""you smoke? Ah, of course you do, here take it"". Absolutely made my day! Now I'm going to smoke this joint after confidently completing my final. 

If you see this dude, you've a heart of gold! I'll be sure to pay it forward next time I've got a spare joint!

Edit: few people asking about it potentially being laced. I don't think it is. It's in a government doob tube, with the sticker intact. It wasn't pealed and re applied insofar I can see. And the doob itself looks like the normal machine rolled joints from dispensaries. Note, there is a dispensary right across the street. Still debating whether to smoke or not.

Edit 2: I haven't smoked it, probably not going too. Everyone here seems to assume I have no sense of awareness, believe I do. I can buy my own weed, legally, so its not a matter of ""omg11!!1!1 free weed!1!1"". The packaging and sticker are sound, the joint looks not tampered with from the outside. But I'm still very hesitant.

Update: smoked the joint at the art gallery, public area, decent amount of people around. Smoked just fine, same high I'd expect from any joint.

I'd of course checked for tampering, checked the brand on the packaging. Checked the sticker. Everything, to my knowledge and experience checked out. The joint itself looked like any other machine rolled government joint; the tip was still rolled tight, weed looked fine. Smoked it, no off taste or feelings.

Honestly this is post, from the comments has weakened my faith. I believe that a majority of people are good, and that they'll do generally good things. The guy who gave me the joint, was smoking, a joint while he gave it. Keep in mind there is a dispensary not 20 meters away, directly across the street.

Also a few comments that were, well strange. People were mocking this post by assuming I'm male becaa I happily accepted a free joint. I just find it a strange point to make, and strange thought to have when reading this.

Thankyou for listening to my post script monologue. I've enjoyed the joint, and now a beer. I confidently finished my chem final. Hell, even the lady at BCL made my day with a nice conversation.

I need long time North Shore big brains here.

I was recalling a story which took place at a bar in North Van, somewhere between 2000 and 2005. The bar or pub or club is no longer there, and we cannot for the life of us, remember what the bar was called.

I’ll give you some clues. Maybe someone out there remembers.

- Below 15th and Lonsdale, in the Lonsdale area. 
- It WASN’T Tantra
- There was a smoking room inside the place
- It was more like a night club than a bar (I think).
- The place no longer exists.

It is a small townhouse. My neighbor and his friends like to gather around in his house and smoke marijuana like every weekend. So you can imagine my house is full of strong marijuana. Just like tonight when I had families visiting, everyone thought I had been smoking that the whole day. 

I have two 5 year old girls and one toddler at home. 

I contacted Strata management office, but they said smell of marijuana is legal. But smoking is illegal. They want to me to actually catch my neighbor smoking in his house so they have evidence to do something. This sounds like a crazy idea to me. I can't just knock on their door and ask them to take a picture of when smoking marijuana....

So I am deciding if  I should end this lease term earlier and move to a new place.

After reading my contract, I found this part on my contact

 4. Tenant Leaves Before the End of Tenancy If Tenant ends the fixed term tenancy before the original term as set out in the tenancy agreement, the Landlord may  treat this agreement as being at an end. In such an event, an equivalent of ONE month’s rent will be paid by the Tenant to  the Landlord as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, to cover the Landlords cost of re-renting the rental unit and  must be paid in addition to any other amounts owed by the tenant, such as unpaid rent or for damage to the rental  property.  

So what's the outcome. If I end this contract earlier will I have to pay for just one month of rent as ""liquidated damage"" or I have to pay for rest of 7 months rent plus one month of liquidated damage ?

What's difference between liquidated damage and penalty here.

I recall During the last federal election, some Chinese liberal candidates used the same tactic.   “Vote for me because I'm Chinese and you are Chinese”. This candidate is also part of a group called United Front ( China government CCP) that likes to bribe politicians.  This is way dangerous than we thought. 

Now, we understand why the Liberals are always soft on China in every policy. They didn't even show up to condemn China's genocide in the Xinjiang region.

If you don't usually or haven't ever participated in a public hearing, this would be a fantastic one to make your first as it has significant implications for denser housing developments in the city. If you aren't interested in speaking, council makes it easy to communicate your support/opposition [in writing](https://vancouver.ca/your-government/contact-council-public-hearing.aspx) (put Adding Missing Middle Housing and Simplifying Regulations – Amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law in the Subject field).

This was already posted [a few days ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/166zeh5/dont_let_the_nimbys_win/), but I wanted to write up a summary to better inform people because, again, this is a *really* important proposal.

In short, if passed, this application would (among many other things - I strongly recommend reading pages 7-17 of the [Referral Report](https://council.vancouver.ca/20230725/documents/rr2.pdf) for a more detailed overview):

**1. Allow for the construction of ""missing middle"" residential buildings on lots zoned for single detached houses.**

Current zoning laws generally allow only for either a single detached house or a duplex to be constructed in RS zones alongside secondary units (laneway houses and basement suites). The vast majority of the city is zoned under one of nine different RS zoning types, meaning any construction denser than a duplex needs to go through a lengthy hearing process without a guaranteed outcome. This proposal would amend the Zoning and Development By-law to permit construction of  up to 4 units on a standard lot (minimum 306m2, 64% of RS lots), 5 units on mid-size lots (minimum 464m2, 13.6% of RS lots), 6 units on larger lots (minimum 557m2, 22.4% of RS lots), and up to 8 units on larger lots when the construction includes purpose-built rental housing.

These new higher-density constructions would have a maximum Floor Space Ratio (FSR) of 1.0, meaning that the maximum total usable floor space of these buildings would be the total area of the lot they're built on. However, new constructions with an FSR of 0.7-1.0 would need to pay a ""density bonus contribution"", a fee tied to the total square footage of the construction which scales with the number of units and the geographic area of the construction (see page 15 of the [Referral Report](https://council.vancouver.ca/20230725/documents/rr2.pdf)). New constructions would have this fee waived if they include at least one unit at below-market prices, or secure every unit as purpose-built rentals.

All constructions would be limited to three stories.

**2. Consolidate the nine different single detached house zoning types into a single new zoning type (R1-1)**

**3. Reduce the maximum size of new single detached houses**

All new constructions of single detached houses would have their maximum FSR reduced from 0.7 to 0.6. The Referral Report for this application reasons this will ""Discourage the replacement of existing houses with new larger houses by reducing the floor area for a new single detached house.""

**4. Increase the maximum size of laneway houses**

Laneway houses will have their maximum FSR increased by ~55%, from 0.16 FSR to 0.25 FSR.

**My takes**

* In general, I'm a fan of most of the stuff in this application. Middle-density housing is desperately needed in Vancouver, and this goes a long way to getting more of it built by including it in existing zoning bylaws. The rezoning process is a significant bureaucratic hurdle to denser housing constructions, and removing it will vastly speed up construction. This also means that these constructions will not be subject to the frustrating rezoning hearing process. However, this is still removing only one bureaucratic hurdle of many.
* I'd like to see this proposal go a bit further. You can fit a lot more than 6 units in a 3 story apartment when the lot is large enough, so increasing the number of units allowable on the particularly large lots around the city would be a nice addition to this proposal.
* The 1.0 FSR is too small for these constructions, and is the part of this application I'm most annoyed at. FSR for middle-density constructions needs to be bumped above 1.0, particularly for higher-density constructions. If the maximum single detached house FSR gets reduced to 0.6, this means you could potentially be building 8x the units on in only 1.65x the space, or only 1.15x if you want to avoid paying additional fees. This is how we get smaller, cramped units, which may not incentivize developers enough to construct middle-density housing.
* The ""density bonus contribution"" is the second thing I'm unhappy with, particularly the fee scaling with unit numbers and geographic location. Essentially, this disincentivizes developers against both building denser developments (which is against the whole point of this proposal!) and building them where they're needed most (in the west side, aka Area A). Given that margins for infill housing are already [pretty tight](https://morehousing.substack.com/p/proforma-video) (shoutout /u/russilwvong), this really strikes me as a poison pill clause, where council wants to be seen as taking action to promote middle-density developments, but doesn't actually want them to be built for fear of angering their voter base. Indeed, give the BC government's upcoming requirement to allow 4 units on lots zoned for detached homes, this seems like council's attempt to restrict construction while still complying with the provincial government's regulations.
* The consolidation of single detached house zoning types is sorely needed and a good step in the right direction for reducing and clarifying  zoning rules. This should make constructions slightly easier, though likely not faster (which is what's really needed). 
* Reducing the maximum size of single detached houses is... fine? I guess? It's an interesting thing to tag on here. This should disincentivize people from buying up lots for houses for sale just to rebuild them into larger houses, and instead incentivize building denser multi-unit constructions. But, if this is council's goal, there's better and more effective ways to go about this.
* The increased size of laneway houses is a very welcome change for laneways that actually get built, but this doesn't solve the primary issue with laneway construction which is the absurd approval process and timeline. But hey, this is still a nice addition.

In conclusion, there's a lot to like about this application, and a few things that could do with some changing before council approves it. But it's important to note that this is only one step towards getting more middle-density constructions going in this city; council still needs to work on improving permitting timelines and reducing other bureaucratic hurdles developers face when trying to construct denser infill housing.

This is the graph supplied by the district about reservoir levels.  For the last few years I've wanted to learn more about two additional aspects not covered in the graph:

1. What level can the reservoirs be drawn down to?  The Y axis goes all the way down to zero, so can we actually go that low on the graph?  Is zero ""dead pool"" status where water is too low to exit the reservoir?
2. During the rainy season, how quickly does this graph rise back up to peak storage?  Does the rainy season fill up the reservoir very quickly and we're just letting water run over the spillway for a few months every year because capacity reaches maximum in February or March?

I'm trying to understand the rationale behind why stage 2 restrictions apply to a graph that's currently sitting at 70% of the Y axis' capacity.  Does it have something to do with the recharge rate during the rainy season and how it could be inadequate for *next year* if there's less snowpack?

Looking to be taught by anybody who knows how this stuff works.

Figured it might be insightful for some to understand why the shortage and why everything is so expensive.

[This sign was 150k](https://imgur.com/a/ca3Kqo7)

I started this project with one of the best possible scenarios - I was given a lead time of almost 6 months before my lease commenced. My connection to a construction company owner got me acquainted with competent architects and engineers. The City of New West was particularly willing to help, given the need for childcare for the infant/toddler age bracket in the area. The space i am leasing is properly zones and didn't need major overhauls.

Even with all that considered, it was still a steep price just to get to this point. Before a single proverbial brick can be laid (wooden building you see).

Moving to the implementation phase, strict guidelines equated to higher costs. I found myself accountable to various stakeholders - from city officials and fraser health to the building owners and the government's childcare funding arm.

Additionally, staffing became a challenge as well. Factor in inspections, liaising with construction teams, and maintaining solvency, and it's a daunting task. I continue to have a full time job as a software engineer and my wife still has her current daycares to run. The funding scheme is beneficial for parents, but it's riddled with challenges.

The issue with funding and how everything is set up, is that most projects simply cannot be made viable under their guidelines for what we are allowed to charge.

A prime example: In specific locations where establishing a center is already tough, the maximum charge is pegged at $1485. With subsidies covering $900, parents shell out roughly $600. Even if parents were willing to pay more, say $700, the system doesn't permit it. This financial strain is exacerbated when trying to pay staff a living wage. Our infant/toddler staff, for instance, earns between $28-$32/hr inclusive of benefits and government wage subsidies. We could pay less, but that means they cant afford to eat and we just propagate the current problems. We need staff to be happy and have a place to live, taking care of young children is very demanding; both us as owners and the families in our centres want the staff to be happy.

Commercial leasing intensifies these challenges. Unlike residential leases, there's no protective oversight, just negotiations between owners and tenants. Due to current real-estate conditions, it's incredibly one-sided (i will let you guess which side has all the power).

To counterbalance costs, centers often impose miscellaneous charges, like application fees or meal plans. While these might be written off by some as it's just the cost of daycare; subsidized families bear the brunt. This is because subsidy doesn't always cover these if they're additional fees rather than the base fee. SO for example now they'd have to prepare lunches and snacks every morning before daycare, which is pretty hard when you have to get the child and yourself ready and drop them off to daycare and get to work.

On the topic of waitlists and application fees, they do serve a purpose. Numerous parents apply to multiple centers, leading to administrative hassles. Such fees can ensure genuine interest, improving efficiency. We have not had issues and do no charge for meal plans or applications fees, field trips etc. I feel like the price should be simple and straightforward so everyone can budget properly. But, due to the funding guidelines, i might be forced to add a meal plan for the new centre as it's just not viable otherwise and i'm pretty sure not all 48 parents want to pack lunches and snacks every day.

I think that roughly sums it up.

I hate posts that complain without offering any solution, so here are mine:

1. **Stabilizing the Economic Environment:** If the government wishes to standardize pricing, they must also stabilize factors affecting costs, like sudden interest rate hikes.

2. **Supportive Financing:** Propose special, low-volatility loans with competitive interest rates for budding childcare centers.

3. **Focused Grants:** Prioritize grants for areas with pressing childcare needs. There are some grants for nonprofits. But the ceiling to qualify is nearly impossible; i believe it only pertains to churches, schools and govt agencies.

4. **Government-led Initiatives:** Instead of the current setup where the govt wants to control prices but not deal with any of the risk or management, the could allocate park land for non-profit childcare centers and allow private management. Supplying the proper space while controlling what the lease for it is will remove a lot of variables and make this actually work.

Birth rates are declining because raising children is just absurdly expensive and hard. Most families require that both parents work to afford to live; maternity leave is a pittance in most cases. If this does not get addressed and more done to encourage and support families to have children, our future does not look too bright.

Fun facts:

- we are not allowed to advertise or accept applicants before fraser health issues a license.
- with the above consideration, i blanked all details.
- we currently have more than half of the 48 spots spoken for and continually receive calls to be placed on our waitlist from families who heard from someone we are opening a centre at said location.
- our current i/t centres are so full, my wife stopped accepting applications, all new children are enrolled strictly by reference from current families or friends. She is taking waitlist for our small NW centre as we can contact them first when we open the new one.
- in the last 5 years, we have not once had to advertise a spot for i/t and never had a vacancy.
- for 3-5 it's less demand but we only run 1 small centre and it's only for current families wanting to continue with us and staff wanting to see the children grow up (We let staff rotate between centres).

I hope my insights prove enlightening!

**[Edit]** 

Wanted to add:

1) when signing up for a daycare, check their fraser health violations. This is public and you can check here:

It was funded by our tax money so, it's.. uh really well designed.

All daycares will have violations, but check what they are and that they were fixed promptly on follow up inspections.

2) ~~Any daycare enrolled in CCFRI has an agreement on how much they are allowed to charge. This is also publicly available and i will get you guys a website as soon as i get home.~~

However, due to the party's inaction on housing and greedflation, I decided to march with the BC NDP instead, a party I've voted for and donated to.~~

~~I called the party office this morning, but their contingent is full. I was told that last year, Vancouver Pride Society restricted the sizes of political party contingents last year due to municipal elections (a lot of candidates wanted to march in 2022). These restrictions were extended into this year, even though there are no elections for the rest of 2023. MLAs and the SOGI contingent took up most spots and select volunteers rounded out the last remaining spaces.~~

~~The changes would have been fine, if they had been covered by local media or at the very least publicized on party websites. The person I spoke to on the phone did promise to forward my suggestion to the Comms team for 2024, since apparently quite a few people have called the party office wanting to march, but get turned away. I was offered the chance to volunteer at the NDP booth, but I haven't marched in five years so I had my heart set on it. I also feel it's important to show solidarity with the LGBTQ2S community given the anti-drag/trans protests (shoutout to /r/notadragqueen) and the discriminatory laws being passed south of the border.~~

~~So I've come to /r/vancouver for advice. What are some open-banner orgs that are accepting walk-on marchers for the parade? I am unemployed, so I can't join the corporate contingents like TD, BCAA or TransLink.~~

~~Thank you for any suggestions you could send my way.~~

Some of this might be obvious but I hope it's helpful- it's not impossible to have a good time in Vancouver if you know what you're getting into. Comment on what I'm missing!

Friday/Saturday nights:

1. TIMING: Arrive early (i.e. 10pm) to have a chance of getting in before the guestlist cutoff time (11pm) otherwise expect to pay $18-25 cover fee (plus $4 coat check). Don't be surprised if the non-guestlist line moves faster-the club is restricting how many people they want to let in at the cheaper rate.

2. BRING CASH: If you don't, you'll be charged $5 for the ATM and you'll only be able to take out $20 bills, which leaves you with change you'll probably end up throwing in the tip jar for convenience.

3. PRE-GAME: otherwise you will be paying $10-12 per shot in the club. However, if you are too intoxicated at the door you may be refused entry, so you shouldn't be seen openly drinking in the line.

4. ID: Bring two pieces of ID! BC is very strict about this and you will need to digitally scan your government ID and have your photo taken before entering.

5. RATIOS: The more sleazy straight clubs (e.g. Levels, Bar None, Granville strip) will be wanting to maintain an equal ratio of males to females and will let people bypass the line accordingly.  Go to those clubs with an equal-ratio group or be prepared to wait.

6. TRANSIT: Most clubs close at 2am unless there is a special event. From 1am- 2:30am, it is extremely difficult and expensive to get an Uber most Friday/Saturday nights especially if you're in a busier area. Be prepared to walk+bus to get out of downtown and keep your phone charged for Google maps.

7. VIBES: Vancouver doesn't go crazy. For the most part ""clubbing"" here is a bunch of people standing around in a hot room, pretending not to care while looking for someone to hit on.

RECOMMENDATION: Fortune Sound Club on a Monday or Celebrities on a Tuesday. Much cheaper, plus a younger crowd and decent music.
EDIT: I recommend Eastside Studios as a great queer space too!",vancouver,Vancouver nightclubs: simple things I wish I knew,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/13u4v6k/vancouver_nightclubs_simple_things_i_wish_i_knew/

hellotothatoneperson,,1683926237,,1683934099.0,13fxe5v,False,True,t3_13fxe5v,18,False,/r/vancouver/comments/13fxe5v/parents_unable_to_license_airbnb_due_to_500m/,0,"Hello, I’m posting to see if there’s any suggestions on a way for my parents to continue their semi-retired income stream. 

My parents live in a 4 bedroom house in Richmond. All 3 kids have moved out now so they are empty nesters. They are 60+ years old and started doing AirBNB in order to become semi retired as like most immigrants, they have no real retirement savings. They live in the same house and share the living room, kitchen, etc. with the AirBNB guests, like what AirBNB was originally intended to be. They have great reviews and are superhosts. 

When they first started, they tried to register the BnB but was unable due the restriction that there must not already be another BnB within 500m. They’ve ignored it so far until recently they’ve gotten a notice from the city to stop. 

What’s annoying is that they’ve checked out the other house with the BnB license and it looks like they are not currently running an AirBNB (no cars parked, house not in good shape in terms of maintenance or cleaning, can’t find any listings anywhere). My parents says it looks like they’ve long term rented out the house but can’t confirm. They’ve also heard that houses may be keeping the license to hold onto as the yearly fee is not high and it’s a good house-selling point. 

Is there anything we can do to allow my parents to continue running a shared house AirBNB at their primary residence?


Edit: someone suggested they offer it as long term rental and then deleted their comment. 

Airbnb offers them better control over when/who/how long someone can stay. This is particularly important because the kids will visit home once every few months and especially during holidays and birthdays so they cannot just kick out long term rentals.",vancouver,"Parents unable to license AirBNB due to 500m buffer restriction, any options?",0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/13fxe5v/parents_unable_to_license_airbnb_due_to_500m/

As far as i know, concession passes are available to under 18 and who come in low tax bracket. I believe international students who have restrictions to work for 20 hour also reside in low income. I know for few students this restriction have been lifted. However, they are paying full price because if you see the statistics, most of the students live in surrey, Coquitlam or production way area. On the other hand, most universities are in downtown/ vancouver. They have to get $180-$185  three zone pass for travelling.

BeeeeDeeee,,1683161594,,False,13753n8,False,True,t3_13753n8,60,False,/r/vancouver/comments/13753n8/how_to_find_safeaffordable_housing_for_a_senior/,106,"My father is a proud man in his mid-seventies in poor health.  He has heart issues as well as some mobility issues (can walk, but has fallen and been unable to get up).  He owns his own home on Vancouver Island in a smaller suburb, but it's in terrible shape as he is in no condition to keep the property in check (bordering on a hoarder situation, cobwebs everywhere, overgrown yard, etc.).  The frontage is limited, but if you saw the back yard, you'd think the place was abandoned.

I live on the mainland and am his only child relatively nearby.  He is stubborn and suffers from mild agoraphobia and anxiety.  But the thing I'm struggling the most to deal with is that he is not taking care of himself/his property.  He is hugely avoidant (the mail piles up unopened for years).  He's had his power shut off twice in the last year, leaving him scrambling to get it turned back on (he is a boomer and isn't great with technology to the point he couldn't figure out how to dial outside numbers on the cell phone he has).  

What scared me the most was last summer when his power went off the first time.  He fell in his garage and smacked his head to the point that blood was everywhere.  Because he has cordless handsets, he couldn't use his landline to get help.  He managed to finally prop himself up and crawl into his car and drove 45 minutes down the island highway to the nearest hospital.  We only found out because I keep tabs on him and, when I couldn't find him, I called around to the nearby hospitals.  This was utterly terrifying as he was in loads of danger with no way to reach out.  And because I'm in the city, I have no way to get to him quickly/easily.

Getting his power turned back on (due to privacy restrictions with BC Hydro) was a huge ordeal.  I've offered to take on his utilities logins so I can keep on top of the payments and he insists that he will get autopay set up.  He claims to have done this, but then his power got shut off again this morning and he managed to get ahold of me on his cell phone so I could merge in a call to BC Hydro to get it set back up and turned on again.  This has also happened with his internet and other utilities in the past.  When my husband and I went to visit him for his birthday, I was horrified to discover that his auto insurance had expired three months earlier and he had been driving around uninsured.  We marched him straight to ICBC and got that fixed while we were there, but we can't count on him to be upfront about these things when we aren't (he only allows us to visit 1-2x per year).

He owns his house outright, but has no income or significant savings.  The house (a modest bungalow) is too much for him to manage and is costing him too much to heat/power/take care of.  He forgot to fill out some important municipal forms/tax stuff and came \*thisclose\* to having the government selling his house out from underneath him.  This isn't dementia or alzheimers - he just avoids a lot of these important tasks due to anxiety/depression.

Due to his health and (what I feel to be) the danger he poses to himself, I want to move him over to the mainland and get him into some sort of supportive housing for seniors.  He doesn't need LTC (yet), but he needs an affordable option for seniors where he could maintain some independence, but also have me close enough by that I could get to him within an hour or two if something were to happen (and to keep on top of his living situation so it doesn't spiral out of control).

The problem is that he thinks everything is fine and should keep on as it is.  He shuts down any and every conversation that I try to broach with him about how his current way of living isn't working.   
 Which breaks my heart and has me swooping in to save him when these incidents happen.  And I guess he's able-bodied enough that I can't force him to move.  But even as-is, his house would need to be cleared out, repainted and fixed up before it could be sold.  I want him to do that, live off the proceeds and rent for the rest of his life, but he claims he doesn't want to do that so he has something to leave me and my siblings (we are absolutely fine and do not need his money or assets).  

A house in a small suburb (of mainly retirees) on the Island is obviously worth a fraction of Vancouver prices, so he wouldn't be able to sell there and buy here.  And rents here are out of control.  He also doesn't really like Vancouver (he has baggage), but I think I could get him set up in an older one-bedroom rental in White Rock, Squamish or maybe Maple Ridge?

Ultimately, I could really use some perspective and advice from anyone else who has experienced anything similar with elderly parents.  I am woefully unfamiliar with the legal parameters as well as where to go and what to do.  I'm sure that any affordable seniors housing has a significant waitlist, but I don't know where to start and googling has left me more confused than ever.  And I don't want to take away his agency, but I also can't leave things as they are as he is apt to get hurt or worse.  If anyone can offer up guidance or resources or even point me in the right direction of where to start looking, I'd be eternally grateful.   I'm overwhelmed with my own life and work and so stressed and scared for him (not to mention the daunting feeling of trying to find affordable/available seniors housing in the Lower Mainland which is already outrageously expensive with inflation to boot).

I've never had to stay in a hospital overnight, so this is all new to me. I'm feeling apprehensive and stressed. I've been told I need to get kidney surgery and will need to stay at VGH hospital for at least one week afterwards.

**Rooms**: I plan to request a private or semi-private room, but I know that's not guaranteed. I've heard most Canadian hospital put patients in wards. How many people are in a room? 4? 6? How big are the rooms? Do we all share a bathroom?

**Food**: How's the food? Can they accommodate allergies, sensitivities and dietary restrictions? I'm fine with fruits and vegetables, but I generally eat an all natural, gluten-free, low sugar, lactose-free, low carb diet (and that's based on recommendations from doctors). And I know if they feed me stuff that has artificial flavors and preservatives, there's a chance it trigger a reaction and make me sick.

**Comfort**: I plan to bring pajamas and a robe. Should I bring a pillow? A blanket?

**Power**: Do patients have easy close access to power outlets? So I can plug in a tablet, phone charger, etc. Should I bring an extension cable or a power strip?

**Air**: How's the air? Is the ventilation good? Can you open windows? I don't suppose they have actual HEPA air cleaners or anything, do they?

**Safety**: How do I best protect myself from getting COVID while I stay there for a week? I plan to mask as much as possible, but I'll have to take it off to eat - unless they serve me smoothies. I can try to sleep in it, but I don't know how comfortable that will be. I'm think of bringing a small HEPA air cleaner or CR box, if that's allowed.

I'm from the US, but my friend (who basically has no support system in CA) has become housing insecure. They have extreme dietary restrictions that require them to have a personal kitchen. I've become overwhelmed with the situation and am turning to y'all for any guidance.

They are unable to work, but the state has deemed them ineligible for PWD status. They receive income assistance to the tune of CAD 800/mo in addition to CAD 500/mo thanks to a gofundme. Total budget comes to 1300 CAD/mo.

Other than BC Housing (their application was rejected), are there resources for helping the disabled find housing?

Doesn't have to be in Vancouver proper either, just within a 3 hours by transit. So far all the landlords I talk to ask for proof of employment, but IDK what to tell them. 

I'm at my wit's end trying to find anything promising, so anything anyone can direct me to that might lighten the load would be appreciated.

SeaBrad,,1673989901,,1673990371.0,10eno8s,False,True,t3_10eno8s,181,False,/r/vancouver/comments/10eno8s/vancouver_folk_fest_cancelled/,383,"They’re voting to dissolve the society too. This means no more Folk Fest… ever? That’s a huge bummer.

From email:

“We are writing to you today with some very sad and difficult news about our beloved festival. As many of you will have read in our newsletter last month, our team came up against many challenges as they worked hard to put the festival together in 2022. Coming back after two years of COVID-restriction-related cancellations, we found that the environment in which we were operating had dramatically changed. 

From long-time suppliers being out of business, to cost increases, to many providers now requiring payment up front, it was a herculean task to produce the 2022 festival. In fact, we were only able to produce the event because of special COVID-relief grants that were available to organizations like ours last year. 

As our staff set about the work of preparing for the summer of 2023, we have been confronted with the reality that our VFMF Society simply does not have the resources to produce an event this year. The costs of the event, the cash-flow requirements, and our very limited budget for staff simply make it impossible. We postponed the decision for as long as we could as we strove to find a solution, but are at a point now where, even if the funding were to appear, we would not have time to pull the event together.

Since we will not be producing a festival this summer, we do not have the capacity to retain our two staff-people and have had to give them notice of lay-off. Having fought for the festival for so long, they appreciate the challenges and are understanding of the decision.

What about the future?
Unfortunately, the challenges that are preventing us from being able to move ahead with a festival in 2023 truly appear to be the “new normal” going forward. To proceed with an annual festival, we would require an additional $500,000 (estimated) up-front every year. We have determined that there is not enough grant or sponsorship funding available to support this budget increase, nor could our community sustain the increase in ticket prices that would be necessary to close the gap. 

In light of these difficult realities, the Board will be asking the members to approve a resolution to dissolve the Society at our upcoming AGM on February 1, 2023. Official notice of the meeting is being sent out today to all members who are eligible to attend.* 

The Board knows that for a lot of us the festival is a highlight of every summer and the weekend has become a part of the fabric of our community. We understand that this will be heartbreaking news for many and that you may have some questions. If you have questions, please read through the prepared FAQ, available on our website. We want to be as transparent as possible about the factors which brought us to the point of proposing the resolution to dissolve the Society. If you have questions that remain unanswered please direct them to info@thefestival.bc.ca. If you are a member of the media, you can view our press release here.

To all of the festival’s amazing staff, volunteers, members, artists, and attendees: thank you for being a part of our 45 years of magic and celebration.

Yours Sincerely,
The Vancouver Folk Music Festival Board”

Am new to the activities above, but would like to set on a good path to get started.

The ideal one night trip would involve camping, searching/harvesting firewood, cook food on said fire, whittle something to whittle the time away, and turn in for a night.

It is a lot of information to take in, with all the restrictions (understandable with the managed campsites), fire bans, crownland use, firewood regulations.

I'm wondering if my idea scenario is attainable, short of hiking to the middle of nowhere.

My friends and I have an idea for a podcast and thought we'd run it by the public to see if anyone would actually listen to it.

Essentially, it's a podcast where everyday people can come on and tell stories about funny or shitty past (or current!) work experiences.  Folks from every industry would be welcome to come on, even anonymously if they'd like. From office work, to service, to retail, to healthcare or trades, we want to light the campfire and hear what the Lower Mainland's got. Maybe like weekly episodes with 3 x 15 min interviews?

It would be a good outlet for people to come on and vent too. And maybe listeners who are going through similar situations at their work would be able to relate to the guests and know that there are others going through the same.

https://imgur.com/a/ODm35mG

This system would not need to be build overnight and could be built in phases that would increase the mobility of the region and allow for cheaper housing further away while also not requiring you to sell your soul to Hwy 1.



**Phase - 1: WCE improvements**

In this phase an additional track (with Passing pockets) would be laid from Port Coquitlam station to Mission City station. This would allow for consistent all day service to begin on this section of the line. Mission City station would be moved to the west to allow for the curve geometry to get trains to Abbotsford. If you notice there is a new station at Albion, this is to allow for Translink's new real estate arm to buy up land around the station and develop it. Buying the land should happen now.  


**Phase - 2: Ferry Line**

Everyone is always so confused why the ferry can't make more money and costs keep rising when they never change how many people can fit on a ship. The fix for this is simple, build rapid transit to the Ferry Terminal and fill the ferries with people and not cars. Yes, you will need it reciprocated on the island but A BRT system in Victoria and a spur off the (hopefully built) E&N Railway at duke point could solve that. This line would have a lot of level crossings but I think having larger trains aimed timing the ferries would likely work and not cause too much impact. Personally, I thinkg Alstom Coradia Ilints for this entire project would be a great idea as electrification is cost prohibitive and Hydrogen could be produced locally with our cheap electricity. Who knows, maybe the ferries go hydrogen one day as well. One large flyover would be needed at HWY 17/99 which would not becheap. This would operate as a shuttle line until the Fraser crossing is complete with a O&M facility on TFN land (good jobs in a growing area).

**Phase - 3: Abbotsford Branch**

Pretty simple branch line using the existing crossing. This could be constructed at the same time as the Ferry Line. The frequencies would likely be 30min peak, 1hr off peak but all day. I have this branch going all the way to UFV because I think having all our big mainland universities being different shades of UBC is lame.

**Phase - 4: The Cut**

This gets into the master plan of the whole system. There is currently a plan to bring high speed rail to Vancouver from Seattle which I personally believe should terminate at Pacific Central. This would entail widening the cut to create a future 3-4 track passenger-only right of way. For this phase it would only be adding two tracks to and from Pacific Central. This phase would also connect Port Coquitlam station to the new Braid Station. By this point Translink should have finished the additional station at Albion as well as just finishing up the developments. I think a development right beside a train station that takes you downtown in 40 minutes would sell well but that's just me.

**Phase - 5: Chilliwack Branch**

This Phase would add the extension to central Chilliwack off the mission line that would also be able to be used as a shuttle service between Abbotsford and Chilliwack. I think its safe to say, as with the broadway plan, all of these lines need to come with land use guarantees from each city. Its been way too long of Vancouver (Surrey is trying and New West is ok) being the only city with a true downtown core. Dense development could help Abbotsford and Chilliwack really thrive with cheap real estate and industrial land while people can still feel they can head to the city for a meeting if they have to. 

**Phase - 6: Fraser River Crossing**

What good project in Vancouver doesn't need a bridge (or tunnel). The bridge for this one should be shared with Highspeed Rail eventually so I don't know if it would work in this exact location but it makes sense to me. Essentially the plan would be to use the existing Patullo Bridge foundations for a new bridge span. I haven't done any engineering on them what so ever but it seems like a good idea from afar. This would be the costliest single part of this but it would allow for one seat rides from the ferries to vancouver and maybe a future line to white rock/ south surrey. 

**Phase - technically-not-included-in-this: Vancouver Tram network**

Where do you go other than the expo line when you get out at pacific central? Well if I had any say in it (which I don't) there would be a tram station that stops right out front. It would take you through downtown past some of our most important attractions via transit only streets of Granville and Robson and terminate at Stanley park. Or it would take you along the densely developed False creek south with connections to the Expo Line, Canada Line, and Millennium Line. I included maps of those in the album as a bonus.

This the map as well if you want to take a closer look:

The landlord has offered him a new 1 year lease but with a rent of $2600 ($400 higher than he was paying before).

Since the Acquisition of the Vancouver Aquarium by a for-profit organisation during the pandemic, the livestream was understandably a very low priority. Therefore most communication was denied.

Alright. Thanks to everyone on this thread, and their advice and encouragement, I was able to get to the bottom of this. I got an answer from the rental agency, who finally got a ""satisfying"" response from the property manager. They emailed, and I was in turn forwarded, the Rules, as well as the latest Bylaw Amendments. The board did, in fact, approve of a new bylaw sometime last year, that did what the notices claimed (i.e. ""outlawed"" bringing of bikes inside the building, unless it is to the bike/lockers.)

As it turned out, I was in the wrong (ugh!). Of all of my options, it seemed that leaving my bikes in the locker (as I *do* want to ride them, and *don't* want to pay a ridiculous fine) was the most expedient and least pointlessly combative, if potentially more ""lossy"", sooooo, I'm doing that.

I still hold that the rule is dumb and somewhat silly to pass and enforce, especially given the state of the bike locker and the board's fecklessness in its regard, but I've got a few more months of (fairweather) riding weather, and a few more months on top of that on this coast, so, fuck me, I guess.

I'll leave the post up because of all the good advice that was given on it. Cheers!

# Short version

Strata board member stops me as I'm arriving home after midnight, tells me I can't have my bike in the building, follows me on to my floor and down my hallway with her dog. there is no strata bylaw saying that bikes aren't allowed in the building. bike locker is full and strata has done nothing about it in over a year. building has bad track record of security. there are notices posted around the building saying that there is a $200 fine for bringing bikes in the building despite the fact that no bylaw about it actually exists. please see questions at the bottom.

# Detailed Version

I am going through a property management company (hereon ""rental agency"") to rent a unit in a Vancouver strata building that is managed by another property management company (hereon ""management company""). As a renter, I am one step removed from the strata, to the point that the property manager will not respond to me, and I am told to go through the rental agency. Despite this, when I mentioned, jokingly that I'm treated as a second-class citizen, I ruffled some feathers with a strata member.

When I moved in, I saw a sign that said that bikes are to be locked in the bike locker room on P1, and that they are not allowed in the lobby, the elevators, or hallways. The sign cited a strata bylaw, mentioned a $200 fine, and was signed by the property manager. I looked up the bylaw cited; it mentions nothing about bikes at all and is just a generic ""you are responsible for any damage you cause to common areas of the building"".

Now, the bike room is ""absolutely full"" by even the most generous and creative measures imaginable. The poles are all double or triple-stuffed, and people have just resorted to throwing their bikes in there without actually locking it to anything. Some residents (even some on the strata board) have told me that the ""bike room topic"" has been brought up before and that no action is ever taken. Also, some months ago, the management company posted a note in the elevators about unused bikes being removed, but whatever they did was about 95% ineffective because there has been no real additional space cleared up.

I brought the topic up with the rental agency (essentially, ""what rule forbids me from bringing my bike in? the bike locker is full, is there another bike locker, or a locker for rent? I am going to bring my bike in because I don't feel safe putting my \~$1400 and my \~$600 bikes up in an overloaded bike room with nowhere to lock them""), who asked the property manager in an email, who ignored the questions. This was about 9 months ago. I have two bikes and I keep them in my apartment.

Fast forward to about three weeks ago. I got to the building a few minutes after midnight, fobbed and walked in. A woman who was taking her dog out stops me and does an ""excuse me do you live here"". I say yes and she says that I can't bring my bike into the building. I explain to her that the notice about bikes cited a bylaw that mentioned nothing about bikes, that I have tried to get some answers from the property manager to no avail, and that the notice has since been taken down. She repeats that I'm not allowed to bring my bike into the building. I say okay, and start walking in. She turns around and follows me into the building, asking me what my name and unit number are. I say that I don't have to answer that. She says that she's on the strata board and asks me my unit number again. I say ""that's nice, but I really don't have to answer that"". She says that she can follow me to my unit. I say that I can't stop her from doing that. So she follows me on to the elevator (me (male): 5'9"", slim; she: 6', full-figured, with a large dog). and onto my floor and halfway down my hallway.

I write an email to the rental agency and I copy the property manager about the incident. Again I ask for clarification about the bike rules, and I ask for which bylaw prohibits me from bringing my bike into the building. I don't get a reply from the property manager, but I do see new signs saying that bikes are not allowed in the building (""per the bylaws"" but no mention of which) and that there will be a $200 fine with ""no exceptions"".

I've read the 30-page bylaws document and I can only find two references to bicycles (one mentions ""bicycling"" and the other ""bikes"") and neither prohibits bringing them into the building through hallways, elevators, etc. contrary to the claims made in the posted notices.

The building is in Kits, so there isn't a lot of ""street crime"" so to speak, but there have been break-ins. The building has had to change all of its keys and reprogram its fobs because of a major compromise to their security just a few months ago. This, along with the overflowing bike room, and the fact that I have had a bike stolen from a rented bike spot in the past (different building) makes me not want to keep my bike outside of my apartment. Given that there actually is no bylaw prohibiting me from bringing my bike in the building, I don't think I need to.

# Questions

* What are the strata's fine-issuing (and, I suppose, fine-collecting) powers?
* Do they need to cite a bylaw when they ""charge"" me?
* Should I ""call their bluff"" and just go about my business?
* If I do get a fine, what are my options?
* Why are strata board members so high off of the modicum of perceived power?

&#x200B;

**EDIT** Thanks for all the input. I will

* see what the rental agency tells me (they're looking into it, and someone is coming for an annual inspection on wednesday)
* try and a get a list of current ""rules"" and hopefully minutes to the most recent agm
* go on as usual, even though a part of the pure joy that cycling used to be has been shit on by some sanctimonious and entitled busybody

Ever since this [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/oj12g3/british_columbia_to_provide_regulated_substances/) came out about the BC Provincial Government requiring all health authorities to study safe supply, there has been a lot of talk about the Portuguese model of drug policy and how it is supposedly the best model, or even a panacea, that Vancouver/BC should copy. Meanwhile, it seems like a lot of us know nothing about the Portuguese model and how it actually works there. So I went and did my own research and want to share it here so the discussion can be more informed instead of just slinging epithets at each other or referencing Portugal and walking away. Because I think both sides have justifiable reservations and tenable arguments. I have avoided pulling articles or studies from advocacy NGOs for the purpose of this research, only government and reputable academic studies are reviewed and all sources hyperlinked.   

&#x200B;

# The stats: 

&#x200B;

Portugal and Europe in general have a far lower drug overdose death rate compared to BC.   
Portugal: [**4 deaths per million (2017)**](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/11331/portugal-cdr-2019_0.pdf)  
European average: [**22 deaths per million (2017)**](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/11331/portugal-cdr-2019_0.pdf)  
(Both numbers are pulled from a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, an official EU agency, study)   
Whereas British Columbia: [**303 deaths per million (2017)**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/birth-adoption-death-marriage-and-divorce/deaths/coroners-service/statistical/illicit-drug.pdf).   
(Number pulled from the BC Coroners Service, 2017 is not an outlier and the trend is consistent through to 2021).   


So what's so special about Portugal's policy? 

&#x200B;

# The law in Portugal:

# 

I cannot read Portuguese so I have relied on this [article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24545832.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A857a3257c571aab0f58521908afa8630) published in 2015 in the Law and Social Inquiry, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Bar Association, which is authored by Hannah Laqueur, a professor at UC Davis. The gist of the law is that it is clearly decriminalization, not full-on legalization. And that addicts still can be cited and police enforce drug laws and refer users to the ""Commissions (more on the Commissions below)."" 

She argues that ""(Portugal's) reforms were more modest than suggested by the media attention they received.... **Portugal's Decriminalization Act is not based on a principle of an individual's right to consume drugs free from state intrusion.** **The Act still prohibits drug use subject to citation**."" Further, ""Portuguese drug users were almost never criminally prosecuted before the 2001 reforms, but the decriminalization statute formalized and institutionalized the expectation that problem drug users should receive treatment."" 

In other words, it is important to reiterate that the law ***decriminalizes*** rather than ***legalizes*** drug use. Vancouver's *de facto* reality is that drugs are already decriminalized as this subreddit can testify. If we were to adopt their Decriminalization Act, it would just be formalizing this *de facto* reality. In particular, drug uses can still be subject to citations, and are expected to receive treatment if they are deemed to be high-risk. Vancouver's laissez-faire model is far more liberal in this regard. 

&#x200B;

# The practice in Portugal:

# 

Legislations require supporting regulations and street-level bureaucrats to execute them. How does this Decriminalization Act work in practice and how does it effect the dramatically different drug overdose rates compared to rest of Europe and Canada? 

Here I am relying on a [study](http://www.sicad.pt/BK/Dissuasao/Documents/AS%20report%20GATEWAYS%20FROM%20CRIME%20TO%20HEALTH.pdf) published by SICAD (O Serviço de Intervenção nos Comportamentos Aditivos e nas Dependências) aka the General Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies, a Directorate of the Ministry of Health of Portugal.  

One of the new civil institutions created by the Act are the Commissions for Dissuasions from Drug Abuse (CDTs in Portuguese but I will just call them the Commissions from here). The Commissions have physical locations all over Portugal and they establish panels of three experts (one legal professional, one social worker, one health professional, and/or one case worker). These panels review cases referred to them by the police. 

Now, how did the police get involved? ""In Portugal, people who are found by the police with a defined amount of illicit substances are referred to the Commissions... When a person is found using, buying or in possession of no more than 10 daily doses of illicit substances... and the police have no suspicions or evidence that supply offences are involved, the substance is seized. The police ask to see identification, record the circumstances of apprehension, weigh and identify the substance(s) and produce a report. This includes the date on which the person is required to present themselves to the local (Commission) within 72 hours."" 

In other words, if you are caught buying drugs or in possession of a small amount, the cops take your drugs and send you to the Commissions. This is far from our imagination of Portugal being a place where drug users can just openly and freely use drugs without state intrusion. Rather, you are being referred to the Commissions right away. 

To get people to show up, the Commissions try to set up an appointment, a reminder, and, as a last resort, get the police to ""straight away issue a request of attendance to the hearing.""

&#x200B;

# What power do the Commissions have and what do they do:

Once they are able to get you to show up, the Commissions conduct a long interview to determine your situation, and ultimately rank you based on risk, from low, to medium, to high. Low risk users are given information on prevention and education and can go. Medium risk users receive ""brief motivational intervention"" and referrals. And high risk users receive same plus health referrals. For  medium and high-risk users, on second and subsequent appearances, the Commissions ""are obliged by law to administer a ‘sanction.'""  


>""By law, sanctions can be applied to:   
\- ***problematic users if they refuse treatment***   
\- recreational users on their second (or further) appearance.   
>  
>In such circumstances, the (Commissions) have a range of measures at their disposal. The most commonly used are:   
>  
>\-***Periodic attendance requirements to health centres*** or hospitals for check ups or treatment (including mental health treatment), to social services, employment centres, (vocational) training centres, the CDT itself, the police station etc.   
>  
>Community work (e.g. if the person is not working and has time available).   
>  
>More rarely applied are the following bans:   
\-undertaking certain jobs or tasks   
\-frequenting defined places, areas or people • revocation of licences (e.g. hunting licence).   
>  
>In a minority of cases the management of welfare benefits can be taken over""

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

I think professor Laqueur is right when she said ""(Portugal's) reforms were more modest than suggested by the media attention they received."" If you only hear about the Portuguese miracle in Vancouver (or the Crackdown Podcast) people would have you believe that it is a utopia of progressiveness where no mandatory or coercive bureaucratic power is exercised. This cannot be further from the truth. Users in Portugal experience far more state intrusion compared to Vancouver, we only need to look at the DTSE compared to how the police refer users to the Commissions. In Portugal, decriminalization is meant to lead to treatment and ""dissuasion from drug abuse"" as the name of the Commission for Dissuasions from Drug Abuse has it. 

Portugal's 2001 Act is informed by the Four Pillars Approach and they have excelled at implementing it as the figure in overdose death speaks for itself. Harm reduction is done well, but as are prevention, treatment, and enforcement. Every user is educated and given info when they encounter police. And medium/high risk, recurring users are given ""sanctions"" that are basically forced treatment and enforcement, including taking over welfare benefits and banning addicts from ""frequenting defined places.""

Apparently they would be charged $500/week if we remain past our three year limit.

I work in retail in a mall. Since the pandemic began, it’s been very challenging for us. Trying to operate safely and ensuring our customers are following the rules put in place has been a struggle and I am starting to feel like it’s a losing battle. 


The company I work for has a few stores around the lower mainland, which sometimes requires me to visit to help with operations and training. Each store is located in other malls and I am seeing the same general behaviour in each mall. 


Despite it being April 2021, we still have to explain the rules to people like it’s the first day back after lockdown. A strong portion of people visiting malls are not wearing masks, not social distancing and not following guiding arrows. This is most concerning because malls welcome large gatherings indoors, despite large gatherings being prohibited and we have noticed malls have become busier. We are seeing holiday-type crowds on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and we are expecting even more crowds as we move towards summer since malls are also places where friends and families are gathering, despite being told not to gather indoors. While this may seem good for business, it’s not good in a pandemic. Large crowds are resulting in long lineups outside stores and sometimes these lineups interfere with other stores because they block entrances.


Masks are mandatory in all indoor public settings but people still visit malls without them. Some people only wear masks to enter stores and wander around the concourse maskless. Most of the time, I see security ignoring these people and only confront them in a situation. 


I thought the recent health order to close indoor dining would be beneficial, since the store I mainly work out of is next to a food court but this has resulted in more issues. People are now eating outside stores in the concourse, obstructing some entrances. People are also eating in sitting areas. Again, security ignores it until we phone to have them removed from our entrance. We even catch people in store pulling their masks down to have a bite of their food or have a drink, which goes against our policy: All masks must remain on. 


As the pandemic get worse, I can see malls becoming a breeding ground for Covid-19. I don’t know what the statistics are when it comes to spreading the virus in a mall but from the behaviour I experience, I believe the risk is high. Having been contacted previously a couple of times to let us know someone sick with Covid-19 came into our store firmly makes me believe this. 


A mall is essentially one big building where hundreds of people are employed and welcome additional thousands. With that many people together indoors, surely the virus would spread? 


It’s a big concern being someone who works at a mall, and I hear about it from coworkers almost every shift, and I don’t see a lot of support from mall staff enforcing the rules. While I would hate for malls to be closed down and be out of a job temporarily, I firmly believe malls need to be reevaluated amidst the pandemic and some action needs to be taken to keep everyone safe because we can’t keep expecting the general public to follow the rules.

I am looking for some advise for the current situation with my tenant and hope someone could help me since I haven't got any convincing answers from the RTB.

Here's the story. I rented out my basement a couple of months ago. The guy is on disability and I believe also receives some rent subsidy. Just after 3-4 days of him moved in, his smoke alarm started buzzing. Upon inquiring (SMS) if everything was alright, he got really upset saying I bothered him and didn't let him cook. I told him, it was ok to cook and needed to ask since it could've been a fire emergency. The alarm buzzed a few more times a few days after as well but I knew he was cooking so ignored. I actually setup one day a month for inspection to make sure there are no issues with the plumbing, etc. While I was inspecting, I noticed he took the smoke alarm off. I told him it's a fire violation and in the event of fire, it would be a problem. He said, it was due to the cooking. Ok! 

So, a month later again at a dinner time I heard the smoke alarm, messaged him but received no response. Sensing the emergency, I rushed downstairs and knocked on his door inquiring if everything was alright. He came out, banging on the walls, abusing me with fuck you, fucking fuck, etc. and how I was not letting him cook. He started threatening me, banged the door really hard. Fearing for some form of physical assault, I rushed inside and called the cops. They came and talked to him and advised me to take it with the Tenancy branch.

The very next day I issued him a one month notice for eviction due to endangering health and safety, threatening me, and trying to harm my property. I also quoted in the notice the Police file no. for the call I made. I alongwith my whole family have been in anxiety ever since. He didn't dispute in the due time, and considering it would take the hearing for another 3 months I filed for expedited hearing. 

My question is, if these are the sufficient grounds for eviction? What if the arbitrator sides with him at the hearing? I mean, aren't removing the smoke alarms a violation and a fire hazard already? He has been smoking and using weed in his unit ever since and I had to cover/tape all heat vents since the smoke makes its way to my house upstairs. The dude is an utter trash and harassing us using the other ways (smoking in unit, which I mentioned in my agreement was prohibited and he signed). It's been a hell for me and the whole family that comprised of seniors and a kid. I also gave him an offer to move out early and I would pay him back an extra month of rent along with his deposit. I can't talk to him now due to any chance of verbal/physical retaliation.

Any recourse I have than to wait for a due time for my hearing? Are the chances high that the arbitrator/s side with him since they are mostly favor the tenants? May be not, but I am not sure.

Edit:
1. As the tenant didn’t dispute the one month notice, I filed for the Order of Possession yesterday.

A few thoughts (OK maybe more than a few!)

&#x200B;

December 5, 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dear \[\*The Church congregation, I removed the name\*\], 

&#x200B;

We continue to live through a very unique and trying year and the  challenges we face seem to be only intensifying not diminishing as we  enter into the Christmas season. 

&#x200B;

Let me just say that I wish, more than anything, that for this  Christmas we would be able to gather in person to celebrate and worship  together as the church. I also realize how much I am going to miss  gathering with my extended family (and don’t get me started on the  restrictions for my daughter BLANK and BLANK’s wedding in January ). We are all experiencing a ‘Blue Christmas’ in some way or another this year.

&#x200B;

So while I realize that we are going through a common experience  together, people are handling it in very different ways. This divide is  not between believers and unbelievers, or age groups or even  ethnicities. As I talk to more and more people and observe media and  social media posts\*\*, it has become apparent to me that much of the conflict I see stems from different values being prioritized in people’s lives.\*\*

&#x200B;

These values include public health safety, individual rights, religious  freedoms, mental and emotional wellbeing, protecting the vulnerable,  and economic viability. Most individuals will tell you that each of  these values are important. However, ask a group of people which value  should be the most important right now and should guide our society’s  ability to make decisions with regards to the pandemic and you will get  different answers. An ER doctor might point to health safety; a small  business owner might say economic viability; a parent of young children  might say the mental and emotional wellbeing of their children and a  pastor might say religious freedom. \*\*Leading in a situation where differing values are fighting for the pre-eminent decision making role is very difficult.\*\* Dr. Henry and Minister Dix do not have an easy job.

&#x200B;

Recently, several churches in the Fraser Valley protested the current  health orders by meeting for an in-person worship service. This protest  resulted in a Langley church receiving a fine for violating the orders  and significant backlash on social media which has damaged the church’s  witness to the community. For many Christians, this discussion of  religious freedoms, or more appropriately the erosion of our religious  rights during this pandemic has become an important topic. And it should  be a significant concern for every Christian who lives in a country  that constitutionally protects our religious rights. \*\*But even in our  Charter of Rights and Freedoms, there are provisions during emergencies  of public health that can take precedence over specific freedoms for a  period of time\*\*, which is what we are experiencing currently. 

&#x200B;

So how do we find our way through this values minefield? How do we make  decisions that will both honour God and our civil authorities? \*\*Is there a time when civil disobedience is appropriate for a church to engage in?\*\* These are not easy questions to answer.

&#x200B;

I know that there are many voices speaking into this issue and I am not  sure if my voice will be a helpful addition into the mix but \*\*I wanted to share with you some of the thoughts that have been guiding how I am trying to lead during our current situation\*\*.

&#x200B;

From a biblical perspective, most Christians acknowledge that \*\*the Bible has some clear guidelines in terms of how believers are to interact with civil authorities\*\*.  Both Paul (Romans 13:1-7) and Peter (1 Peter 2:13-14) speak into this  aspect of life. As Christians we are called to submit to our governing  authorities (yes, even pay taxes!) and Paul goes further and says that, “\*whoever  rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has  instituted, and those who do so will bring judgement on themselves.”\*  (Rom 13:2) In essence, when we rebel against those in authority over us  we are rebelling against God’s designed order. I should also point out  that it could be argued that the governing authorities in their day were  more corrupt and opposed to Christianity than our current system, and  yet the early church was asked to submit to these governing authorities.

&#x200B;

Balancing the perspective of submission to authorities is Acts 5:27-29,  where the apostles disobey the Sanhedrin’s orders to stop teaching in  Jesus’ name. Verse 29, “\*We must obey God rather than human beings!\*”  has been an anthem for every reformer since then. Peter and the  apostles demonstrate that there are limits to our obedience to  authorities. I understand this verse to mean that, \*\*if the government  prohibits the church from doing what God commands us to do, or requires  us to do what God has forbidden, then we must obey God rather than man.\*\* 

&#x200B;

This exception clause obviously allows for civil disobedience in certain circumstances, the \*\*hard part is discerning when that disobedience should occur\*\*. I shared an \[article written by Paul Carter\]([https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/columns/ad-fontes/my-threshold-for-civil-disobedience-in-a-covid19-world/](https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/columns/ad-fontes/my-threshold-for-civil-disobedience-in-a-covid19-world/))  with our staff recently that suggested three circumstances that would  provide justification for civil disobedience. I want to share them with  you because I found them helpful.

&#x200B;

1. \*\*If the restrictions obviously and maliciously targeted the church.\*\*If the church was the only institution being targeted by the  restrictions then there would be justification for civil disobedience.  This is simply not the case. Churches, temples, mosques, gurdwaras,  sporting events, movie theatres, and other events have all been targeted  by these health orders. We are not being singled out for restrictions  because we are Christians or because we are religious. But in saying this, I do acknowledge that there is a certain level of  discrimination in the health orders. Schools remain open while churches  do not. Certain businesses, like bars remain open while the church is  asked to meet virtually. I can appreciate how these differences can make  us feel targeted and upset. But I can also see how the values of  economic viability and mental wellbeing have been weighed against public  health safety in the decision to keep these aspects of our society open  and functioning. Although, there are certain aspects of the orders that don’t make sense  to me. For instance, that drive-in and drive-thru events have been  cancelled but you can still go to Costco and fight for a parking spot. **Sometimes submission requires obedience without fully understanding why**, and in some ways this may just be training for following Jesus.There is an area of concern for me with these restrictions and it  centres on the long term ramifications of the current infringement of  our right of religious expression. Will this set a dangerous precedent  for which the government could restrict our rights in the future beyond  public health related issues? This is something that we will have to  stay vigilant against and may even necessitate future legal action.
2. \*\*If the restrictions absolutely and indefinitely forbade gathering for worship.\*\*This for many Christians is the defining issue related to the current  round of restrictions we are being asked to submit too. I think there  are four things to consider when trying to answer this question:a. **Do the restrictions ‘absolutely forbade gathering for worship’?** While the restrictions forbid any sizeable in-person gatherings for  worship, they do not restrict households from worshiping together  in-person. The restrictions also do not forbid virtual gatherings from  occurring either. The truth is that even during the tightest  restrictions we have experienced I have been able to continue to  worship, preach, teach, pray for people, care for people, share my faith  and lead our church. None of my functions have changed, only the form  of how I carry out these functions has changed. But I will say this - I  do prefer some of the pre-pandemic forms! I do prefer worshiping God  with several hundred people instead of just my family (no offence BLANK  and the kids!). I do prefer connecting with people face to face instead  of over zoom or via text. I do miss seeing my larger church family every  week. **But just because many of the ways I** ***prefer*** \*\*to experience church cannot be done right now does not mean I should disobey the authorities.\*\*b. **Are worship gatherings indefinitely forbidden?** The answer to this is no, although it certainly feels like it  sometimes. As we have seen over the past 9 months, Dr. Henry has changed  the parameters on gatherings based on the impact that Covid19 is having  in our province. Currently we are under the tightest restrictions of  the pandemic and I foresee these tight restrictions extending into the  New Year. But I do believe that at some point in 2021 we will return to  being able to meet for worship without size restrictions  c. \*\*What about that verse in Hebrews?\*\*Hebrews 10:25, which says, “*not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing*”  is a current proof text that many believers are using to justify their  civil disobedience. I would agree that it is spiritually unhealthy for a  believer to get out of the habit of worshiping with other believers.  That is why ‘Celebrate Big’ is one of our five discipleship rhythms at  BLANK. But we also need to realize that ‘where two or three are  gathered’ God is there. So even in the smallest of gatherings God is  present and we can worship him in a smaller corporate sense. But does Hebrew 10:25 really apply to our current situation? I actually  don’t think it does. The context of the verse is clearly addressing the  person who voluntarily stops showing up to worship with other  believers. I believe the correct application of this verse in our  current setting would be an admonition for those believers who are not  participating in our online church services, or online small groups, or  gathering with their household to worship each week.  d. \*\*Are there other aspects to consider?\*\*One of my own struggles in all of this is my desire for my own rights  to take precedence (I really do not enjoy wearing a mask!) but if I  consider the tone and direction of the New Testament, we are not  encouraged to fight for our rights, in fact the opposite is true. **We are to lay down our preferences, wants, and even our lives for others.** We  are to be self-sacrificing and humbly put others before ourselves so  that we may fulfill the commandment of loving our neighbour. We need to  be willing to give up what we feel we have a right to for the wellbeing  of others.One other aspect to consider in this discussion is **what civil disobedience will do to our witness as a church** in  the greater community. When the majority of our society views this  pandemic as a public health issue and therefore believes safety is of  paramount importance, people gathering together in defiance of public  orders is seen as reckless and dangerous.        
3. \*\*If the restrictions appeared not to have been made in good faith.\*\*The restrictions that have been imposed on us are in the interests of  slowing down the spread of the virus and to try and ensure that our  health care system is not overwhelmed. If this is not the case (and  please don’t send me your conspiracy theories) then I think we may need  to consider civil disobedience. At this time, there does not seem to be  any credible evidence that this isn’t a public health emergency. I have been privileged enough to be on several town hall calls with Dr.  Bonnie Henry, Minister Dix and the Premier during this pandemic. I  believe that our leaders are taking action in ‘good faith’. They are  trying to hear the concerns of the faith community, but they are also  trying to balance competing values as well as politics of course.  Repeatedly, Dr. Henry has emphasized how important faith communities are  during this incredibly difficult time and how she is looking forward to  the time when these orders will no longer be needed.    

**So what does this mean?**

As you may be able to discern, I don’t believe our church should at  this time be meeting in violation of the public health orders. Since  this pandemic started back in March, I have repeatedly shared that I  would be leading our church to obey the orders given by the health  officer and my position has not changed during the latest round of  orders.  Our church governing board met last week and I discussed the  current restrictions with the board, including many of the points I have  expressed in this article and the board agreed that we shouldn’t be  meeting during this time. I need to add that the thoughts I have  expressed in this article, are my thoughts and don’t express any  official position of our board. 

&#x200B;

I know that not everyone in our church will share my position in these  matters. However, I think it is especially important during times like  these that we are able to show grace to each other when we disagree. We  have to continue to strive for unity during these difficult times. 

&#x200B;

We may not be able to meet in-person right now, but that does not mean  we stop being the church. I have been really proud of our staff and  ministry leaders as we have pivoted multiple times these past 9 months.  We continue to find new ways to live out the mission of the church. 

&#x200B;

Let me end with three things that I think we should be doing right now:

&#x200B;

1. Regularly praying for our leaders – especially Dr. Henry and Minister Dix
2. Praying for an end to this pandemic
3. Continuing to be the church – caring for people, sharing our faith, being a light in a world that so desperately needs Jesus. ",vancouver,"In light of the protests and subsequent fining of a group of churches in largely for disobeying covid orders, I thought I might share this email that was sent to a congregation that I am involved in.

Anywho thanks for reading


*edit*  here is my story for all those that are inquiring 


Basically, over the summer I was driving my friends and I to a hiking spot 2 hours out of town. I had the car on cruise control (at 100km/hr, the highway speed limit) and I was catching up to the person in front of me pretty quickly. There was a passing lane so I merged into it. I passed the slower vehicles and then noticed the passing lane ending sign (i missed the one that said lane ends in X amount of meters). Unfortunately there was a line up of cars behind me but only 1 truck in front of me. Instead of risking the dreaded merge at highway speed, I floored it and quickly passed the truck right as the lane was ending. Just my luck, a cop drove by and only saw the aftermath of me zooming past the truck. Then I got pulled over, got 1 speeding ticket and 1 ticket for over passengering as I only have my ""N"". 

Those were my first police issued tickets (I've had a few parking tickets before), so I think that might be a mitigating factor. As well as the point that I was speeding for safety reasons, not trying to race or impress anyone. 

As for overpassenging, I don't really have a valid excuse for that, other than my friends can't drive and I didn't want to disclude anybody, nor did I want to drive them to the hiking location one at a time. That would take an additional four hours to get there and then another four hours back.",vancouver,~ICBC Inquiry ~,0.26,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/jvoq9t/icbc_inquiry/

In a strata complex with no age restrictions, can the strata pass a rule prohibiting all children (including the children of owners/residents) from using the pool for much of the day?


We have been having an ongoing disagreement with our strata and are hoping someone can help point us in the right direction. My husband and I purchased our unit pre-sale in a development with a pool when we were a young couple. We knew that we would be starting a family eventually, so obviously we made sure to purchase in a development with no age restrictions. 


Several years ago a rule was passed prohibiting children from using the pool except during the hours of 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm. My husband and I were not pleased, but since we didn’t have children at the time we couldn’t exactly argue that the rule was unfair to us, so we kept quiet.


After our first child was born, we (as well as other owners with children) wrote to the strata several times asking that the rule be struck due to its unfairness. During a Q&A session that took place prior to the upcoming AGM, the strata president assured us that the rule would either be struck entirely, or amended to state that it applied only to children who were visiting, and not to those who resided in the complex.


Unfortunately - and to our shock - the strata went back on their word and when we received the AGM package we saw that our only option was to vote to keep the rule as is (with children only being allowed in the pool from 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm), or to amend it to now prohibit children from using the pool except from the hours of 10:00 am to 1:00 pm and after 4:00 pm. We were not even given the option of voting to have the rule struck.


Over the years more and more seniors have moved into the complex and now greatly outnumber the families here. While the majority of the seniors are lovely, there is a small group of “senior bullies” who do not feel that families with children should live here and do their best to make us feel unwelcome. Ironically, having purchased pre-sale, my husband and I have lived here for far longer than these new residents who feel that we should not be here. 


We never would have purchased in a complex that heavily restricted our (future) children from using the pool and don’t see how a rule that blatantly caters to one group of owners at the expense of another can even be enforceable, regardless of the fact that it was voted in by the childless majority. Sadly most of the other families with kids have since “taken the hint” and sold their homes and moved out, however we are on a budget and selling and moving do not come without considerable expense, and furthermore we (otherwise) like where we live and don’t feel like we should be bullied out of our home just because we had children.


Is this something that would be worth taking to the Civil Resolution Tribunal? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if the advice is that we need to just suck it up and deal with this rule because there is nothing we can do.

I want to start off by saying that I have a family member who currently works for Service Canada and I have confirmed everything before posting this. I felt compelled to write this as I see many people purposely spreading misinformation about EI/CERB. Especially on the new EICERB subreddit, I'm convinced a certain someone is using multiple accounts to spread misinformation (pretty obvious when skimming their post/comment history) and I want to warn everyone. Whenever I see a post about EI/CERB I always notice a large chunk of angry individuals wrongfully trying to scare them with misinformation.

Some quick points, based on what I've seen on reddit:

\- YES you can voluntary quit/refuse to go back to your job and STILL receive/be eligible for EI/CERB (under certain circumstances). Point being if your employer recalls you to work, IT HAS TO BE REASONABLE or you can lawfully refuse.

\- There is a extensive list of reasons why you can voluntary quit/leave your job and still be eligible for EI/CERB. I will post the complete list below but some common reasons (from what I've observed on reddit) can include: your employer is reducing your hours/salary significantly (wages–unjustified reduction), working conditions–significant unilateral changes (duties, hours of work, wages, responsibilities), working conditions–unreasonable, if your employer is harassing you, obligation to care for a child or a member of the immediate family, someone you live with is immune compromised, workplace is not safe, ETC.

\- If your employer amends your ROE to fired or quit (or threatens to) - you can still receive EI/CERB, if you have a reasonable reason to refuse, Service Canada will reverse it.

\- Talk with a Service Canada agent if you are not entirely sure, not reddit!

\- A large number of employers/business owners are annoyed with EI/CERB and also those who are still forced to be working, which is where alot of anger is coming from. Honestly just ignore them.

\- There are employers out there taking advantage of people, for example, they are eliminating the employees old job title and creating a new bogus one with way less pay and then recalling them, another example includes how some employers are recalling positions like Server/Bartenders to come back as Hosts or Line Cooks to come back as dishwashers or managers to come back to serve (none of which is allowed unless you explicitly agree). Employers are falsely threatening to amend employees ROE's or cut off their benefits if they don't oblige. This can also be considered harassment if they continue to threaten you.

\- DO NOT RETURN UNLESS IT IS THE EXACT SAME JOB/PAY AS BEFORE. Although MINIMAL changes to pay do not count. Even if it is the same job and you don't like it, all you have to do is find another job.

This is Canada, not some third world country, Service Canada is here to protect you!

I moved to Vancouver from SK last summer but I haven't changed my plate until I got the ticket.. I changed my plate to BC and nothing went wrong whether from ICBC or the broker, and I will cancel my SK registration and insurance right away -- my question is, if I am not paying this parking ticket, is there a way for the City of Vancouver to track me down and send me to collection agency to start bugging me and eventually affect my credit?

Edit: To put in more detail, I was rushing to the washroom after parked behind the No Parking during 3-7pm sign which I thought would be safe for just 2 minutes, and unfortunately an office fishing nearby caught me on the spot and did not listen to my explanation. It would have been a different scenario if there was someone else in the car with me and had the harzardous lights on. The street was not busy at all and there was another car parked right after me but it got out because the driver was inside.

And it was a whopping $120 ticket. I get why most of you were upset about me breaking the law, and I will pay for it and take it as a life lesson. I am just hoping you would not feel wronged if you run into the same situation and kindly accept the ticket when you are already leaving and the officer still ruthlessly handed you the ticket without mercy and emphathy. And don't cry over a ticket for running 2 minutes late after the meter expired. We all know rules are rules, but rules are made and enforced by people, they don't work like numbers do they?

Reading the threads about the new gun laws made me realize there are a lot of people talking past each other about firearm regulations, and that some people don't realize how prevalent firearms are and how many people in Vancouver have PALs (possession and acquisition licence)

In Canada, there is a licensing system in place for people who want to own firearms. Furthermore, a firearm that was bought legally by a licenced individual cannot be given, sold, or lent to anyone who doesn't have the right licence. 

Firearms are placed in 3 categories, each of which have separate licencing requirements: non restricted, restricted, and prohibited. (there are no firearms that can be purchased without a licence)

Non restricted is things like hunting rifles and shotguns, basically long guns that can't be easily concealed. A non-restricted possession and acquisition licence (PAL) requires passing a training course with a written and practical test at the end. 

Restricted is some rifles (like AR 15) and all handguns. The licencing requirement is having a non-restricted PAL, plus doing another course+tests to show you can safely handle and store restricted firearms (RPAL). Restricted firearms can only be used at the range, there is no other acceptable use for them, and in order to purchase one you need to show proof that you have a range membership. 

They are also registered to the individual owner, can only be transported between the home and the range/gunsmith, and have to be stored unloaded and in a locked container designed for that purpose.

Prohibited is a big category, including things like rifles with cut down barrels, a bunch of models of handguns, certain rifles, and any firearm that is capable of or easily modified to be automatic fire. (Automatic fire means that you pull the trigger once and it keeps firing; semi automatic is 1 pull= 1 round). There are zero civilians in Canada who can legally purchase ""assault rifles"" that are capable of automatic fire. 

Prohibited licences aren't really a thing the average person can get, and any firearms that are owned under a prohibited license cannot be used even at range. 

Rifles, whether restricted or non restricted, are limited to 5 round magazines. It is illegal to have more, so ""high capacity magazines"" aren't a thing here to begin with. Neither are ""assault weapons"", if assault= automatic.

To get a licence, you have to do the course, submit an application to the RCMP, and wait at least a month - there's no immediate approval, or spur of the moment ability to purchase. They do a background check (and keep doing daily checks after a licence has been issued), and contact people around you including past and present spouses.

So I live in a shared house. I've been renting for one month now, and the landlord has been really eccentric. She comes in frequently to check whether the dishes/garbage are clean, alcohol or male guests are strictly prohibited, and insists that I pay in cash only. I put up with it because it's a good location for a good price. Important: she does not live in the unit, there are other roommates who rent directly from her. She lives really close by though, and comes by at least once a week. 

Since I just stay in the living room separated by a room divider, I didn't think I was entitled a 24 hour notice in the situation, so I didn't say anything.

My rent was due on the 15th, but because I've been too sick to go to the bank (since she insists cash) I asked her to defer, and she said yes. Today, she called me and said that my room is very messy, I used the fireplace (even though I only lit candles in it), and says the place has rats now because I left dishes on my bed (though I doubt leaving a couple plates overnight is enough to cause an infestation). 

She said I have one week to leave over a phone call. I messaged her over Facebook telling her to give me a one month notice, but shes repeatedly says she doesn't like bothering with the ""formal stuff""

(a)prohibiting pets, or restricting the size, kind or number of pets a tenant may keep on the residential property

The term pet is never actually defined anywhere in the act, but generally, a pet is defined as something like 'an animal kept for pleasure, not for commercial purposes.'

- I have a full BC license and i use my Android phone's google maps for 1) directions, and 2) traffic alerts, and 3) speed camera alerts.  I often do trips to unfamiliar parts of BC, including but not limited to Greater Vancouver.

- I mount my phone via my **air-vent magnetic mount**, because 1) it's perfectly eye level, and does not cover up my windshield, and 2) it cools my overheated phone via my AC.  

- lastly i NEVER ever touch my phone while driving, ever.

1) i was searching and [found this BC govt webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/driving-and-transportation/driving/publications/electronic-devices-while-driving.pdf) that talks about ""handheld communication device"" vs ""GPS device"", but unfortunately it doesn't clarify the legality of mounting your smartphone for GPS map guidance.

2) and then i found this [old thread on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/8l8igz/distracted_driving_psa/) whose OP that claims **even air-vent mounted phones are prohibited & ticketed.**  :(

3) but THEN i found this post by a Victoria PD officer, [suggesting that it's ok](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/8r3jui/are_we_allowed_to_use_google_maps_on_our_phone_in/e0q2ybs/), so long as phone is mounted & you're ""not physically interacting"" with it.   yay!

4) and then there's the happiest news of all: BC supreme court recently ruled that a phone being ""within sight"" is insufficient proof of distracted driving ticket.  [This CBC article explains:](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/distracted-driving-ruling-loose-phones-1.5064378) 

> The case came up when a B.C. driver was given a hefty ticket for distracted driving because his phone was wedged in the passenger seat, even though he wasn't touching it.

> The driver lost in traffic court but appealed. The B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled in his favour.

> ""Some justices were saying that you had to have it affixed to the vehicle, some were saying loose in the vehicle is totally fine. Police officers were inconsistently enforcing [distracted driving rules].""

> A spokesperson with the B.C. RCMP's traffic services acknowledged the decision and said distracted driving tickets will be handed out to drivers who are ""using"" their phone — which no longer includes only having it visible in the car.

> According to ICBC, phones have to be in a fixed location and in hands-free mode. They also must be able to be activated or deactivated with a single touch. But, Lee said, that's only if the phone is actually being used or touched. ""You just need to make sure that you actually leave the phone alone and you keep your eyes on the road,"" Lee told CBC's The Early Edition.

He made a great first impression: he was friendly, knowledgeable, patiently explained various options, and his quote was very competitive. Nevertheless I went through the due diligence steps listed below and it’s a good thing I did: this guy is a long-time con man with a penchant for taking large cash deposits from unsuspecting clients then never finishing the work (assuming he ever started). Over the past 15 years, he’s been sued 10+ times in various locales in BC and has been convicted of 10+ offenses, including two counts of Mischief under $5000, three counts of Theft under $5000, Assault, Assault with a Weapon, many “Failures to Appear” and six counts of driving while prohibited. 


The humbling part for me was that my Spidey senses didn’t go off when dealing with him. At all. But given his legal history, it’s clear I’m not the only one who fell for his nice guy act. 


Let’s say you’re thinking of hiring a local contractor in BC by the name of “Donald Trump” to build you a wall. Here’s some steps you can take to try to ferret out whether you’re dealing with a crook: 


1.	Make sure to get his first and last name. Not providing a surname may be an evasive maneuver to thwart legal proceedings and you’re going to need it for the steps below. 

2.	Obviously, run a Google search of the company name and/or the person’s name, to find customer reviews. 

3.	Ask for references.

4.	Check the Better Business Bureau for complaints. 

5.	Check to see if he’s been sued on CSO (Court Services Online). Go to [Court Services Online]( https://justice.gov.bc.ca/cso/index.do), and click on “Search Civil” to check for any civil proceedings associated with the name. 

6.	Check CSO to see if he’s been charged with any offences. Go to [Court Services Online]( https://justice.gov.bc.ca/cso/index.do), and click on “Search Traffic/Civil” to see if the name appears. The record will confirm what the person is charged with and if they were convicted or acquitted. 

7.	Go to the [BC Judgments website]( https://www.bccourts.ca/search_judgments.aspx?court=0) and enter his surname under “Case Name” and his first name under “Key Words”. While unlikely, you might find a written decision involving your would-be contractor acting less than angelic. 


A few closing comments. First, CSO only provides basic details for free. You’d have to pay for access to the files if you want specifics. Second, be careful about identifying the person: while searching for “Donald Trump” the search results may include a “Donald J Trump” as well as a “Donald K Trump.” You don’t want to find yourself falsely accusing anyone (CSO lists birthdates and full legal names to help with identification). Third, everyone is presumed innocent until they are found guilty or liable. Finally, I’m not saying that any person with a legal history is unworthy of being hired, only that taking these steps might uncover, as I did, a truly bad actor. 


Happy trails.

EDIT TO ADD: 


There's been several negative comments about the Better Business Bureau and I agree it's essentially useless in seeking a remedy. However, it is WELL worth your time spending a few seconds searching the BBB site. In my case, the guy had a very negative review outlining how the client sued him in Small Claims. 


Ask for proof that the workers are protected by WCB insurance. If a worker is injured while working on your property you could be liable. 


Here's a ""next level"" approach of searching online pointed out by u/TomKeddie. Not only should you search the business and/or person's name, but also information that might not change even if the business name does, things like email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses.

You could also try broadening your search of reported court decisions beyond BC to other jurisdictions in Canada including all of them if you wish.

I thought it might be interesting to provide an update on our extreme case given the ongoing interest and the new $1000/day fine legislation coming into effect on November 30th.

The TL;DR update is that business is booming!

After my post, /u/secrets7 kindly worked some contacts at AirBnB and got my neighbor banned from the site. Business slowed for a month or so and then resumed in earnest – traffic was as high as or higher than ever. We discovered that the property was now being listed on Booking.com.

We contacted Booking.com and they were surprisingly responsive. We were able to get through to a person, present our evidence and get our neighbor banned from the site. Again, business slowed for a while and then resumed. It turns out that my neighbor was back on AirBnB and that the prior ban wasn’t a ban at all. Either it was a temporary suspension or my neighbor managed to convince AirBnB that the ban was inappropriate – I have no idea but they were back online and operating at scale.

While this was going on, our Strata pursued and won a judgement against the owner at the Civil Resolution Tribunal in September 2017. The owner attempted to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court but the request was denied and after months of back-and-forth legal process, the CRT order was finally registered into force at the Supreme Court in June 2018. The owner doesn’t seem to care and has no apparent intention to comply. They continue to operate in contempt of that order.

Amazingly, my neighbor's response to this loss in court was to escalate their activity! In addition to listing on AirBnB, they managed to get back online at Booking.com somehow. We also found the property listed on HostelWorld.com and various other short term accommodation and couch surfing sites. We managed to get in contact with people at both Booking.com (again) and HostelWorld.com quite easily. They took our claims seriously, reviewed our evidence and have subsequently banned our neighbor. Kudos to them. AirBnB… Not so much.

You can still find the property on Google Maps and it even has its own website! The online booking function in both cases appears to be powered by Booking.com and is therefore non-functional.

As to AirBnB, like I say, business is booming. AirBnB is the granddaddy in the space and it alone appears to direct plenty of business to my neighbor. It seems to me that my neighbor likes to to cycle through profiles to mask their activity and maybe ""get a fresh start"" on reviews but they're easy to find. They've got 12 beds up on offer now in 4 listings.

One of my biggest complaints during this whole ordeal is that AirBnB is a ghost when it comes to complaints. They don’t provide any meaningful mechanism to complain or present evidence and there's no way to talk to a person with authority. When you do use what tools they offer, they turn you away with platitudes, generic claims about their commitment to community and direct you to talk to your neighbor or local authorities. Hello… I think our neighbor knows about our complaints – we sued and won. AirBnB won’t even enforce their own ToS. They just don't want to hear it from you. It’s incredibly frustrating.

Insofar as carrying forward with the legal battle, our Strata is burdened by the legal expenses we’ve incurred thus far and hasn’t made any attempts to enforce our judgement (aside from registering a lien on the property) because of those costs. We’ve spent 25K and our lawyer says it might be another 25K to go back to court to try to prove the contempt and enforce. Even then, my understanding is that the enforcement isn’t likely to be more than a slap on the wrist, so a high price to pay for an inconsequential outcome.

I know some people will ask about the City of North Vancouver and I won’t talk about that because my knowledge is limited. I do believe they’re doing whatever they’re legally able to do. Unfortunately, that’s not much, it takes forever and it all has to go through the courts too. What are they going to do? Add an injunction to the pile?

So, what do we do now?

We’ve spent almost 2 years and big bucks dealing with this neighbor and going through the legal process to get them to stop but they just shrug it off. This person is taking advantage of their neighbors, the City, the legal system and of unsuspecting travelers as well.

What’s the point of bylaws, laws, licenses, courts or any of the rules/process that we live by if all it takes is for one bad faith actor to simply ignore them? Our neighbor has their own rules and so far it seems like they’re the only ones that matter, and anyone who disagrees had better have a serious bankroll. What does it take to actually get someone to stop doing something that’s prohibited but not criminal and why does it cost a fortune?

S7500,,1531554997,,False,8yrqb1,False,True,t3_8yrqb1,45,False,/r/vancouver/comments/8yrqb1/why_is_icbc_screwing_me/,0,"Just thought I'd speak out here about my situation. 

So I had accumulated a few points on my drivers license. I received a suspension which was 4 months. At the time I was working two jobs and couldn't afford to lose my license. I sent in a letter to ICBC explaining why I couldn't afford to lose my license. The letter cost me $100 to send. They went ahead with the suspension regardless. I accepted the suspension and gave in my license. A situation occurred during the 4 months where I had to quickly jump into the car (Stupid decision on my part) and drive a few blocks away from my house. I got pulled over and they impounded the car and gave me a court date, which I had to show up for in court. The original 4 month suspension had ended and I reinstated my license and began to drive again. Now my new court date was just around the corner. I decided to hire a lawyer. In front of the judge my lawyer brought down the new suspension from 12 months to 3 months with a $1000 fine that I had been given 9 months to pay. That same day in court, I needed to sign a few papers stating that my license is suspended until (date after 3 months). The person standing across from the desk explained everything I was signing. He then asked if I have my drivers license ID with me and gave me the choice of handing it over to him or if I don't have it with me, thats alright as well but just know that it's invalid during my suspension. I told him I don't have it with me because I had left it at home. 

Now was the time I had to pay my lawyer for his duties of reducing the time of my suspension. I paid him $3000. 

3 Months had gone by now and I could finally drive. I took that drivers license that I did not hand over 3 months ago and put it into my wallet and began driving. I was driving for about 2 months now and I got pulled over because of a random plate check. The policeman told me that his computer shows that I am driving while prohibited. I explained to the policeman that I had gone through with my 3 month suspension and it should be fine now. His only response was that his computer says I am prohibited so he has no choice but to impound my car for 7 days and take my drivers license ID. I was confused and called my lawyer right away. He explained that I was suppose to reinstate my license as soon as the 3 months had gone by. (Lawyer should have been the one to tell me that right away. Yes I know, horrible lawyer). So the policeman took my drivers license ID and told me to figure stuff out with ICBC. 

I rushed to ICBC as soon as my car was taken away by the tow truck and told them I'd like to reinstate my license. They asked for $250. I paid them and they gave me a yellow piece of paper which says I could drive and they assured me that I would receive my actual drivers license ID in the mail in a few weeks. 

I work early mornings. I live in Vancouver but my commute is a long way to Surrey for work. I realized I needed to rent a car for the 7 days. I am 24 years old, so with the underage fees, my total cost for the rental car came to roughly $700.

The 7 days had gone by now and I returned the rental car and took a taxi to the tow yard. I showed them the yellow piece of paper that was my temporary drivers license I received from ICBC. I got the car out and they charged me $387 for the 7 days they held the car there.

So now I had been driving my car to work everyday and 5 weeks had gone by since I reinstated my license and received the yellow paper. Still waiting for my actual ID to come in the mail. 

I get pulled over.

The policeman says I am driving while prohibited......again. ""Are you kidding me?!""

I explained my entire situation. 

ICBC gave me my yellow piece of paper which clearly says this is my temporary drivers license and allows me to drive. They understood what I was trying to get across but they said they had no choice because their computer system says that I am driving while prohibited. They even called ICBC for me and double checked with them and ICBC told them nope his license is prohibited. They had no choice but to impound my car for 7 days (which I will have to pay for again). This was Friday night. I had work Saturday early morning and also Sunday early morning. I had to call in sick for both of those shifts because I had no way of getting to work. Now I am waiting for Monday morning which is my day off so I can speak with a different lawyer that can help me with this situation. I will possibly have to rent another car for me to get to work because there is no transit that can take me to my work at the times my shifts start.

This is ridiculous. 

A couple things I don't understand: 

1). I had signed the papers in court stating my license was suspended for only 3 months. So why is their computer system still saying I am suspended?

2). If my license was still suspended, why did ICBC give me the yellow paper when I reinstated my license? ICBC is pretty much telling me yes go drive and then I get pulled over to only find out my license is suspended? 

I have spent so much money trying to clear this up and it feels like a repeated cycle. I want to spread my story out to everywhere possible. I will be contacting global news and CTV news and hope they can help me spread this message. I will be talking with another lawyer and hoping this clears up and I get reimbursed for everything I've paid from my pocket towards my tows, car rentals and ICBC.

Mainly, I guess, because I'm new in town and still lacking any resource or support network, and I do have a bit of a problem on my hands.

Some background: I moved here with my spouse last year. In what now seems like a foolhardy gamble, we gave ourselves a two-week window to find an apartment, and in fact we did find one with surprising ease. Inevitably it came with a hitch.

Our landlord seemed merely negligent at first, taking, for example, several weeks to install a laundry machine that supposedly came with the unit. Then things took a turn for the darker. The long-term tenants of our building gradually disappeared until our unit was the only one (out of four) that wasn't an AirBnb. The landlord themselves (being a strange association of three or more people) remained negligent as before, even as other and worse problems presented themselves, and this became compounded by the revolving door of AirBnb lodgers who really didn't give a fuck. The landlord themselves live nowhere nearby so there was nothing resembling oversight, just the maintenance performed between bookings by someone who appears to be subcontracted (as we've never dealt with them in any capacity).

My spouse is a strong-willed individual and not one to tolerate a slight, so she's consistently held the landlords to account (politely, but firmly) and threatened to take things to dispute resolution when we absolutely couldn't get an answer otherwise. We eventually learned that their AirBnb operation wasn't being run quite consistently with the law, and reported them. Unfortunately this sparked a nearly instant retaliation; we were accused of certain behaviour that is prohibited by neither the lease nor the law, and told that this was grounds for our eviction. We knew that this had no legal force, so we stuck around, to apartment-hunt at our leisure. But needless to say, it is an uncomfortable situation. The landlords are raging against their legal impotence by being rude and borderline threatening (""we hope we can end this painlessly"" being one line, in classic mafia fashion).

What it's all been building up to is this: after some months of making our best effort, we have proved completely unable to get an apartment on this go-round. What is no doubt a major factor is that we can't list our current landlord as a reference, and it turns out that prospective renters in Vancouver are vetted more fully than presidential candidates in the U.S.A. We are, effectively, being penalized for our landlord's shittiness.

So my questions, in brief: what recourse do you have when your semi-criminal landlord is the one responsible for the falling out? What ways are there, if any, to circumvent the extremely rigorous background check that is seemingly required to rent any lousy studio apartment? What tips and tricks are essential to netting a place other than the obvious professional references, etc.?

YIMBYVancouver,,1526351769,,False,8ji4r0,False,True,t3_8ji4r0,41,False,/r/vancouver/comments/8ji4r0/yimby_manifesto_why_vancouver_needs_a/,0,"Hello /r/Vancouver, 

Below is a manifesto I have written for why Vancouver needs to organize a housing-based political party.   This manifesto seeks to inspire others, to generate discussion and to get people thinking.  It echoes off the anger of movements like *#DontHave1Million* and *#HALTYVR*, arguing that we must take a stand against zoning laws that strangle the creation of diverse, affordable housing around Single Family Home (SFH) areas.

**The YIMBY manifesto**

The term ""YIMBY"" stands for Yes In My BackYard, a response to anti-development people nicknamed NIMBY's (Not In 
My Backyard).  The ""YIMBY movement"" is neither a left nor right movement.  The inspiration for this manifesto came from San Francisco's [BARF -- the Bay Area Renters Federation.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html?_r=0)  The NY Times summed up their thinking as:

>[BARF] Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.

>[BARF] supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. “You have to support building, even when it’s a type of building you hate,” she said. “Is it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.”

YIMBY shares the spirit of BARF, but with a Vancouver flavour.  We are in a crisis and we will not get out of it by limiting the expansion of development.  Nor will we get out of it by just caving into developer demands and not ending zoning laws that limit the construction of flexible higher density houses (like duplexes, townhouses, apartments etc).

In Vancouver, the YIMBY Manifesto's primary rally cry is the concern that 95 per cent of Canadian families can not afford to buy a single family home (SFH) in Vancouver, while single family home zoned areas in Vancouver make up 80% of its land area.  Put another way, the top 5% of families are now on an alignment to ""own"" (eventually) 80% of Vancouver's land.  YIMBY believes this core injustice perpetuated by zoning laws working against the interests of the broader public needs to end.  

NPA / Vision / Green can never take the actions that are needed to help younger generations on this issue, due to the intractable conflicts of interests they have with SFH-owning members of society.  Their politics will always invoke an attempt to find balance in ways that privilege home equity values.  If newer generations want to find effective advocates for their interests on this issue, they need to make it clear they are willing to break with older progressive and conservative allies to align together a new coalition that's focused primary *on their economic interests, not those of SFH home owners.*

Because NIMBY (Not In My BackYard) forces among SFH neighbourhoods hold very strong political sway over individual rezoning decisions, including even among traditionally ""progressive"" parties like Vision or Green.  The YIMBY manifesto proposes fighting their strong influence by targeting the system from a higher level by advocating for a bold, proverbial *ripping of the band aid* reform of all zoning laws that limit single family houses from higher density all in one go, where ever possible.  This approach would move the City of Vancouver away from the current wishy-washy incrementalism that has paralyzed effective action on housing affordability.

In most zoning battles, home owners can effectively win as ""NIMBY's"" within zoning battles because renters don't show up to fight these battles.  We believe a city election could be different.  If a battle over zoning philosophy is fought during a city election as the party's primary issue, we create a way for the large vocal interests of non-SFH owning and renting people to gain back their voice.  Home owners who fight against electing YIMBY's with fierce intensity may be shocked to learn just how much built up anger and resentment exists out among those who have had enough with *SFH-privilege.*  These *non-SFH owning* voters are the silent majority, the silent guardians of housing affordability who can make the YIMBY party possible.

**The YIMBY Identity**

A YIMBY political party if created in Vancouver will not function as a regular political party, but more as an organized movement.  Neither left, nor right -- it is for the renters, the dispossessed, the homeless, those who missed out on the single family home lottery, and those who just want a reason to tell the existing order *to go fuck themselves.*

In some ways... it's a Trumpian effort -- minus the bigotry, ignorance and racism -- to #DrainTheSwamp of all of our pathetically ineffective politicians who have gleefully stood by as our city has hollowed itself out.

In other ways, it's a way for new generations to express their anger in highly tangible and effective way: a way for Gen Y and Gen X'ers to truly assert their grievances as many did with Bernie Sanders campaign during the Democratic Primary.

This movement is *screaming protest* against the status quo insanity those with property have subjected on us in Vancouver.  We watch as Gregor feigns sadness about the plight of renters, while gleefully profiting off his own home equity rising.  YIMBY seeks to redefine political norms in ways that shock those among Vancouver's political class.

**Vision, NPA and Green fuck over younger generations**

This manifesto argues a YIMBY-style party is necessary due to the inherent electoral dynamics of how city councils respond to issues of zoning.

The YIMBY is the only party that can fight consistently for the interests of renters.  Unlike NPA / Vision / Green, a YIMBY party is under no pressure to submit to the complaints of SFH owners.  Unlike these parties, YIMBY *will take a side* on these issues in a way that other parties won't.  YIMBY *will not* fiddle *while Vancouver burns* because we know what we want and we will do what it takes to get it.  

**Vancouver issues viewed by a YIMBY**

- YIMBY-ers *will not* mortgage the wellbeing of future generations to protect the paper millionaire profits of those who made wealth through no particular skill or agency of their own.

- YIMBY-ers will reject as a false equivalence anyone who tries to argue that the wellbeing of Kitsilano residents losing a downtown view corridor could ever take precedence over the problem of renters not being able to find a shoebox to rent from downtown in buildings that have had their heights capped. 

- YIMBY-ers know that the choices forced upon them between single family homes and condo shoeboxes are *false dichotomies* created by our leaders craven political inability to allow any [middle housing options](http://imgur.com/R5fhwsM) within SFH suburbs.

- YIMBY'ers know it is *not normal* [for 95 per cent of Canadian families to be priced out of being able to buy a single family home in Vancouver](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/11/21/vancouver-should-prohibit-single-family-home-construction.html), while those land masses within Vancouver occupy 4/5ths of the city's land space. 


**Our Platform: 1 Promise**

The YIMBY campaign platform centers around one concrete platform promise:

>To abolish any and all zoning laws protecting single family houses, to put an end to 95% of our city's population being priced out -- permanently banished  -- from ever being able to own property across 4/5ths of the land in this city.  

The practical effect of this promise will be to see, without getting into the dirty details, an *upzoning of all single family home areas* in Vancouver to support medium density or higher.

All at once.  No exceptions.  No NIMBY special interest carve outs.   

Equal sacrifice for everyone.  So that no NIMBY can argue they are being unfairly targeted.  

And if you don't like duplexes and other forms of gentle density increases cramping your single family house style inside a major city, then too bad:  Move.


**Conclusion**

The YIMBY manifesto is a call to end zoning SFH-privilege.  It recognizes that in the affordable housing debate the most serious changes needed to help struggling renters and potential buyers are changes often directly opposed by those who are interested in preserving home equity.

This tension is one reason for the inability of municipal parties to take strong effective action to cool down Vancouver's housing prices.  Without it, most political will to increase housing supply and availability will be tied to ""safe"" approaches that only tinker around the edges.

The silent majority of Vancouver has had enough.  The YIMBY manifesto realizes that those lacking in SFH-privilege will never receive the adequate political voice that they need until they directly organize together to advance their interests as a group.  This manifesto is also a way for younger generations who have been *betrayed* by progressive members of older generations to fight back.  To gain a voice that represents *their struggles for financial security*, not baby boomer home owners.

It's time for younger generations and other non-property owning people across all generations to organize in ways where they can finally take decisive action to put an end to [single family home zoning insanity](https://twitter.com/ahvancouver/status/800458823081132033) -- our first step towards Making Vancouver Liveable Again by allowing the proliferation of a more diverse housing stock within 80% of our city's land mass.

Does anyone have experience submitting a review for this? I was wondering about what factors they considered in reducing the length of the prohibition and whether they would apply to my case. 

I am a class 7 and have 4 points, which led to the 1 month prohibition. 2pts for not turning right in a right turn lane and 2 pts for turning right at an intersection outside of allowed hours (5 months apart)

All i could find online is : An Adjudicator may consider the **driving record and history, personal or financial hardship, family responsibilities, employment and other relevant information**.

What might apply to me:

- I volunteer weekly at a place and would have to walk there for 30+mins at 4am if I can't drive (no transit at that time). This is in the middle of surrey, so i am *very scared* for my safety

- Relatively minor offences (though I did pay the fines, so i am considered guilty)
- Could bs something about family responsibilities idk


Basically, I am hoping to hear from anyone who successfully reduced the prohibition time so that I have a better idea before I go to a firm. I know it's only one month, so the chances are probably low, but here's to hoping:)

Hi, I will be flying out of Vancouver on an international flight through Air Canada. I am from the United States and have never been on a airplane before. I have read through various sites that talk about about what you are allowed to bring and not bring on flights and checked (not the carry-on) baggage.

I would really like it though if anyone can double check what I am bringing since it is very confusing for me. I would like to not make any mistakes. I think things are ok, but I have read so many sites that my head has become a little confused. Especially since I was accidentally reading US websites at first. So for if I made an error, would it be possible to double check?

For my carry on I will be bringing

- 1 backpack with a soccer string bag that is folded up (nothing inside it). 
- an ipad &amp;amp; charger cable (I know the U.S. has banned laptops and tablets on flights, but I haven't found anything that says this is true for Canada as well? Is this ok)
- several mechanical pens and pencils
- 2 epi-pens for food allergies
- a 15600mAh ankar battery for recharge (since I intend to watch video on my ipad for the duration of the flight, and it is very long) https://www.anker.com/products/A1252011
- several usb cables for charging
- an empty waterbottle that I will fill up after going through security
- a blue tooth headset and my phone https://www.xmpow.com/headphones-speakers/mpowr-thor-over-ear-foldable-bluetooth-wireless-stereo-headphone.html
- a binder with my passport and travel information printouts, and a small amount of local currency.

For my checked luggage

- a bottle of over-the-counter advil 
- a stapler
- books
- cloths
- deodorant and toothpaste + brush
- my bag
- two bottles of sun screen
- two pairs of shoes &amp;amp; one pair of soccer cleats
- some hair ties
- a can opener
- a power strip
- an inflated soccer ball &amp;amp; pump
- two glasses (drinking, not eye)

One thing I am very uncertain about is the ankar battery. This air canada site

https://www.aircanada.com/content/aircanada/us/en/aco/home/plan/baggage/restricted-and-prohibited-items.html

says ""Spare lithium ion cells or batteries with a rating of not more than 100 Wh each"" are ok. However my battery says 15600mAh so I do not know how to convert between these two units? It is not very big though?

Question:  **Should Vancouverites who care about housing affordability issues create their own political party to contest the Vancouver City municipal election?**

-----------------------------

Half-joking, half-serious.  In response to this idea... I've hastily written a manifesto/rant as a template for organizing a political movement like this.  It seeks to inspire others in Vancouver.  To generate discussion and to get people thinking.  It echoes off the anger of movements like #DontHave1Million and #HALTYVR, making a strong case for how to prevent zoning laws from strangling the creation of more flexible diverse housing around SFH areas.

**Introduction to the YIMBY manifesto**

The term YIMBY stands for Yes In My BackYard, a response to anti-development people nicknamed NIMBY's.  The ""YIMBY movement"" is neither a left nor right movement.  Its inspiration here for this manifesto is heavily borrowed from SF's [BARF -- the Bay Area Renters Federation.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html?_r=0)  The NY Times summed up their thinking as:

>[BARF] Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.

>[BARF] supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. “You have to support building, even when it’s a type of building you hate,” she said. “Is it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.”

YIMBY shares the spirit of BARF, but with a Vancouver flavour.  We are in a crisis and we will not get out of it by limiting the expansion of development.  Nor will we get out of it by just caving into developer demands, without actually freeing up more broadly all zoning laws that are limiting the construction of flexible housing units like duplexes, etc.

In Vancouver, our primary rally cry is the concern that 95 per cent of Canadian families can not afford to buy a single family home (SFH) in Vancouver, while single family home zoned areas in Vancouver make up 80% of its land area.  Put another way, the top 5% of families are now on an alignment to ""own"" (eventually) 80% of Vancouver's land.  YIMBY believes this core injustice perpetuated by zoning laws working against the interests of the broader public needs to end.  

NPA / Vision / Green can never take the actions that are needed to help younger generations on this issue, due to the intractable conflicts of interests they have with SFH-owning members of society.  Their politics will always invoke an attempt to find balance in ways that privilege home equity values.  If newer generations want to find effective advocates for their interests on this issue, they need to make it clear they are willing to break with older progressive allies to align together a new coalition that's focused primary *on their econonic interests, not those of SFH home owners.*

Because NIMBY (Not In My BackYard) forces among SFH neighbourhoods hold very strong political sway over individual rezoning decisions, including even among traditionally ""progressive"" parties like Vision or Green.  The YIMBY manifesto proposes fighting their strong influence by targeting the system from a higher level by advocating for a bold, proverbial *ripping of the band aid* reform of all zoning laws that limit single family houses from higher density all in one go, where ever possible.  This approach would move the City of Vancouver away from the current wishy-washy incrementalism that has paralyzed effective action on housing affordability.

In most zoning battles, home owners can effectively win as ""NIMBY's"" within zoning battles because renters don't show up to fight these battles.  We believe a city election could be different.  If a battle over zoning philosophy is fought during a city election as the party's primary issue, we create a way for the large vocal interests of non-SFH owning and renting people to gain back their voice.  Home owners who fight against electing YIMBY's with fierce intensity may be shocked to learn just how much built up anger and resentment exists out among those who have had enough with *SFH-privilege.*  These *non-SFH owning* voters are the silent majority, the silent guardians of housing affordability who can make the YIMBY party possible.

**The YIMBY Identity**

A YIMBY political party if created in Vancouver will not function as a regular political party, but more as an organized movement.  Neither left, nor right -- it is for the renters, the dispossessed, the homeless, those who missed out on the single family home lottery, and those who just want a reason to tell the existing order *to go fuck themselves.*

In some ways... it's a Trumpian effort -- minus the bigotry, ignorance and racism -- to #DrainTheSwamp of all of our pathetically ineffective politicians who have gleefully stood by as our city has hollowed itself out.

In other ways, it's a way for new generations to express their anger in highly tangible and effective way: a way for Gen Y and Gen X'ers to truly assert their grievances as many did with Bernie Sanders campaign during the Democratic Primary.

This movement is *screaming protest* against the status quo insanity those with property have subjected on us in Vancouver.  We watch as Gregor feigns sadness about the plight of renters, while gleefully profiting off his own home equity rising.  YIMBY seeks to redefine political norms in ways that shock those among Vancouver's political class.

**Vision, NPA and Green fuck over younger generations**

This manifesto argues a YIMBY-style party is necessary due to the inherent electoral dynamics of how city councils respond to issues of zoning.

The YIMBY is the only party that can fight consistently for the interests of renters.  Unlike NPA / Vision / Green, a YIMBY party is under no pressure to submit to the complaints of SFH owners.  Unlike these parties, YIMBY *will take a side* on these issues in a way that other parties won't.  YIMBY *will not* fiddle *while Vancouver burns* because we know what we want and we will do what it takes to get it.  

**Vancouver issues viewed by a YIMBY**

- YIMBY-ers *will not* mortgage the wellbeing of future generations to protect the paper millionaire profits of those who made wealth through no particular skill or agency of their own.

- YIMBY-ers will reject as a false equivalence anyone who tries to argue that the wellbeing of Kitsilano residents losing a downtown view corridor could ever take precedence over the problem of renters not being able to find a shoebox to rent from downtown in buildings that have had their heights capped. 

- YIMBY-ers know that the choices forced upon them between single family homes and condo shoeboxes are *false dichotomies* created by our leaders craven political inability to allow any [middle housing options](http://imgur.com/R5fhwsM) within SFH suburbs.

- YIMBY'ers know it is *not normal* [for 95 per cent of Canadian families to be priced out of being able to buy a single family home in Vancouver](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/11/21/vancouver-should-prohibit-single-family-home-construction.html), while those land masses within Vancouver occupy 4/5ths of the city's land space. 


**Our Campaign Platform: 1 Promise**

The YIMBY campaign platform centers around one concrete platform promise:

>To abolish any and all zoning laws protecting single family houses, to put an end to 95% of our city's population being priced out -- permanently banished  -- from ever being able to own property across 4/5ths of the land in this city.  

The practical effect of this promise will be to see, without getting into the dirty details, an *upzoning of all single family home areas* in Vancouver to support medium density or higher.

All at once.  No exceptions.  No NIMBY special interest carve outs.   

Equal sacrifice for everyone.  So that no NIMBY person can argue they are being unfairly targeted.  

And if you don't like duplexes and other forms of gentle density increases cramping your single family house style inside a major city, then too bad:  Move.


**Conclusion**

The YIMBY manifesto is a call to end zoning SFH-privilege.  It recognizes that in the affordable housing debate the most serious changes needed to help struggling renters and potential buyers are changes often directly opposed by those who are interested in preserving home equity.

This tension is one reason for the inability of municipal parties to take strong effective action to cool down Vancouver's housing prices.  Without it, most political will to increase housing supply and availability will be tied to ""safe"" approaches that only tinker around the edges.

The silent majority of Vancouver has had enough.  The YIMBY manifesto realizes that those lacking in SFH-privilege will never receive the adequate political voice that they need until they directly organize together to advance their interests as a group.  This manifesto is also a way for younger generations who have been *betrayed* by progressive members of older generations to fight back.  To gain a voice that represents *their struggles for financial security*, not baby boomer home owners.

It's time for younger generations and other non-property owning people across all generations to organize in ways where they can finally take decisive action to put an end to single family housing [zoning insanity](https://twitter.com/ahvancouver/status/800458823081132033) -- our first step towards Making Vancouver Liveable Again by allowing the proliferation of a more diverse housing stock within 80% of our city's land mass.

[Here](https://www.facebook.com/events/263085720747549/)  is the Facebook event. You will need to join the /r/Vancouver Facebook group before being allowed/invited to the event on Facebook. It's been posted on the main feed a bit, but if you see it there, click the ""events"" tab on the Facebook group and join it! Facebook no longer allows you to invite the full group, which is why if you are in the group, you may not have seen the event pop up/gotten an invite. 

**Here is the description that's on the Facebook event, for those of you who aren't Facebook users;;**

Global Reddit Meetup Day is the 25th of June, which is fast approaching. That is THIS Saturday

While we originally talked about doing a BBQ or pre-event, my work schedule has prohibited me from organizing it. If someone else wants to take that on, that'd be awesome. If not, I do apologize here to all the minors, I know that sucks. Also! A beach event wasn't planned because the forecast is shitty. 

THROWBACK [har har, to 2012], 
We're heading to Pub 340 on that night. It used to be a very popular hang for the end of the night for r/van meetups, and a lot of us met each other there for the first time. It should be neat to see some familiar faces in familiar places. 

The group in general is pretty nice, so don't feel worried about coming down. I've set the event to start at 8:30, meeting in Pub 340. Feel free to arrive around then, or after, and get yourself comfortable. There will likely be a signal of some kind, whether that be a little table sign or something, on the way in, to orient those who aren't familiar with r/van's faces. 
If you have questions, feel free to leave them below or toss me a private message! If you are a non-drinker, don't worry! No one is going to pressure you at all. If you are a drinker, don't worry! There will be lots of those too.

Hope to see everyone there!

**FAQ**

*What's the gender balance like?* 

It's almost pretty reasonable. Hell, even equal at many events. Just come and see.

*I don't drink, should I come still?* 

Yes! No one will pressure you, have a cola, have a blast. 

*I'm a minor, should I come still?*

Up to your discretion!  ^^sorry ^^the ^^weather ^^is ^^too ^^ugly ^^for ^^a ^^beach ^^event 

*Why no beach event? I only attend things in the wilderness.*

I've seen a lot of meetups planned and the ones that involve a lot of strangers and the possibility of changing locations, run a far higher risk of turning out poorly. It's hard to update everyone, it's hard to have people check their phones, the weather is iffy and unpredictable, someone has to bring a bbq, there are just a lot of complications. *But* the facebook group holds many beach events, so this will not be the only one. 

**If Pub 340 burns down between now and then, I'll update this post with the new location**.

**Warning of Scam Artist Operating Around SkyTrain Stations**

New Westminster - Transit Police is issuing a public warning of a scam artist who routinely targets those who appear to be foreign students around SkyTrain stations.

In the past several months we have seen an increased pattern of incidents around SkyTrain stations from downtown Vancouver to New Westminster, where a male approaches members of the public asking to borrow cash. He typically approaches people who appear to be foreign students, then attempts to befriend them by saying he is a student. He states he has been unlucky as of late and wishes to borrow money. The victims loan him the money only to find he is unreachable later on.

His approach normally includes the following details:

* He is an international student from the United States or the United Kingdom, and may use an accent
* He needs money to repair his vehicle or buy gas
* He shows his Facebook profile or provides his phone number to gain trust
* He will claim to go to the same school as the victim, even using real teacher & class names to sound genuine

The suspect is described as:

* 20 to 30 years old
* Caucasian, with a fair complexion
* Slim build
* 5 ft 10 in
* Clean-shaven, with cropped dark brown hair
* Gaunt, sunken facial features, and dark circles under his eyes

Members of the Transit Police have investigated each reported incident, but at this time no charges have been laid. We would like to remind everyone to be cautious of frauds like this one, and urge extra caution when making transactions privately and not through a registered organization or business.

Soliciting is prohibited on transit property and vehicles unless permitted by TransLink or for non-profit purposes. If you see someone soliciting, or you are approached by someone who fits the above description, please contact us at 604-515-8300 or by text at 87-77-77.

I am from Spain and i'm going to travel around Canada with a Working Holiday Visa establishing my headquarter in Vancouver.
To my knowledge mairhuana is legal in Vancouver, I have read that you can buy marihuana legally in dispensaries, I've also heard that it is needed a card to buy marihuana in these stores.

Am I, as a foreigner with a valid visa, allowed to get this card and buy marihuana with it?

Can someone explain how can I get this card? Is this card valid only Vancouver?

Also, I am concerned about do and dont's: It is prohibited the possession of marihuana? Can i walk around with marihuana in my pockets without having any misunderstanding with the police? Where can i smoke marihuana? There are bars where smoking marihuana is allowed? Any recomendations? It is allowed to smoke in parks?

I have to say that i don't want to smoke in Vancouver like i was in Amsterdam. I'm very discreet but i have to be careful because i don't want to have any problems with my visa.

Is it okay to play with water guns at beaches in Vancouver, precisely at Sunset Beach? 

I understand use of any inflatables such as tubes, beach ball, inflatable beach mattress are prohibited due to safety reason.

How about water guns? Is it okay to play with toys at a beach?

There's going to be a big water fight in Stanley Park early in August, but it doesn't feel right to throw water away for fun under the water restriction these days.. although I've been looking forward to the event so much.

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I am a new driver and still have so much to learn.  I'd appreciate it if you could help me with this.

I was in Vancouver recently and while there, I was ticketed and towed from the bus station at the Main Street Sky Train under By-Law 2849 Section 17.1 which states the following:

>17.1
An owner, registered owner, lessee or operator of a vehicle must not cause, allow or permit that vehicle to stop at any place where a traffic sign prohibits stopping.

For a little further clarification, if you face the bus station, I was parked alongside the concrete barrier that is in front of the fence that is just north of the Via Rail guard shack.  If I'm not mistaken, this would be the east side of Station Street.

And there are indeed several signs that prohibit stopping in that area on both sides of the street, but above every single one of those signs is a sign that permits parking for two hours between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm.

Maybe this is where my understanding is off, but I thought that meant you could park for any length of time outside of those hours.  I guess it could also mean those no stopping signs underneath take effect outside those hours, but given that there's cars parked in that area at all hours of the day, I assumed the former.

I parked in the same area for several days between the hours of 7 and 11 am (not for the same length of time each day) without issue.  The day I was towed, I parked there at 6 pm or just after, and I came back to find my car gone, with another car where I was parked, and another parked behind.

What am I missing?

Hi folks of r/vancouver. Typically, one would turn to Craigslist or Kijiji for this sort of thing but I know there is a much stronger sense of community here on reddit. I really wanted to give this a shot here first.

I am currently renting a house in Richmond with two friends but both will be moving out in approximately two months and I am losing my job at the end of February. As things are very uncertain at the moment we are looking to sell some used items as a means of getting by. We also need to find homes for some of our pets as one of my roommates is moving cross-country.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


We have one XBox 360 to offer, unsure of the gigs/generation but I will update as soon as I find out and any accessories it may come with. Very good condition, runs smoothly. We are hoping to get $150.


An assortment of rare Magic: the Gathering cards. Uncommons/commons available to rifle through as well. Most are from the Kamigawa block but I have several from Mirrodin, Timespiral, Ravnica, Lorwyn and Shadowmoor blocks. There's a card or two from Eighth, Onslaught and Urza blocks as well. 99% of the rare cards are mint or near-mint.

We have two beautiful female cats that unfortunately cannot come with either of us when we move. It breaks our hearts to let them go.

The first is our 4-year-old calico, **Moxxi**. She **will need** SPECIAL attention and a very understanding home. Moxxi carries herself like a queen (but is spayed) with the looks to fit but she has a very nasty habit that none of us have been able to condition out of her. She will NOT defecate in a litter box and she must never be left unsupervised in a bedroom or she will urinate on your bedding. We do not know why she does this, she is perfectly healthy and can only speculate that it is a psychological issue. Thankfully, she prefers to defecate on laminate/tile usually located in bathrooms so that has made for easier clean-up. She has been in our little family for 3 years so this has nothing to do with her issue, it's about letting potential homes know exactly what they are getting into. It would be heartbreaking and frustrating to learn that she ended up in a shelter or worse because of her flaw. She is an incredibly sweet, loving girl who needs to be allowed to move at her own pace.
http://imgur.com/ExKkqAH,e4IhaUj,iubJ4cY,JAetdKB

Our second sweetheart is **Azura**. She is a dilute tortoiseshell (mostly grey) and her age is unknown as she was taken in from the streets. My roommate had been feeding and watering her from the deck for several weeks when one day she came by with a note on the collar my roomie had given her: ""Hello, I have a person who feeds me sometimes but cannot afford to keep me. I have had several litters. Will you give me a loving home?"" It was a done deal. Although we are ashamed to say that she is still not spayed as my roommate is on a fixed income, she is an incredibly loving and intuitive ladycat. We are so grateful that Azura showed up unannounced into our lives, the least we can do is find great home for this older girl to live out the rest of her days, however long that may be. We can only speculate that she is between 6-9 years old.
http://imgur.com/w0hf2vv,Oyfd1KK,obG9pg5


Our last concern is how much we love our large mischief of rats, perhaps too much. We have older (9-12 months) females and males that will need new homes, plus some of our newest additions that are reaching 4 months old.


I apologize for such a long-winded post, I only hope this is met with kindness rather than negativity. We wish we had other options for our beloved animals but we simply don't.

Quebec has made winter tires mandatory. Manitoba offers a financing program through their public insurance agency for people to buy winter tires. In certain mountainous regions of BC winter tires used to be required, but the provincial government has relaxed that requirement as of this year.

What bothers me most about this is that there was a regional manager from Kal Tire on CKNW just a couple weeks ago telling people that winter tires aren't really necessary in Vancouver.

I'm sorry if this is a fairly obvious question, but I've never owned a car in Vancouver and I need some advice. This is going to be a bit long... sorry.

My boyfriend is planning on buying a second car, but there is nowhere for us to put a second vehicle in our buildings parking. Technically our spot can fit 2 vehicles, but as it's beside the wall if you fit 2 vehicles in (and both are very large, an SUV and a Mercedes E class), but because of the wall and the pillar, you need to park both cars very close to each other, which makes it impossible to get into the vehicle that's parked beside the wall. Renting another spot isn't an option, and neither is parking in the parking at the back of the building in the lane as the building's owner's office is there, and using the parking during there during the day is prohibited. That means I would need to wake up every day at 8:00 am to move the car, as I'm not working currently. There already isn't enough parking in our underground garage, as the building owner is allowing people to rent spaces for car storage, leaving those of us who actually use their vehicles in the lurch like this - there are already residents who are renting parking spaces from the building next door.

I live on Oak, and I cannot park my car in front of the building during the day because it is a no-stopping zone. I can't park in the lane behind my building because as I can't find a spot that won't have me violating the CoV lane parking bylaws . I could park on 70th ave, but I live close to the lights, and I am afraid my car will get hit or towed if I leave it there regularly.

We live in an area that doesn't require parking permits to park on the side streets, but reading the [parking by-laws page](http://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/unsigned-streets-and-lanes.aspx) wasn't very helpful. It says you can only park 3 hours on a side street unless you are a resident - **how do they define what a resident is**? The closest parking options for me are either across the street on 70th avenue (where my car could be hit), or 3 blocks up on 67th ave, or a street or two away from Oak. Can I get towed for parking there? Because I don't live on that street am I not a resident? 

My boyfriend and I have had numerous fights over this already, and I would love to find an answer to give me peace of mind, and for him to stop yelling at me for worrying about the car getting hit or towed. Thank you for your help!

**tl;dr: I can't park in my building's underground parking or parking lot. My only options are a busy street by a very busy intersection, or on a side street a few blocks away from my apt building. CoV says non-residents can only park for 3 hours... how do they define a resident?**

Hey guys!

Global Reddit Meetup Day is June 14th, 2014 this year. That is THIS Saturday! While we originally talked about doing a BBQ or pre-event, my work schedule has prohibited me from organizing it. If someone else wants to take that on, that'd be awesome. If not, I do apologize here to all the minors, I know that sucks. Also! A beach event wasn't planned because the forecast is shitty. 

HOWEVER, The fantastic folks [and redditors] over at the Tavern have agreed to host us all. We'll be able to drink in the basement and play skee-ball and pinball, or sit upstairs and eat. There's gonna be a beer/burger special that night, as well as 3$ beers, bourbons and Granville Island draft sleeves.

The group in general is pretty nice, so don't feel worried about coming down. I've set the event to start at 7, meeting in the basement [Tavern]. Feel free to arrive around then, or after, and get yourself comfortable.

If you have questions, feel free to leave them below or toss me a private message! If you are a non-drinker, don't worry! No one is going to pressure you at all. If you are a drinker, don't worry! There will be lots of those too.

Hope to see everyone there!

I was a class 7 (N) and i drove contrary to my restriction. I was driving under the influence (which i never do, was my first time) going home from a bar. I got stopped at a roadside and got a BAC of .042

I got a 12 hour suspension.

A few weeks later i took my class 5 driver's test and passed. 

I recieved my class 5 driver's license. Now i am wondering will i still lose my license for a year as all novice drivers do? this is my first offence but still under the legal limit of .050)  Or will it not matter because it was below .050?

I have 2 points from a stupid ticket, and 3 points from the suspension. From what i understand you have to have 8 points to be prohibited (when i have 5). 

Will i lose my class 5 and become a class 7 again?

Anybody who knows anything on what happens please let me know.

**Here's the moderation process I've been using:**

* A comment is reported
* If the comment is clearly not allowed per the moderation guidelines then remove the comment.
* If time/energy permits post a message stating the comment was removed per moderation guidelines.
* If the poster responds engage in conversation to determine if the poster feels the decision was fair, wants the moderation to be undone, or decides to change their comment.
* If a poster requests to undo the moderation and the comment is not an extreme violation of the moderation guidelines then reinstate the comment.

**Moderation Rules with wide support:**

* Hate speech is not allowed here, including (but not limited to) racist, sexist, aggressive, or overtly offensive comments. These comments, whether intended to be a joke or not, are prohibited.
* No personal attacks or name calling.
* Posting personal information of any kind is not allowed.

* Don't post: complaint/rant posts, editorialized titles/incendiary posts, any content not related to Vancouver.

It's been pointed out that some readers of /r/vancouver are very sensitive to censorship and unfair moderation therefore when unsure moderators should error on the side of leaving a comment in place.

We're still working on defining what exactly we mean by hate and what generalizations are ok and which are not.  This definition was recommended by majormoron

> Bad: Racial hate. Gender hate. Sexual orientation hate. eg. Hating someone for who or what they are.

> OK: Hate of anything that is within someone's control. eg. I hate Surrey. I hate Starbucks. I hate M&Ms. I hate Gregor Robertson. It should be ok to hate a city, product, idea, government official (maybe a grey area), weather, material, number, colour, etc...

**Feedback when comments are reported and/or removed.**

I ran a trial of letting people know when their comments were removed and why.  This resulted in either the comments being changed to better match the rules, being unchanged and later approved when requested, or just being deleted by the commenter.   In addition some great conversations were had that helped refine my understanding of what moderations are acceptable.  Unfortunately some people seemed to be really offended by the process.  I think letting users know when a comment is removed will help improve the overall tone of /r/vancouver/ however I really want more feedback on this idea.

When we remove a comment what else should we do:

* Reply to the comment stating why it was removed.
* Reply to the poster privately stating why the comment was removed.
* Silently delete the comment.

I'd really like your feedback on this!

Looking for a little legal advice or insight. 

Background.

I hit a road block friday night and blew a ""warn"". The officer proceeded to impound my car and hand me a ""Notice of Driving Prohibition"". Which is fine, I messed up and he said he wasn't going to dui me or anything like that so it'll be fine. 

The problem.

It seems the officer has written down the wrong driver's license number, wrong expiry yr, and also the wrong person at the bottom where it says ""I personally served _________ with a copy of the notice of driving prohibition."" 
The Driver license number apparently belongs to some random girl i've never met and the bottom part, he wrote my dads name instead of mine. 

My name (fake one being used for example) is John Michael Smith.
My dad's name is Michael Smith (yes my dad's first name is my middle name)
--and all the officer wrote was that he personally served Michael Smith with a copy of the notice of driving prohibition. Which is my dad, and not me.

The thing is though, at the top of it, he has my correct full name, as well as my birthday and full address. 

As you can see there are plenty of errors on this ticket, but overall he has me pegged down by name and address. So my question is, is there enough mess ups for me to possibly void this ticket? Or is this considered non fatal errors that can be changed in a court of law? If anyone has any insight to this, that would be awesome. Thanks guys!

I put this in here because I know these laws differ from province to province, so I was hoping for someone familiar with BC Law and or ICBC to see this and give me advice.

spacepilotblastoff,,1374607513,,False,1iwjvk,False,True,t3_1iwjvk,54,False,/r/vancouver/comments/1iwjvk/some_thoughts_on_the_bad_mdma_here_and_prohibition/,31,"To start this off, it's very important that everyone is aware that [the U.S. government poisoned its own citizens](http://chemistry.about.com/b/2010/03/01/government-poisoned-alcohol-during-prohibition.htm) to scare people away from drinking during prohibition times. The idea was that a few high-profile deaths in the media would be enough to demonize liquor completely in the eyes of the public.

What's been happening in BC lately seems to resemble this situation. There's been a large MDMA-taking culture here for years, and good, clean drugs used to be in abundance. However, our new chemical licensing laws have made it increasingly difficult to procure large amounts of Saffrol, a key ingredient in organic MDMA synthesis. Because the drug trade is so gang controlled, it's not necessarily a good life decision to come up short on your quota if you work in a lab, so suppliers are forced too make up the difference in product with other drugs which may or may not include methamphetamine or research chemicals.

Now, no drug dealer wants to sell dangerous drugs. It's not in anyone's best interest to kill a customer. Not only are you losing individual sales, but any media exposure or word-of-mouth will cut into profits as well. So why then are we seeing so many potentially lethal research chemicals on the street? Particularly this recent mix of MDMA and PMMA. PMMA is dangerous on its own, but when paired with MDMA the danger skyrockets because your ability to maintain body temperature is severely compromised. On top of this, PMMA does not react to the Marquis reagent, the most common consumer drug testing agent, whereas MDMA reacts strongly. Therefore, the PMMA is very difficult to detect, and even smart dug users who test their chemicals may not recognize it.

As I stated before, no drug dealer intends to kill their customer, and PMMA is a well-known killer. Why would *any* dealer knowingly buy and mix that stuff with rare, pure MDMA?

It is also interesting to me that when there is a death covered in the media, there is never any information on identifying substances that are killing people or how to recognize symptoms of an overdose.

I would much rather see a harm reduction style approach to drug use as opposed to full prohibition and non-disclosure of information.
What it comes down to is that a few dead teenagers on the news is much more effective for demonizing drugs from a social standpoint than police presence will ever be, and it's sad that BC would rather let our kids die instead of educating our youth on safe use.

I've been here a while, but I thought I'd create an alt just for this.

So I think I'm not alone in noticing the recent increase in medical cannabis dispensaries all over Vancouver metro.

This is an article I'm writing. It's for a blog, but I'd really like to send it to the Province or the Sun or something. I know they'd probably eat it up. Possibly for the wrong reasons, but meh.


I'm unashamedly pro-dispensary, pro-legalization but I've tried to be realistic about it. If bias is clear, please do tell me.

If you disagree, please tell me.

If you see a weak or manipulated point I've made...well you get it.


The article isn't finished, yet. I still would like to talk for a paragraph or two about the actual structural difficulties faced by dispensaries just outside of Vancouver, especially in regards to communities, mayors and city councils.

But, so far, I'd love to hear what anyone might have to think. I'm surprised I haven't read a similar article, yet.

***ARTICLE*** 

The British Columbia Compassion Club Society. Imedikate. Westcoast Medicann. Urban Earth Med. Yaletown Medical Dispensary. Vancouver Pain Mangement Society. The Medical Cannabis Dispensary.




Some of the names listed above may be familiar to Vancouver residents, while others may not be. In the last decade citizens have witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of medical cannabis dispensaries that operate within the city limits of Vancouver. However, the neighbouring municipalities of Coquitlam,  New Westminster, North Vancouver and Surrey have seen no such increase in their jurisdictions. When it seems as if a new cannabis dispensary establishes itself in Vancouver almost every other month, it must be asked why dispensaries outside of metro Vancouver, such as the Natural Path Society of Coquitlam, N.I.C.E. of New Westminster and the [DEEP COVE ONE] seem unanimously doomed to failure.




The British Columbia Compassion Club Society (BCCCS)  was the first medical cannabis dispensary to open in Vancouver and began operating in 1997. Established as a non-profit society, the BCCCS has grown into the largest dispensary in Canada over the last 15 years and serves over 5,000 members. It’s services are not limited to the provision of medical marijuana (to those possessing a certified medical Doctor’s recommendation), however. The BCCCS provides: acupuncture, counselling, nutrition, herbal medicine, reiki, craniosacral and massage therapy, and yoga to the community, using the revenue from cannabis sales to subsidize these treatments, which can otherwise be prohibitively expensive for users. In 2010, nearly 4,000 members used these services with 88% of the total cost subsidized. In addition, the BCCCS developed a voluntary, but comprehensive “Guidelines for the Community-Based Distribution of Medical Cannabis”.



The dispensary model put forward by the BCCCS has since been widely acclaimed as the “poster child” of responsible, community-focused medical cannabis provision. [source] Almost all dispensaries operating within Vancouver offer alternative health services or a fast track to them, as well as a sliding scale of payment for those low-income residents in need of treatment. The success of the BCCCS model of community-based, health-conscious and low-income considerate medical cannabis access has influenced the [dozens] of dispensaries to follow and helped counter the perception of dispensaries as commercial “pot shops” and “legalized drug dealers” concerned solely with profits.



In fact, many fears associated with dispensaries have been disproven over time. Far from being a source of problems for communities, the actions of the BCCCS and others have established a very positive presence in and valuable service to the community. In addition, as dispensaries provide a safe, judgement-free and health-positive environment in which members can administer cannabis treatment, away from the eyes of the community and children. Dispensaries do not cause an influx of crime into a community. Far to the contrary, a medical dispensary is a “street dealer’s” worst nightmare. Dispensaries decrease the need for medical users of cannabis to buy from illegal street vendors and the positive relationship that many dispensaries have with local law enforcement make the area an unprofitable and potentially dangerous place to operate; if one is a criminal.

The story has some even worse parts than I thought.    The father was banned from the school grounds for yelling at some girls who bullied his daughter.

They filed an appeal with the school board and all the parties agreed that he would be allowed on school grounds for sports day and the girl's grade 7 graduation.   

After all was said and done, the superintendent came by his house two days before his daughter's grade 7 graduation and presented him with a letter prohibiting him from going on school grounds.

At the grade 7 graduation they had a cop there ready to arrest him.

Bullying is a problem in our schools, especially when the school principal is bullying parents like this.   No one has yet been disciplined in this case.

Edit 2(wanted more explanation) At a time when Vancouver has a big need for rental venues (schools and community centres are pretty much booked as much as they can and are expensive) AND Scouts Canada on the whole is growing now, it makes no sense to get rid of real estate in one of the worlds hottest real estate markets. Scouts Canada has exactly two properties in Vancouver, one at 664 West Broadway and this is the other. It just makes no sense to sell a property that could easily be revenue neutral for scouting use, rather then scouts fundraising to keep it around. Especially when Scouting could never purchase property again, simply due to the prohibitive cost of land.
