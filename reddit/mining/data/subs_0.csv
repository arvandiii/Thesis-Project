DevelopmentDenver,t5_2fr2dk,"**denver's booming backstory** in 1858 a group of gold prospectors from kansas decided that it was time to go out west for the pikes peak gold rush. this first settlement, known as montana city, was in the western kansas territory. even though montana city was later to be the site of denver, settlers preferred the town of auraria and left montana city behind. general william larimer placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the south platte and cherry creek river. thus, denver city was born. from a starting population of 4,749 in 1860, denver proper has grown over 14,372% with the metro area over 59,261%. that's a lot of growth in just 157 short years! from a mining town to the city it is today, denver has faced many challenges but has greatly succeeded, becoming a better city each day. let's explore some great moments in denver's growth. **great denver development links:** /u/mhc1858 and /u/d-rav co-manage **[denverinfill]( /u/mhc1858 founded denverinfill and has been running it for over 15 years with /u/d-rav onboard for 11. they are a free, non-sponsored resource that follows all development / construction related topics around central denver (downtown, surrounding districts, neighborhoods). /u/mhc1858 and /u/d-rav also manage the instagram account, ** ( and are pretty good at keeping it up to date. if you want to dive in to development, a lot of major architect firms will also post projects on their websites. some major names are: davis partnership, shears adkins rockmore, kephart, studio pba, stantec, ktgy, jns, humphries poli, oz, 4240, tryba, craine... **curious what is going through design review?** [denver cpd]( has all the answers for you. cherry creek, arapahoe square, lower downtown, river mile, and golden triangle have design review overlays. on cpd's website, you can check out future meetings and what projects will be reviewed. the big daddy of all public records that is the best resource out there: [denver e-permits]( this has quite a learning curve and i could write a huge tutorial that would put everyone to sleep, so i'll give you a basic rundown. a project needs to go through multiple processes with the city to get to construction. once you have located your project, make sure you look at the 'related records'. development typically follows this order: * concept plan - first documents filed with the city showing basic design. * formal site development plan - more detailed documents in addition to the concept plan. * water, sanitary, transportation, row, fire - even more detailed plans relating to the project. * building log - initial permit group for construction. * commercial construction permit - the project is ready to get built. this is always an exciting one. there are so many resources out there and i could probably keep going all day. if you have any questions drop **/u/d-rav** or **/u/mhc1858** a line and they'd be more than happy to help you out. have a great day!","a discussion thread relating to development projects in and around denver, colorado.",1467
