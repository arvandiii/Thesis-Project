How bad is it? Are wildfires active nearby the town to point of evacuation? Is it weeks and weeks of smoke?

If it was so bad, surely the town would not be so popular?

Some perspective on this would be great. Thanks.",nelsonbc,Whatâ€™s the wildfire situation in summer?,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/nelsonbc/comments/yy831t/whats_the_wildfire_situation_in_summer/
