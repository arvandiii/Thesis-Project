Looking to get other peoples thoughts, suggestions, and resources on the question!  This is flaired ""discussion"" for a reason!

I believe we are headed for some very rough years ahead - for discussions sake lets say up to the next 50 years (as I'm currently in my 30s).  I have a background in geography, the public sector and asset management which has had me thinking about this question more and more lately.  I would be interested to hear thoughts in 2 general categories - purely most resilient (ie. the title of this post); but also what is the most climate resilient place in BC that ALSO balances against quality of life, access to amenities, cost of living, jobs, etc. etc.

Some of the risks I'm thinking about are things such as flooding, fires, heat waves, water shortages, coastal storms.  I've been browsing [https://climatereadybc.gov.bc.ca/](https://climatereadybc.gov.bc.ca/) and [https://www.pacificclimate.org/analysis-tools/plan2adapt](https://www.pacificclimate.org/analysis-tools/plan2adapt) as a starting point and I'm sure there are ministries and other professionals with the government or private sector looking at the problem considering all aspects (am I sure? I sure hope they are looking at all this...)  I guess my question stems a bit from a doubt whether the government is doing enough, quickly enough.

However, as someone deeply involved in safety on the job, it's disheartening to witness the ongoing compromises. Safety often takes a back seat, and it's only when an unfortunate incident occurs that people start paying attention. This negligence is driven by concerns about expenses, inconvenience, annoyance, and time constraints.

Even organizations like WorkSafe sometimes seem focused on saving money or time, leading to ambiguous laws. Our occupational health and safety standards in British Columbia are notably higher than those in other provinces, yet there's a push to lower them to a ""universal"" standard across the country for the sake of time and cost savings. The title ""Construction Safety Officer"" is primarily associated with Vancouver building codes, but what most of us do is act as ""Qualified Coordinators."" It's crucial for all of us to have at least a minimum OFA 2 certification to cover these sites. Sometimes, the responsibilities can be overwhelming for a single CSO due to the vagueness and subjectivity of the regulations.

It's frustrating that every site I oversee seems to have its peculiar issues. Phrases like ""look the other way,"" ""scrub the records,"" and ""WorkSafe hasn't visited this site in over 2 years; let's keep it that way"" are all too common. But when a colleague decides to adhere strictly to the rules, WorkSafe suddenly decides to inspect all those sites within the company. They might find a couple of machines out of compliance, label it a day for inspections, throw that colleague under the bus, fire them, and bring in someone like me who won't report the company.

Just the other day, a Mexican worker suffered a severe injury—a snapped-back hammer to the face—resulting in a RTC scenario. Shockingly, there was another worker injured at the same time, but it was treated as a Triage Scenario- had to let that one go and deal with the mexican- who turned out to be an undocumented worker- had to fly back to Mexico that night for facial surgery. Scrub the records of him even existing on the site. In such situations, you learn that sometimes safety takes a back seat and many laws are being broken every day.

And when it comes to industrial jobs, it's sometimes a joke. Working in confined spaces without proper safety measures can make you feel like your life is at the mercy of the task at hand. For instance, consider the risks involved in projects like the Broadway subway construction. In case of an earthquake, it's a precarious situation.

Entering the trades is a commendable choice, but it's essential to be aware of the risks you're assuming on every site, every day. If you're indispensable to the project, safety violations may go unnoticed because the site super needs you to keep the operation running smoothly. We, safety professionals, are essentially insurance policies hired to minimize risks, but  oftentimes safety takes a backseat.

If nobody else seems to care, it's essential to remember that you bear the responsibility when you work these jobs. Also, it's worth noting that in some situations, it may be cheaper for everyone to deal with your ""loss of life on the job"" over a carrier ending injury.

Consider this a warning: Our country is facing similar issues to America in terms of workplace safety. We used to set the bar high with the best safety gear and the highest standards, but that seems to be a thing of the past.

Lastly, a word of caution: Avoid riding the Broadway subway once it's operational. You've been warned.",britishcolumbia,Growing Disillusioned with my job- oh yeah hey I'm a CSO BTW.,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/169eai1/growing_disillusioned_with_my_job_oh_yeah_hey_im/

Ontarian here whose experience with natural disasters is entirely tornadoes: For a handful of evenings every summer, we have to mosey down to the basement while the wind dances and possibly throws a barn for fun. Flooding too - Southern ON is too wet to burn, but everyone has a sump pump to work the water back out of their basement when the rains come. All that to say, I've never had to deal with a natural emergency that could last for several days and required me to pack an emergency bag and have the pets ready to go at the drop of a hat. You can also recover a lot more stuff from a house that is flattened by wind than from one that is burned to cinders.

So watching BC's and NWT's wildfires scare the shit out of me: Those are big cities getting chewed through by fires labelled as ""out of control"".

All that said, BC is beautiful and my spouse is keen to move (back) to the province after a long foray in the east. I want to try and at least seriously consider the possibility of moving to BC and understand our options. I know there's no guarantee of avoiding a fire 100%, but it seems like some regions (hello everywhere along that highway to Alaska) are put on alert more frequently than others.

What are my options if we move to BC and want to have the lowest possible wildfire risk in the future - Van Island? - and are there other extreme weather considerations I need to have in mind when looking at those areas? Links to any recent regional averages for fires are also super appreciated.

The fire chief meticulously took each ones names and numbers and relevant skills. They were told the best place to go to put out spot fires. They brought food and supplies to the firehall and were in turn fed and watered. They were an integral part of saving the town. I watched this unfold with my own eyes. 

So many people acting courageously when the time came. Hundreds of people willing to risk their lives to protect their town, yet the volunteer fire departments total manpower is less than 20. It makes my blood absolutely boil. If even half of those 100 people had stepped up and received training they could have been infinitely more useful in slowing the fires. The #1 problem they had was manpower. They had hundreds of people available willing to fight but all that manpower is useless without the communication and organization that is needed to actually properly fight the fires.
 
I have the utmost respect for each one of those citizens and I beg beg beg ANYONE who feels that they have the strength and courage to defy an evacuation order to protect their town to join the fucking agencies that are dedicated to do that exact thing. If they had 100 volunteer firefighters with 100 radios they could justify the expense of 100 sets of gear, more trucks, more equipment. Instead we had locals fighting fires in the middle of the bush when houses were burning. We had air assets available to deploy but they COULDNT because locals were in the middle of the forest fighting fires. 

I'm not even going into the thefts because desperate people saving their homes do desperate things. Its despicable, but I can at least emphasize with  it. What absolutely enraged me was finding a group of locals 10km from town fighting a fire using obviously stolen equipment in an area where no structures were at risk.  They were there because if they were closer to town they would have been caught with stolen gear. They got to play fireman deep in the Bush believing they were helping the community all the while preventing air assets from being used, using equipment that could have been used to protect structures.

THIS is the truth that needs to be shared. The RCMP overstepped their grounds but they did so because the theft is so rampant. Thieves stole the fucking  pumps from the scotch creek bridge for gods sakes.

I implore ANYONE who has the courage to defy an evacuation order, JOIN YOUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. They will give you training! Provide you with the organization to effectively deploy large amounts of manpower. You will get to stay and protect your community through evacuation orders. You will be allowed to move freely through town. ITS SO EASY. Its SO much easier than the alternative...hiding and skirting law enforcement without coordination and communication. 

Fuck

So much devastation, so much loss. So much manpower waisted I just cant take it. 5 days of 18 hour days working with people who lost their homes yet they still show up every day and will continue despite their fellow community members efforts to undermine their work.

Hopefully you all are as fine as possible.

We are a couple from Austria which travels to Canada next week. Our first idea was to stay at my gf brother's place in Calgary and visit Banff,  jasper and drumheller. Usually we do like hiking, nature, food and wine on our vacation.

Afterwards our plan was to drive from Calgary to Vancouver (31.8. to 7.9) stay in Vancouver for two days and then head home to Austria on 9.9. Stops were few areas in the Kootenay region and Okanagan valley.  We already have a car rental booked.

However, since the recent wildfires in Kelowna we do not want to stay there anymore due to not block any homes for people who need to be evacuated. Not sure if it even would be possible for us to stay there on 4th of September die to the travel ban for tourists in that area.

Therefore we think about to rearrange our whole trip between Calgary and Vancouver. We have some options but do not know if they make any sense.

Option 1: Still visit Kootenays and maybe Watertown lakes National Park and then head to Vancouver. Some risks would include: road blocks due to fires, and smoke in the Kootenays since there also are wildfires. Does anyone know how the situation is there? We'd like to visit Cranbrook, nelson, Ainsworth Kasko and nakusp.

Option 2: cancel the car rental and fly to Vancouver directly. Than book a car rental in Vancouver and visit Vancouver island instead for the remaining time. However, Vancouver Island seems much more expensive than Kootenays.

Option 3: not sure exactly. Maybe drive via hwy1 and stop somewhere in between. Like golden revelstoke and do the sea to sky highway. 

Since this all is quite spontaneous we are a bit overwhelmed with the options and would like to rebook everything by tomorrow if possible. Hopefully some of you has some insights and tips for us.

Thank you in advance and stay strong!

Edit: first of all we are overwhelmed by the number of replies. Unfortunately I am not able to answer all of you, but I wanted to say, that we are going by option B. It is more expensive, but it is the safer bet.

Consider building a Corsi-Rosenthal box with a $50 box fan and one or more MERV13 (3M Filtrete 1900) furnace filters. Richard Corsi is the Dean of Engineering of UC Davis, and Jim Rosenthal is a Texan engineer who runs a furnace filter company. I have built many as part of teams that assembled them for schools for COVID. They are ideal for forest fire smoke. The numbers check out in terms of extreme simplicity of build, CADR (volumes of air purified per unit time), and particulate counts. These things pound through the air, and if you have a particle counter (PM2.5, PM10), you will see the numbers drop fast in real time. What a relief.

You need: One standard box fan, 1-5 MERV13 filters (20"" x 20""), duct tape. 

For a one-filter unit (called the ""Elfstrom variation), follow these detailed instructions on Twitter from the HVAC/P.Eng., David Elfrom, in Ontario. 246 cfm, Energy star rating, costs $55:

* Effective 1 PM today, the province has issued an order that restricts travel to temporary accommodation in or at wildfire-affected communities in the southern interior of the province.
* The order is designed to discourage and stop recreational and leisure travel for tourist accommodation. The order does not restrict essential travel through or to these communities – including for work, for school and to help care for a sick loved one.
* There will be no random stops or street checks enforcing this order. We’re not interested in disrupting commuters and people going about their lives. What we want to do is ensure those needing accommodation in wildfire-affected areas have access to it.
* We continue to strongly urge people to avoid travel within these regions as well. If you live in Victoria or the Lower Mainland, do not vacation in the Southern Interior right now. If you live in Chilliwack, do not spend a weekend in Osoyoos.
* This order affects a small portion of the province. There are many places to vacation in B.C.
* For more information visit [EmergencyInfoBC](http://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/)

Hi everyone.

With the different and recent Wildfires that have sprouted up in the past few days, there have been an understandable amount of pictures that have been posted to show the absolute scale and destruction that they have brought to our respective communities. On behalf of the [r/britishcolumbia](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia) mod team, we'd like to express our thoughts and well wishes to those most affected, and especially want everyone to get themselves to safety.

As these fires have grown fast and rapidly, we also understand that there are folks who haven't been able to post their photos right away. For example, there are reports that people have had to sleep in their cars overnight, on their way top safety. We'd like to help ensure that people aren't seeing new posts and thinking there's a new fire to worry about.

&#x200B;

**Moving forward, please ensure that your posts START** **with**

\[*Specific* Location - Date/Time\]

e.g.

\[Hwy 1 north of Boston Bar - Aug 18/2:30PM\]

\[Gyro Beach Park West Kelowna - Aug 17/9:30AM\]

&#x200B;

Being as specific as possible will help all of us better understand the rapidly evolving situations.

This post will be updated as necessary.

West Kelowna one is looking pretty aggressive they just expanded the evacuation order. We’re packing a to go bag just in case! For those of you who haven’t been here for BC fire season or are unaware about emergency preparedness PLEASE HAVE A GO BAG READY🚨 Fires move very quickly and the wind here currently is ideal for the fire to jump. Overnight we will need to keep alert! It can happen very quickly so be prepared. 🚨

What I pack in mine is any paperwork, contracts, things that I cannot replace like that or documents. ID (passports, birth certificates etc). Medications & note the prescriptions 💊Contacts, glasses 👓 Laptops, any tech you may have that you wouldn’t want to lose! Toothbrush toothpaste 🪥 Extra chargers, portable chargers if you have them. Also make sure your pets are indoors and you have their vet information etc just in case! 

In addition to that I recommend keeping notes in a cloud/online based notepad like Evernote etc with prescriptions, important info, and TAKE PHOTOS OF ANYTHING YOU DONT BRING or videos of your house belongings for insurance purposes. Make sure this stuff is accessible and ready to go quickly in case you do not have time to search. Any sentimental things you can’t lose as well. 

With the fires in the Northwest Territories etc burning in remote areas I think it’s also important to note that you should get to know those in your neighbourhoods and communities. The government is not helping us! They will not be the ones at the ready in your time of need if it comes and now more than ever we need to focus on community! Some people do not drive, some are disabled, some elderly and we all need to look out for one another 💗

It used to be weekly now it’s near daily. There is a grate with what appears to be a ventilation fan that is on only sometimes, but the landlord/building owner keeps it off. I think he started to turn it on now when he comes to the building because we sent a complaint. When it’s on, the hallway doesn’t smell so bad. When it’s off, the second hand smoke is overwhelming not just when you’re in the hallway (to the point that when I’ve leaving I’m holding my breath or I’ll gag/cough) but it completely floods our entire unit. We have to open the sliding door to air out the place which means we can’t use our new a/c, kinda defeating the purpose of getting it… 

I wrote another request today asking him to keep the ventilation on continuously as it’s negatively impacting our air quality in our unit due to second hand smoke but just had the realization that it might be against code/a safety issue to not have hallway ventilation going continuously. I realized what if there was a fire or a gas leak in another unit (we have gas fireplaces) or some other kind of noxious chemical in the air and the hallway had no ventilation as we tried to evacuate? Is this a safety issue? If it’s not kept on continuously can I express a safety concern?

At the time, type 1 fires were permitted in this area, and there were no specific signs banning campers from having campfires in this specific campsite. I had a chat with the group, asking if this was the best idea; there was not a proper fire ring, the local fire risk was “high” and that alpine wood typically takes a long time to grow and it is not the most sustainable choice, plus if the fire did get out of hand, give the remoteness it would be hard to put the fire out. Their defence was that they looked at the fire regulation and this type of fire was permitted, according to this logic they were correct (they were very nice about it).

My question is, are there any specific rules that prevent people from having campfires in the alpine? If there isn't, should there be? It’s such a fragile ecosystem and it leads to campers tearing up the little alpine trees and shrubs for fire wood.

Since last weekend, I note that a ban on campfires is due to be enacted, but for the future it would be good to know this.

How did the Cariboo Gold Rush change the History of Canada? Why should Barkerville be your next travel destination?*

1. First of all, [**Barkerville**](https://terraencounters.wordpress.com/2023/06/13/barkerville-bc-the-town-that-changed-the-history-of-canada/) is not a ghost town — it was still in use until 1958. Filled with original wood buildings, it lets you travel back in time to the 19th century when there were only dirt roads and raised wood boardwalks.
2. Second, the town was built almost overnight twice — The first time at the beginning of the Cariboo Gold Rush. The second time it was rebuilt in six weeks after a devastating fire in 1868.
3. Third, it is the largest preserved historic site in Western North America.
4. Fourth, Barkerville was the first Chinese community in Canada and half of the residents were Chinese!

Today, [**Barkerville**](http://barkerville/) is populated with costumed interpreters and shopkeepers who have assumed the identities of past colourful characters. The skits are entertaining and sometimes very funny.

5. Finally, it played a significant role in Canadian history that affected all of North America.

I am dismayed by how many people - including Ministry of Labour employees - don't know some of this basic information. For example, the ""Labour"" Board is for the ""Labour"" industry... that is... unions.

**For issues with the Employee / Employer Relationship:**

* **Union workers:** **contact your union for all issues.** If you have a problem with the union itself or if you are trying to START a union, contact the Labour Board. Remember... Labour Board = Union.
* **If you are a worker that is not covered under a collective agreement (union), not in a federally-regulated industry, and not in an excluded profession or occupation:** if you have an issue with your employer, contact the **Employment Standards Branch** unless it is related to an occupational health and safety issue.
* **Workers in** [**Federally Regulated Industries**](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/workplace/federally-regulated-industries.html): you may not fall under the jurisdiction of the Employment Standards Act OR all provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, so start with your union, if you have one. I would love someone to fill in my information gap on how to help workers that belong to federally regulated industries.
* **Workers in excluded** [**Professions & Occupations**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/forms-resources/igm/esr-part-7-section-31) are covered by a variety of other legislation. The Employment Standards Act doesn't apply to workers in these categories, so don't call the Employment Standards Branch for help. You probably need to contact your professional body.
* **Gig workers:** try the Employment Standards Branch, but you may be SOL. This is apparently on the Ministry of Labour's ""to do"" list. Most gig workers are considered Independent Contractors, so they are not protected by any labour-related legislation. If this is important to you, contact your MLA or Minister Harry Bains' office to let them know how you feel.

**For Occupational Health and Safety Issues**, including bullying & harassment or Prohibited Actions (when your union or employer punishes you for raising an health & safety issue):

* **Union workers: contact your union.**
* **Most workers in BC, including federally-regulated industry workers and union workers: Contact WorkSafeBC.** You should always go through internal channels first, though.
* The OHS provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act **do not apply to mines governed under the Mines Act**, so if you work in this environment, WorkSafeBC may not be the right people to go to, so if you don't have a union, you should contact... ???

**For help dealing with WorkSafeBC:**

* If you have a complaint about the **service quality or communication problems at WorkSafeBC: contact the** [Fair Practices Office](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/contact-us/departments-and-services/fair-practices-office) **of WorkSafeBC OR the** [Provincial Ombudsperson](https://bcombudsperson.ca/)**.**
* **If you have a problem with what is and isn't covered by the Workers' Compensation Act:** **contact your MLA or Minister Harry Bains**. Examples: disability benefits end at retirement (this was introduced by the previous BC Liberal government), how much is paid to workers (90% of net with a cap for high income earners), lack of compensation for ""pain and suffering"" or ""quality of life"". These are all legislative, and there's nothing anyone can do about it unless legislation or policy is changed.
* **Union workers: contact your union**. Many unions have a compensation appeals department that can help you, and they will have integrated knowledge of any disability benefits you have access to. They may also be doing special work on a certain type of injury or have specialty knowledge on how to help workers in your industry get their claim accepted. For example, one union is including a Charter challenge to all claim appeals that fall in a certain category. The PFFA has worked with WSBC on the overall problem of hearing claims for Fire Chiefs always being denied.
* **Get help from friends and family.** You can authorize someone else to have claim access and do the talking with WorkSafeBC.
* **Follow your claim online or request claim disclosure.** You have a right to request and access almost all the information WorkSafeBC has about you. Staying up to date on everything can help.
* **Most workers in BC:** you can contact the [Workers' Advisers Office](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/personal-injury-and-workplace-safety) **for help dealing with WorkSafeBC**. Their scope is strictly limited to the Workers' Compensation Act, so don't contact them with non-WorkSafeBC-related issues.

I'm calling the RTB tomorrow, however I'd like to know whether anyone else has dealt with a similar problem.

I've signed a 1 year lease for an apartment in May 2022. I'm moving out due to constant fire alarms and many other problems in the building that the building manager is not doing shit to address. 

I've given my notice on December 30th to vacate the unit on January 31st. I've even found a very decent person interested in taking over my current lease and offered this option to my landlord (and to vet them as well). They were able to move in on January 10th. 

Landlord refused and told me they're not interested in whoever I found to replace me. Fair. I was ready to pay for full month of January while they can show the unit to potential tenants as I'm pretty much moved out at this point, just need to sell off some furniture.

Their response was that they want me to pay rent for one full month of February as well due to this clause in the lease I signed: 

'If the tenant unilaterally ends the fixed term tenancy before the end of the fixed term, the Landlord may, at the Landlord's option treat this Agreement as being at an end. In such event, rent must be paid for the full month of notice given, plus the additional sum of another full month's rent on top, will be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord as Lease Break Liquidated Damages and not as a penalty to cover the administrative costs or re-renting of the rental unit.' 

I don't believe this is enforceable because of this policy guideline at [https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/residential-tenancies/policy-guidelines/gl04.pdf](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/residential-tenancies/policy-guidelines/gl04.pdf) : 

'A liquidated damages clause is a clause in a tenancy agreement where the parties agree in advance the damages payable in the event of a breach of the tenancy agreement. The amount agreed to must be a genuine pre-estimate of the loss at the time the contract is entered into, otherwise the clause may be held to constitute a penalty and as a result will be unenforceable.' 

I also found this at [https://tenants.bc.ca/your-tenancy/breaking-a-lease/](https://tenants.bc.ca/your-tenancy/breaking-a-lease/):   
'If your landlord is forced to re-rent your unit at a $25 discount to secure a replacement tenant, they could be entitled to $25 per month over the remaining term of your agreement. However, if your landlord can re-rent your unit for more than what you were paying, that additional money they will earn over the remaining months of your agreement can be or applied to, or “set off” against, any other money you owe your landlord for unpaid rent or damages. '

There's no way they can't find a new tenant by February 1st, as I live in Metro Vancouver and there's a high demand for apartments. Plus the rents went up - they will be able to re-rent the unit by at least $200-300 extra each month.

I dont know if this kind of post is allowed here. If not, please let me know. Im wondering if anyone with a camera would help me out with something?

My wife and I were engaged in 2015 at Seton Lake near Lillooet. We havent had a chance to come back since (we are from Scotland).

We had limited time with an RV so we only spent a short time there. I wish we had spent a whole day, but alas, we were on our way the morning after we got engaged.

Nowadays we make it a habit to eat dinner with the tv playing something ambient. Think a forest, or a fire, waves crashing etc.

For our christmas dinner I had a thought that maybe I could find Seton Lake but no luck. 

So with that in mind, I am wondering if anyone would be willing to go to Seton Lake, set up a camera at the picnic tables there, looking out towards the water, and film a couple minutes of footage? 

I am a video editor so I can happily turn it into an hour long ambient thing, akin to what we usually have on.

Thanks for your time. :)

Edit: the response to this post has been incredible and I cannot thank the BC community enough for your help. In particular, four of you, who have sent existing footage or offered to go to Seton Lake to film some, and one person who ventured out to nearby Anderson Lake to get some footage for me. Thank you a million times! Christmas dinner is gonna be amazing this year and one day we'll be back with the family when we will stay a bit longer.

Edit 2: thank you to this wonderful commmunity for your help. In particular to u/drista and u/zuqwaylh who were able to provide the pieces needed.

Me and my partner fly out from Toronto tomorrow to Abbotsford. We have visited many times, her father lives in the Province, and we will be staying in Chilliwack. 


Now on previous visits we have done a ton of hiking, however a bucket list item for me has always been to summit a mountain with a large amount of relief, to get that iconic view from the top. We have done long and difficult hikes before, and I've done my research for what to expect, so I'm not worried about the technical or physical demands of attempting it. However, since I am the more physically fit of the two of us, I wanted something that was both impressive but also not overly dangerous or difficult, and so decided we should climb Cheam Peak. I've also shown her the route, assured her it's not too arduous, it's relatively popular, not overly difficult, and is close to Chilliwack so won't require a massive treck to get to.


My main concern now is with the fire in Hope. I have no experience with wildfires in Ontario, and don't know the danger of hiking anywhere near them. My assumption is that since Cheam is 20+ Km from the fire, this would still be safe, but I am just guessing. Additionally I don't really know how smoky it will be. I would assume most.of the smoke will drift east with the prevailing winds, but that is just a guess.

Ive always dreamt of road tripping through Canada and my partner is obsessed with Crater Lake, Oregon, USA.  

We decided to get married this year and are going to elope at Crater Lake! The plan was to drive straight down from Vancouver to Oregon, get married, then honeymoon in Canada, doing a Vancouver > Calgary road trip through the Rockies.

We have flights already booked. Landing in Vancouver, departing in Calgary. Hire car is also booked for pickup and dropoff in those locations. Marriage licence and permit is sorted as are a photographer and officiant for the ceremony.

No accommodation is booked, as we were going to figure that out on the way.

Im absolutely in pieces at the minute, the stress of everything is really getting to me. There is zero news in UK about the wildfire situation but I am aware of it.

Im worried we wont be able to find anywhere to stay, we wont be able to travel within Canada. We also need to travel from Vancouver through Washington to Oregon. Is that even possible right now??? 

Im also super aware that I dont want to be a tourist taking up any resources needed by locals.

Im this far away from pulling the plug on everything.

It was purchased through Delta and uses Delta as the first flight within the US, with West Jet operating the final two.

I was going to visit my girlfriend in Kelowna this week, but she evacuated and went to Calgary with family instead. I had a simple request for Delta: Let me keep my current times/flights but simply stop at Calgary and return from there rather than continue on the last flight to Kelowna. Their response? Trying to charge me anywhere from $800-2,100 USD to drop one flight-- more than the entirety of the original itinerary.

I explained to them that it is illegal for me to enter Kelowna. They said there is nothing they can do unless Delta posts a travel advisory/waiver for Kelowna, which is unlikely when they don't actually operate there. Unfortunately, they are refusing to acknowledge the BC travel advisory and will not work with tourists scheduled to fly there. It does not matter what the Canadian government says.

West Jet said there's nothing they can do yet because it's a Delta ticket. However, they have offered me some assistance, but only once travel is imminent (24 hours prior to my flight). So luckily I have options, but that unfortunately involves me tying up time and resources with a company that is actually trying to help others affected by this natural disaster with an emergency flexible cancel/change policy.

I thought it was important to draw attention to companies doing crappy things. Bottom line: Delta is using this disaster to make a quick buck, and it's disgusting.

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice. While I don't personally need it at this point (West Jet is cooperating, and I have travel insurance), hopefully it's useful for others. Just calling out a company for being awful. A broken system like this just makes an already difficult situation harder.

EDIT 2: My travel insurance covers getting me to my final destination, which I cannot get to. So it will cover getting my money back and getting me home, but it won't help with re-routing me to a different final destination. I'm at the mercy of Delta and West Jet, and West Jet has been a lot more cooperative.",britishcolumbia,Delta Airlines is refusing to acknowledge the wildfire travel restrictions,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/15w03dy/delta_airlines_is_refusing_to_acknowledge_the/

I'm quite introverted and like the idea of living somewhere quiet with my dog.. I'd like to be near or within driving distance to a larger lake for fishing and have access to good hunting grounds.  It would also be nice to be close enough to a town that has anemities.. I also enjoy mountain biking,ski/snowboard.. 

I have not explored bc much and really know very little about any of the small towns or bigger towns like Prince george.   

Mostly , Im wondering what the differences between regions such as cariboo, okanagon, etc. What are the different regions known for? How are the winters in the different regions and other considerations like wildfire risk?

I am also looking to purchase a property. I have about 550000 to spend.. Ideally a small house with an acreage/shop

I'm originally from Québec and am looking for a new place to settle in Canada. The west, for obvious reasons, has so much appeal, especially as someone who loves being outdoors and hiking. I would like to live in more rural areas. Unfortunately, there's a huge drawback that I just can't shake: wildfires. I would love to hear locals' experiences on what it's like to live in a place with an increasing number of wildfires due to climate change.

Here are my concerns:

How much do wildfires affect you? Either directly through evacuations or indirectly through air quality. 

How often is there poor air quality in your area? I have had a hard time finding resources online indicating yearly recorded number of days of poor air quality in the province. I plan to be outside working in the garden a lot and being active. As someone with asthma, I believe that many days with poor air quality would seriously affect my health.

I currently live in Eastern Canada working full time doing environmental/ecological restoration, though I’m in love with the west, I want to live there and work there but the options and what I like to do for work are pretty slim , 

I’d like to stay with restoration or get into fish hatchery work of some sort , or guiding hikes / nature or environmental outreach, parks work, or even wildfire work but I’m afraid of seasonal work (comfortable in my year round work) 

What do you do in the winter ? How secure is it to come back to your summer and winter positions each year? 

I know a lot of people will ski patrol or tour but I don’t snowboard or ski and I think I’m a bit old (25m) to get into it enough to pursue. I also have 0 avalanche risk experience for navigating winter alpine regions 

I have experience with machinery use and wouldn’t mind snow removal but I’m not certified in anything, just have used tractors and skidsteers and ATV’s. 

I also wouldn’t mind trades work like carpentry ETC. but I’m also not certified in anything along those lines, just have work experience.

I’m open to a lot, just trying to understand what all you experienced seasonal workers do and hoping for some ideas! 

Is this change worth it? I’m nervous for leaving my current job but I think I’m just more comfortable than anything, I know there’s better restoration work available and I can’t stand living where I’m currently living, it’s been my dream to live out west ( BC/AB ) and I want to pursue that before I’m too old to enjoy the outdoors experience and regret my waiting around.

We really value supporting local businesses -- especially given the impacts of the last year on that region. So if there are recommendations of places to stop along the way that we could support, we'll definitely hit them up.

I quickly came to appreciate the wonderful scenery, mild weather, and overall urban experience. I've also travelled around the province throughout that time. I briefly lived on the Island, and also in the Boundary region. I've travelled through the Okanagan many times on my way to the Interior. It seems that everywhere I go, I find a new appreciation for my place in the mosaic of beauty that is this province. 

Though lately, I am finding it difficult to love my home. For all of the value it has added to my life, I am growing dissatisfied with life here. For all the richness to be gained from travelling in this magnificent province, I seem to come away more jaded as of late. In the Lower Mainland I struggle to find local streets and stores which are not crowded at all hours of the day. I find the long stretches of windy, rainy, cold days to be increasingly offensive. It seems that no matter where I go, I am justified in my deep dread of the stench of impending wildfire smoke every summer, along with the sore throat and painful itch it brings to my skin. We have always found it difficult to access proper healthcare here. The cost of living is now alarming. My parents cannot afford their own home anymore. I do not remember any of these challenges so vividly in my past. 

Coming from Manitoba, we dealt with extreme weather, mosquitoes, and poor urban infrastructure. Though sunny days were plentiful and parks were well kept.  

In short, there is always something to complain about and there is always something to be grateful for. My apologies, I am not writing for this purpose. 

I understand that no matter where I go, there will always be threats and there will always be benefits. I understand that I will continue to see things differently as I move through different stages of my life. What I seek to understand, is whether I am alone in experiencing this particular dissatisfaction over recent years. Is it really just me? I am willing to accept that the grass will always be greener on the other side.

This topic has been top of mind for me as my wife and I are looking to settle down somewhere, and we just aren't sure if we love it here anymore. We aren't sure if these complaints have become ""deal breakers"" for us. This is obviously a matter of conjecture, and it is obvious that the responsibility of making this determination is between my wife and I. 

In summary, my ask for responses is as follows:  
1) Is anyone else feeling dissatisfied with the experience of living in BC lately?   
2) Whether you do or you do not, please share the thoughts and stories that come to mind. I am genuinely interested.

My partner and I are both working for the federal gov in Ottawa. We've known for awhile now that the national capital region is just not well suited for the degree to which we want to pursue our personal interests (hiking, backpack camping, mountain biking, skiing and backcountry skiing eventually). We spent 2 weeks hiking the rockies last summer and we absolutely adored it especially because we could push ourselves way more than over here.

Over the past year we've both worked hard to successfully secure permanent WFH agreements and now that we have them, we want to get things rolling to hopefully move to BC by October 1st. Nice thing about this is that we can pretty much choose to live anywhere we want granted that we can afford it.

So now, i'm coming to you folks for recommendations on where we should look. Couple things to know:
1. Location is key - we are weekend warriors so we need to have lots of difficult hiking and backpacking places within 2-3 hours driving. It would be nice to have stuff closer, including mtb trails.
2. We need a 3bd appartment and would like our monthly rent to not exceed 1800 (it doesn't have to be new obvs, we can work with anything). 
3. Vancouver is out of the question - too expensive
4. Ideally i don't want to have to worry about wildfires 24/7
5. Whatever the city, we don't care about location (suburds, etc), because we basically just want a homebase to come back for work after weekend activties. 

Based on the above, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also looking forward to hearing any thoughts about things we should know about living in BC. If you know of rentals that would fit our needs, please send them my way as well!

I've searched the App Store (iOS) for an official BC emergency alert app but couldn't find one. Either it doesn't exist, or it didn't show up in the results. I then ended up stumbling across the [Alert Ready](https://www.alertready.ca/index.html) site. According to their site:

*""Alert Ready is Canada’s emergency alerting system. Alert Ready delivers* ***critical and potentially life-saving alerts*** *to Canadians through television, radio and LTE-connected and compatible wireless devices. The Alert Ready system was developed with many partners, including federal,* ***provincial*** *and territorial emergency management officials,* ***Environment and Climate Change Canada,*** *Pelmorex, the broadcasting industry and wireless service providers.""*

As of October 27 there were no alerts issued by the system for British Columbia in 2021. None (see image). 

The Alert Ready system is supposed to issue alerts for wildfires, forest fires, air quality, landslides, storm surges, and many other emergencies. (See second image). Ironically, an Alert Ready test supposedly went out yesterday (11.17). I never received it (my phone was on Do Not Disturb and the system doesn't bypass that).

I'm listening to a replay of the press conference with Premier Horgan and BC Public Safety Minister Farnworth; questions were asked about why the Alert Ready system wasn't utilized. (Sidenote: It certainly looked like Farnworth got testy when pressed about the alert system, didn't it?)

So, my question is... what gives? Is this system useless? What apps / systems should we be using instead as an alert system? Farnworth justified the lack of alerts by saying that Alert Ready is triggered only when individual regions / municipalities ask for it.

 But ZERO alerts for 2021? C'mon...

TL;DR: Alert Ready system is supposed to alert people about emergencies such as natural disasters, no alerts were issued for BC in 2021 as of October 27. Is it useless?

I have the semi unique position to have worked at least a week in nearly every bc town over the last 10 years and have always made it my mission to understand what a place has to offer when im working there. so do to that its my duty to offer a detailed response to that list.

I will break down each community by four criteria. 

1) apparent crime and or social issues 

2) work opportunity

3) outdoors

4) shopping/ restaurants/amenities

5) housing opportunity 

6) general vibe.

1- prince rupert. 

1) rupert went through a long time of economic downturn. due to that stagnation the town visually suffers from sagging down town stuck in time. crime isnt extremely apparent but you get the feeling low grade organized crime has involvement in some port activities.

2) due to the deep water port employment is on a huge uptick and many high paying low qualification jobs come from ridley island and that is only expanding

3) the ocean! if you like boats, hot springs, beachcombing fishing etc this is the place for you. two major issues are there is no public access to the ocean from town and that sucks, also it is so goddamn wet you may have to grow gills.

4) mediocre shopping, fantastic restaurants. cow bay is a highlight. the airport is so wierd. you have to take a ferry there. but ferry service is great

5) its extremely hard to build on rock and space is limited so get ready to pay a lot of money for a old house slouching towards the sea.

6) I hate working in rupert due to the wetness but im not sure there is anywhere id like to be more than out on the water on a sunny day,

2- fort st john/dawson creek

1- this one wont be super favorable. alot of recreational hard drugs pass through the camps and hotels of the town. you can see if everywhere. has to be the highest pawn shop to population ratio. 

2) its major redeeming factor? lots of work to be had but less than a decade ago, low skill work is such a double edged sword. when the work dries up all you have is your health and a unrealistic lifestyle.

3) man you better like mud because as soon as you leave town its your top concern. hunting is big in the area but man i dont like it at all.

4) they have a movie theater and a ton of chain restaurants. fort has a fantastic sports complex.

5) way bloated housing prices are just waiting to pop.

6) depressing and gloomy. flat and full of people that dont want to be there. 

3- prince george (my town)

1) since the wildfires homelessness has been a huge issue with no real resolution. mainly relegated to the downtown core it still is a startling site a few years later. the gang issues that plagued prince decades past are mostly gone and generally it feels far safer.

2) prince george has been transitioning away from lumber into the government sector and it has attracted a lot of new people to the town. prince services most of the north in one way or another and has a lot of blue collar and low grade white collar opportunity.

3) hidden gem in my opinion. great mountain biking, cross country skiing, hiking, hunting, fishing. skiing withing an hour and the woods are withing 10 mins in any direction,

4) most everything you would find in any major city. my bias is showing but i think prince george has the best great restaurant per capita ratio you can find.

5) starting to get to typical bc un affordable levels but still obtainable and houses are constantly being built, 

6) i feel like pg is in a good place for the most part. lots of young professionals coming to the city to build a life. great outdoor waiting to be experienced and a busy downtown offset a real problem of homelessness. 

well thats all for now. i have to get to work. if anyone likes this i could do many more towns or offer advise to anyone who may be moving or traveling. i  hate all the mean spirited comments about the north. a lot of people judge a book for its cover. i spent a lot of time recently in southern utah and northern arizona and all over nevada and i can say without a doubt that northern bc destroys nearly every community down there in every way.

btw my favorite town in northern bc is smithers followed closely by terrace. happy  early remembrance day!",britishcolumbia,"In response to ""worst cities in British Columbia""",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qqxd4g/in_response_to_worst_cities_in_british_columbia/

A huge thank you to everyone who responded to my original post about our trip to the area in June - This community is great. We have made some changes to our travel route and wanted to share. We have had the flights and accommodations booked for some time but were able to make a few adjustments to the accommodations without an increase in cost. We also made sure that all ferry reservations were booked for the morning routes just in case there were issues and a later one was needed.

We have not made any specific bookings for activities yet. Instead we have made a list of possibilities for each day or area and, other than a few that will require booked appointments, are leaving it up to whatever we are up for on that particular day. We have no problem adding or dropping any ideas and honestly just doing this route and finding stuff on the way would be just as well. That being said, I would very much appreciate your help with additional suggestions of possible things to do or your thoughts/reviews on anything already listed that you think just aren't worth it.

I have started making a list of already suggested food spots but would love to hear more of your favorite places as well (especially your go to Asian food places and must have items). I know we are trying to get a lot in and could easily spend 1-2 weeks in many of these individual areas but are trying to make the most of our 2 weeks. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and provide your thoughts - you all have been awesome!!!

*A little background on my family: I am originally from Calgary and spent many years in Southern Alberta but have never been to Vancouver or the surrounding area and we have been wanting to go for many years. I currently work and live down in the States in Colorado. My family very much enjoys hiking and outdoor activities but we do not take many vacations. We all love museums, aquariums and anything to do with native culture as well as just enjoying and experiencing this beautiful world we live in. I have taken my girls back to Southern Alberta several times (I have to keep stocking up on my Canadian goods) and then they have been to California a few times. We are finally in a position to take a trip and this is what we chose to experience together.*

I was unfortunate enough to catch it early in April 2020 pre-vaccine, and had chest pain and fatigue for months after (what we now understand to be long-covid symptoms).

This year, I caught it again from a family member, and had relatively mild symptoms - several weeks later, I ended up in the ICU with a massive saddle/bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). If I had waited even slightly longer to call 911, I wouldn't have made it. Most people who get PEs are usually 60+ - I don't drink, smoke, or have other major risk factors. The doctors in the hospital said they are seeing many more PEs, strokes, and severe clotting in much younger people as a result of COVID, and we aren't counted in the hospitalizations because the hospitalization is not happening during an active COVID infection, but usually weeks or months later.

It would be very dangerous for me to catch Covid again with my PE and clotting risks now, as well as long covid symptoms.

Got a 60 day landlord use eviction months ago and made a agreement that I'd leave as soon as I could find a place because the rental situation here is a nightmare. It took me 4 months for find a place and I paid rent the entire time. I am a model tenant.

On the 23rd of this April I found a place. I had a week to try and find a truck and get help and pack. I had already paid for April rent so if I move out today May 1st the landlord would owe me one month rent plus damage deposit.

I get a text yesterday saying that my current landlord doesn't want to pay me my last months rent and she is not giving me my damage deposit back, citing that she will have to repaint and change the carpets (My place is spotless, no pets, no smoking). She is full of shit.

She if offering to let me stay in June ""for free"" instead of paying me but I have to move into my new place today, May 1st.

I was supposed to get 1800 dollars today from my old landlord as I need 2100 to move out and move into into my new place today. I will lose my new place today if I dont come up with $2100. I'm not getting cent today and my landlord told me to take her to court.

I am documenting everything.

I need advice.

I'll also point out that I never signed a eviction notice and the only reason that I was evicted was because I complained about noise at 5am. The house I was living in sold, new owners moved in Nov 1st. I signed new rental agreement Nov 1st. I politely complained about loud noises at 5am in the 3rd week of December (they wake up at 5am and wear shoes in the house and play ""ball"" with their dog on the floor at 5am andI live in basement with no soundproofing) and I was evicted for ""landlord use"" 3 days later.

Like usual when big wildfires flare up, a bunch of people have lost their homes and/or died. Lytton set a temperature record, then became a cinder. Condolences to all those who have suffered misfortune from all this.   
  
Things are probably going to get worse later on, but there are some things to keep in mind to make you feel somewhat better.   
  
1. The more forest that burns off, the less plant material is loaded on the land, so the less there is to burn off later. Assuming that the burn rate exceeds the overall growth rate, the amount of burnable forest should gradually reduce. Hopefully it regrows, but in the meantime, those burnt areas have less plant mass. So, that means that overall in the province, there would be less left to burn, which *might* lead to less smoke or burnt area in a similar time frame and area between fire seasons. Or, there might be a higher overall burned area in the newest fire seasons going forwards. Who knows.   
  
2. Statistically, a lot of the area would supposed to be second-growth, which isn't quite as much of a loss as old-growth. Though the ocean of forest catching fire in places is *not* a good thing when it comes to crown fires.  
  
3. To some degree this is the culmination of the last century or so's fire policy, which suppressed clearing fires and allowed excessive growth of brush and undergrowth, which endangers large trees like Douglas Firs, Sitka Spruce and Western Red Cedar, which can resist fires normally if large enough. The extra brush provides a ladder for fires to reach higher, and thus we get crown fires, where the whole tree dries out and goes up like a rag soaked in gas. Multiply this by tens of millions and ta-da, modern fire season. If the new forested areas grow back without the junk trees and scrub, and without fires being suppressed, then the crown fires won't happen so habitually.   
    
4. We have a long rainy season, which gives us two things: a) a lot of water, and b) time to prepare. We should be taking advantage of both. Do whatever you can to try to improve your personal situation with regards to the heat. I just live in a little apartment, so I stick a big Honeywell fan on my windowsill and generally run it near 24/7 until the thing dies. It helps make up for the mediocre a/c in this building.  
   
If you own a house, maybe plant some trees or shrubs for shade, or install better a/c. Do what you can to prepare for the summer heat. Because, as we've seen, high 20's or low 30's is something to expect now.",britishcolumbia,A grim silver lining to ongoing wildfires,0.65,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/oom4xd/a_grim_silver_lining_to_ongoing_wildfires/

I was just given a 1-month eviction notice (although they're giving me 6 weeks, until the end of July). The reason given was for smoking weed in the suite, after signing a lease stating I wouldn't.

Here's the thing: *I don't smoke*. At all. Not weed, not cigarettes, not vaping, not on this property or off it. But the landlords (who live upstairs) have said that they've smelled pot in the backyard, strongest near my suite, and have made up their minds about it.

I have spoken to the RTB and am planning on filing a dispute. Although neither of us has that 100% proof (short of me letting in a sniffer dog or doing a drug test), I do have evidence of many good-faith attempts on my part to communicate with them regarding this issue, which they have refused. Our history of written communication also demonstrates that I have been a friendly and obliging tenant, and that she has been a controlling and passive-aggressive landlord. (Most communication is with one of them, though her partner is fully in the loop and complicit.) 

She also has used her key to illegally enter my suite, and then got angry at me when she discovered I was home. As I was in the middle of a video call appointment at the time, I have a witness to that. Meanwhile, they have what amounts to a hunch.

I do think I have a good chance with the dispute, as they have zero evidence. However, disputes apparently take 6-15 weeks, and if I was successful the ""prize"" would be that I could keep living here. 

But she has made this such an uncomfortable and hostile living environment. My mental and physical health has suffered during my time here. I do not feel comfortable making even reasonable levels of noise, because I don't want to deal with aggressive emails or her yelling at me. Meanwhile, despite her emphasis on the need for me to be quiet, there has been near-constant construction/home renos going on, often right outside my office window (I work from home, which they know). 

Since this is such a horrible living environment, and my argument is much stronger than theirs, I'm considering offering them the chance to withdraw the eviction notice, and for us to come to an arrangement. I feel like compensation in exchange for me leaving at the eviction date would be fair, but I don't actually know if that's legal, or something I should suggest.

So my questions are:

\> Is offering an alternate solution a good idea, and are there any issues I should look out for/avoid?

\> If they refuse and we do go through with the dispute process, does anyone have advice concerning this? 

I honestly wonder if this is her trying to bully me out, rather than her actually believing it's me. On the night that she smelled pot, there was a yard party in a neighboring yard, but they refuse to believe it's anyone but me, and also refuse to have a conversation with me about it (I have written evidence of this). There are many more smaller cases/written evidence of controlling behaviour and hostility from her, but this post is already long!

**TLDR;** mom owns rented property, left the country temporarily, tenant hasn’t paid shit for 4 months and now squirming their way out of Sept 1 rent

My mother, who did not do any research in the BC tenancy laws, has no business mentality (extremely charitable), bought a property, fixed it up and decided to rent it out. Mind you, I was never consulted on the buying of this property, but was roped into helping with managing a property because she doesn’t know English (that’s a whole other rant). So we did end up finding tenants and they were great for about a year, then started falling off the wagon on late payments and then non-payment.

We’ve been way too lenient, and that was our mistake. By the end of last year we already sent a 10 day eviction notice, but they pleaded to set up a payment plan (which they were STILL late for). In the end, their relatives stepped in to pay their rent for a few months so they didn’t have to pay anything up until COVID happened. As soon as April 1st rolls around, they’ve both lost their jobs and can’t pay a cent. Meaning they had zero savings from the last few months of not even needing to pay rent. Seeing as they are already not on good terms with us, I’m taking that to assume they are absolutely taking advantage of the global pandemic.

I constantly have to contact them and remind them to apply for government assistance, they told me they were fighting with the government because things got deposited in the wrong account (???). They obviously did not apply (or qualify) for rent assistance because that required a portion to be filled out by the landlord. They’ve never reached out personally to try and work things out and every time I do ask, they just get annoyed saying they can’t control their circumstances. Maybe I am being delusional during a pandemic, but are there really people who have zero amount to pay? Could they not have paid in smaller increments? Half rent? Anything? Obviously social media isn’t going to hold in court, but all I see from them are posts about how much weed they smoke and what camping trips they’ve been on. 

I really would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but at this point I really can’t say they deserve it. I know people are really struggling through the pandemic, it just looks like they aren’t even trying. Really need to convince my mother to cut her losses and sell this place already, or find a property manager she can actually communicate with!

My current options are:

1. Ignore this until she gets back

2. Proceed with evicting (if it’s even possible without power of attorney)

3. Stop stressing because I can’t do anything and ultimately it’s not my problem

4. Just keep prodding them for rent..",britishcolumbia,Rant - Problem tenants taking advantage of COVID and having 4 months back-rent,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/ikbsjy/rant_problem_tenants_taking_advantage_of_covid/

And usually if he makes a mistake his way of saying “sorry” is giving me weed (I do smoke it but outside and away from people”. He finally complained to me that all he can smell is cat pee upstairs and it smells like they pee near the vents which again they don’t.

That is more than anywhere else in BC I've lived (Trail/Castlegar, Kelowna, Surrey/Langley, but Victoria will soon pass PG.

I went through a period of time (2011-2013) when I was in PG that I despised living there. The politics were abhorrent to me, the winter was too cold and inconvenient (given that I grew up in Surrey/Langley), to many big loud trucks, poor city planning/layout, and the only reason I was there was to get my degree at UNBC with an amazing pair of supervisors. What changed the way I felt was I tripped on 5 grams of magic mushrooms (kidding, that didn't happen), it was I started to be there long enough that I got to learn why everything was the way it was and what was good about PG. A massive reserve of lumber built PG ([and the original Mr PG](https://www.princegeorgematters.com/local-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mr-pg-1026044)). It is an industry town with BIG industry almost smack dab in the centre of our province ([The centre goes to Vanderhoof however](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g1590608-d12881785-Reviews-Geographical_Centre_of_British_Columbia-Vanderhoof_British_Columbia.html)). Unfortunate placement of the pulp mill made downtown smelly almost all the time and drove housing and business outward and away. That doesn't help build a cohesive city. Recent years the pulp mill smell has been greatly reduced, and downtown is starting to have some higher density housing built there! PG needs thousands of people to live right downtown, and right now, it has a few hundred to max 1000/75,000 population (depending on the boarder you set).For a number of years there PG's mayor and council were highly skewed, not just IMO, and made very poor choices dividing the city, but that has changed and a better balance of mayor and council has been elected. I still feel PG has had some very poor planning and development for sustainability and cost reductions (read too many roads and not effectively used and crumbling infrastructure), but people want clean air and I can completely understand that, and thus understand the development; even if I don't agree with their method of dealing with the issue.

PG is in the north it gets cold there, and as much as that isn't my cup of tea, at times when you are in the quite snow walking along on a sunny day or at night with a full moon, my goodness it is tranquil and beautiful. PG's climate has warmed an average 10 degrees C in January in the past 50 years (my supervisors data crunching) and like other places in the north that will continue more than other places. So I guess PG's climate won't be so cold, but then other problems arise like fires in the summer. Not much PG can do except densify and build fire breaks. Smoke season.

PG isn't in the most picturesque city, but if you want wild nature it is everywhere around. 1.5 hours to the east are the Rockies and a tonne of lakes around. Getting out of town is easy to see the stars at night too, like 5-10 mins. There is something to be said about being able to get out of town and away from anyone so quick. So many great views.

For jobs and housing. I'll say is that I have friends in PG that have got out of their masters or undergrads and bought a house on a lot in under a year. The employment prospects are excellent up there and housing costs are very reasonable. You can get ahead and keep ahead.

PG isn't my cup of tea, but it has opportunity to live a good life if you identify with the way of life. I know it was a light joke in the image, but it does cut us apart, especially when the comments reinforce things. PG is just the way it is because of it's history and its history isn't as ""fortunate"" like that of Victoria or Nelson or Kelowna. There is many good people there, like all over BC, and that if you aren't connected to the politics you can still find community. That honestly goes for all over BC. There are so many great places to live and explore, and communities to be part of. I love BC and I want us to be stronger and more connected together. :)",britishcolumbia,In defense of Prince George. :),0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/bwy2af/in_defense_of_prince_george/

Now the general aroma of my apartment is this unholy looming concoction of stale cigarettes and BO - especially when his bedroom door is open. The fact he showers about once per week doesn't help the matter. I've been living with this because I spend most of my time at work or in my room with the door closed, however my friends have mentioned the place is smelling increasingly worse. On the plus side, he always pays rent early 🤷‍♂️

Unfortunately I made him sign a lease agreement for 1 year based on some sensible boilerplate, but there is no clause in there requiring this grown ass adult to smell like a regular human being. I can't find anything to do with hygiene in the Tenancy Act as everything refers to the unit itself. I'm not sure if general odour is grounds to terminate the lease with notice. Is there anything I might be missing, or am I stuck rigging up Home Alone style Febreze™ traps for when the guy walks through the door from smoke breaks until his lease is up?

TL;DR: Roomie/tenant smokes more than originally thought. Apartment increasingly smells like BO and cigarette smoke because tenant got laid off and spends all day at home stinking up the joint.

**1. WHAT'S LEGAL**
----------------------
There are strict laws and regulations around the legalization of non-medical cannabis. Before you buy, use, or grow your own non-medical cannabis, learn more about what’s legal and what’s not.  
  
Medical cannabis is within the responsibility of Health Canada. To find out more, go to Health Canada.  
  _  
**Legal age**  
You must be 19 years or older to buy, use, possess, or grow non-medical cannabis in B.C.  
  _  
**Buying**  
To protect your health, keep young people safe and help prevent crime in your community, non-medical cannabis will be sold exclusively at government-run stores, licensed private retailers, and the B.C. government’s online store.  
  
The BC Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB) operates public retail stores and the online store. The list of public retail stores (BC Cannabis Stores), will be available on the BC Liquor Distribution Branch page. Online sales will be available only through the BC government online store. Private retail stores cannot offer online sales and delivery services for non-medical cannabis are not permitted.  
  
The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch is responsible for licensing and monitoring private retail stores. Licensed private retailers may sell cannabis and cannabis accessories. They may not sell liquor or tobacco or any items other than cannabis and cannabis accessories. The list of licensed retailers will be available on the BC Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch’s page. Licensed retailers will be required to display a valid licence where it is visible to the public.  
  
All legal non-medical cannabis has an excise stamp attached to its packaging. Federally-licensed producers and processors apply the appropriate excise tax stamp for British Columbia. If the product does not have a British Columbia stamp it is not legal for sale in B.C. Each province and territory has a different coloured cannabis excise stamp for products sold in their jurisdiction.  

*[B.C. cannabis excise stamp](https://cannabis.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/397/2018/10/bc-excise-stamp-01.png)*  
_  
**Possession**  
Adults 19+ can carry up to 30 grams of dried non-medical cannabis, or its equivalent, in a public place.  
  
In addition, adults cannot possess any more than 1,000 grams of dried non-medical cannabis, or its equivalent, in a non-public place, such as at your home. This limit is per household and is based on the expected yield from four cannabis plants.  
  _

**Public use**  
Adults 19+ can generally smoke or vape cannabis in public spaces where tobacco smoking and vaping are allowed. But remember, second-hand smoke can be harmful and irritating to people, especially children, so be mindful when smoking in public spaces.

Smoking and vaping cannabis are not allowed in the following public places:

* Playgrounds, sports fields, skate parks, swimming pools and spray pools, or any decks or seating areas associated these places  
* Public buildings, workplaces, or common areas of apartments, condos, or dormitories, and within six metres of air intakes, windows, and doorways attached to these places  
* Within six metres of bus stops, transit shelters, train stations, ferry docks and similar places
* Regional and municipal parks, except for designated campsites  
* Provincial parks, except for areas identified or designated  
* Public patios  
* Health board properties, except in designated smoking areas  
* Registered hotel guests may smoke or vape cannabis in their hotel room if the hotel allows it.  

Community care facilities, assisted living residences, and hospitals may designate specific rooms in which residents or patients can smoke or vape cannabis.  
  
Non-medical cannabis consumption (in all forms) is banned on K-12 school properties, as well as any adjacent sidewalks or boulevards. It’s also illegal for both driver and passenger(s) to consume non-medical cannabis in a car.  
  
Local and Indigenous governments can set additional restrictions on public use of non-medical cannabis under existing powers to establish bylaws.  
_

**Vehicles and boats**   
Non-medical cannabis consumption is generally not allowed in vehicles whether they are parked or moving, but there are some exceptions to this rule.    
  
It can be used in motorhomes or other motor vehicles, or campers, or trailers when being used as a private residence and parked off a public road or forest service road where camping is allowed.  
  
Cannabis can be transported in a vehicle as long as it’s in its original, unopened packaging, or is inaccessible to the driver and occupants (for example, in the trunk). In addition, a maximum of four non-medical cannabis plants can be transported in a vehicle, but they cannot be budding or flowering.  
  
Non-medical cannabis use is generally not allowed on boats. However, you are allowed to use non-medical cannabis on a boat that is moored or anchored if it has sleeping accommodations, a kitchen and a toilet.  
  
Non-medical cannabis use is allowed in a private cabin on a commercially operated boat if the operator allows it.  
_  
**Medical cannabis exemptions**  
There are exemptions for use of Health Canada authorized medical cannabis on school property and on inter-city buses, trains and boats as long as specific requirements are met. Details are available in the [Cannabis Control Regulation under Part 5 – Medical Cannabis](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0542_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?3#hit1).  
  _  
**Advertising and promotion**  
[There are strict federal rules around promotion of cannabis.](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/promotion-prohibitions.html)  
  
In addition, under provincial regulations, it is illegal for anyone without a retail license issued by the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch to advertise themselves as a licensed retailer. Also, no one can market, advertise or promote a place as a location to consume cannabis, or spend time after consuming cannabis.  
    
To find out more about the provincial rules regarding advertising and promotion see sections 36 and 37 of the [Cannabis Control Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0542_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?3%20-%20hit1) and section 9 of the [Cannabis Control and Licensing Transitional Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0541_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?1%20-%20hit1).    
  
**2. GROWING AT HOME**
----------------------

Growing cannabis plants at home is legal. Adults 19+ can grow up to four non-medical cannabis plants per household. These plants cannot be grown in a space that is visible from a public place, like parks, streets, sidewalks, sports fields, and K-12 school properties. For example, you can grow plants on your balcony, or in your yard, as long as they’re not visible from a public place.  
  
Growing cannabis at home is banned in homes that are licensed daycares.  
  
Landlords and strata councils can further restrict or prohibit growing non-medical cannabis on their properties.  
  
Local and Indigenous government can also further restrict growing non-medical cannabis at home under existing powers to establish bylaws.  
  
**3. TRAVEL**
----------------------  

There are strict rules and regulations around travelling with cannabis. Before you leave the province or country, get informed.  

**Travelling Internationally**  
It’s illegal to transport cannabis across the Canadian border. It doesn’t matter whether you’re leaving or entering Canada, or what the laws of your destination are. Bottom line: don’t cross the border with cannabis.  
  
[People who work in legal cannabis industry won’t be denied entry into U.S.](https://www.kelownanow.com/watercooler/news/news/Cannabis/People_who_work_in_legal_cannabis_industry_won_t_be_denied_entry_into_U_S/)  

The Government of Canada has important information you’ll need to know before travelling with cannabis. [Check out this video to learn more](https://youtu.be/UEIc7lxTwPA).   

**Travelling Between Provinces**
Cannabis laws are different between provinces and territories. This includes legal age, where you can smoke or vape, consume, and buy cannabis. Make sure to learn the laws before you travel. Check out the provincial and territorial websites for more details:

**4. LEGISLATION**
----------------------  
With public health and safety top of mind, the Province has passed legislation to provide legal, controlled access to non-medical cannabis in British Columbia:  

1. The [Cannabis Control and Licensing Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/18029) aims to protect children and youth, promote health and safety, keep the criminal element out of cannabis, keep B.C.’s roads safe, and support socially responsible economic development.  
1. The [Cannabis Distribution Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/18028) establishes a public wholesale distribution monopoly, and public (government-run) retail sales, both in stores and online.  
1. Recent changes to the [Motor Vehicle Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/lc/billscurrent/3rd41st:gov17-3) will give police more tools to remove drug-impaired drivers from the road and deter drug-affected driving.  

In addition, the Province has put the following new and amended regulations in place:  
  
* [Cannabis Licensing Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0528_2018)  
* [Cannabis Control Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0542_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?3#hit1)  
* [Cannabis Control and Licensing Transitional Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0541_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(cannabis\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?1#hit1)    
* [Amendment of Violation Ticket Administration and Fines Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0529_2018)  
* [Amendment of Provincial Sales Tax Exemption and Refund Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0532_2018/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:\(provincial%20sales%20tax\)%20AND%20CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ANCESTORS:641315258?1#hit1)  
* [Amendments to the Park, Conservancy and Recreation Area Regulation and the Conservation    Officer Service Authority Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0531_2018)

**5. SAFE COMMUNITIES**
---------------------- 
  
There are laws and regulations to keep your community safe. With public health and safety top of mind, the Province has passed legislation to provide legal, controlled access to non-medical cannabis in British Columbia.  

_  
**Growing Cannabis at Home**  
Adults 19+ can grow up to four non-medical cannabis plants per household. These plants cannot be grown in a space that is visible from a public place. Examples of public places include parks, streets, sidewalks, sports fields, and K-12 school properties. For example, you can grow plants on your balcony, or in your yard, as long as they’re not visible from a public place.  
   
Local and Indigenous governments can further restrict growing cannabis at home. Landlords and strata councils can also restrict or ban home-growing of non-medical cannabis on their properties.  
  
Growing cannabis is banned in homes that are licensed daycares.  
  
Learn more about [safety and security measures for growing plants](http://www.ncceh.ca/documents/evidence-review/growing-home-health-and-safety-concerns-personal-cannabis-cultivation).  
_  
**Buying and Selling Non-Medical Cannabis**  

Adults 19+ in B.C. can buy non-medical cannabis from government-run and private licensed retail stores, and the B.C. government’s online store. B.C.’s Liquor Distribution Branch provides wholesale cannabis to retail stores and operates public retail stores and online sales. The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch licenses and regulates private non-medical cannabis stores. The Province is developing a mandatory training program for non-medical cannabis retail employees. Training will ensure staff have the tools to educate consumers about responsible and lower risk use.  
  _  
**Cannabis in the Workplace**  
Public safety and health are vital to B.C. employers. And the Province has strong occupational health and safety regulations. Employers must determine if employees are fit for work. If an employee is impaired by cannabis at work, the employer must ask the impaired person to stop work and leave the grounds. WorkSafeBC encourages employers to use legalization of non-medical cannabis as an opportunity to assess how they manage workplace impairment issues.  
  
Employers can review the following resources:  
WorkSafeBC’s[ Substance Use and Impairment in the Workplace webpage](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/hazards-exposures/substance-use-impairment); [Workplace Strategies: Risk of Impairment from Cannabis](https://www.ccohs.ca/products/publications/cannabis/), a resource for employers developed by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety; and the[ Construction Industry of British Columbia Substance Abuse Testing & Treatment Program Policy](https://www.clra-bc.com/services/drug-alcohol-policy/), developed by the Construction Labour Relations Association of BC and the Bargaining Council of BC Building Trades Unions.  
  _  
**Tenants, Landlords and Strata Councils**    
Landlords and strata councils can restrict or ban growing and smoking non-medical cannabis on their properties as set out below.  
  _  
**Tenants and Landlords**  
The Residential Tenancy Act and Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act have been updated to reflect the following rule changes:  
  
* If tobacco smoking is banned in your tenancy agreement (lease or contract) entered into before October 17, 2018, this means that cannabis smoking is also banned
* All tenancy agreements entered into before October 17, 2018 will automatically ban growing non-medical cannabis at home
* For any new tenancy agreement after legalization, the landlord and tenant must negotiate whether those sections are included.  
  
Resources for Renters and Landlords:

* [Residential Tenancies in B.C.](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies)
* [Landlord BC](https://www.landlordbc.ca/#0)  
* [Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre](http://tenants.bc.ca/)  
* [BC Human Rights Tribunal](http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/human-rights-duties/housing/index.htm)     

_  

**Strata councils**  
Strata corporations considering making a bylaw to restrict or ban smoking or growing cannabis should seek legal advice. Learn more about[ getting legal advice on stratas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/more-help-and-support/getting-legal-advice).  


Many strata owners find it helpful to belong to a [strata association](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/more-help-and-support/strata-associations). These associations provide member support, resources and advice for a fee. Some information is freely available on the strata associations’ websites.  

For more[ information on how to accommodate the medical use of cannabis under Human Rights legislation](http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/human-rights-duties/housing/strata.htm), contact a strata association or a strata lawyer about the proper steps to take.  
  _  
**Local and Indigenous Governments**  

Local and Indigenous governments have the power to make decisions based on the needs and priorities of their communities including creating bylaws or other laws with respect to property, public health and safety and nuisances. Rules around where you can use or grow non-medical cannabis may vary from community to community. Some communities may choose to restrict these activities. In addition, the Province will not issue a licence to sell non-medical cannabis without support from the local government or Indigenous nation.  
  
To find out the rules and regulations in your community, please check with your local government or Indigenous government.    

  
**6. SAFE KIDS**
----------------------   
  
There are strict laws in place to protect children. You must be 19 years or older to buy, consume (through smoking, vaping and all other forms of consumption), possess or grow non-medical cannabis. Early and regular cannabis use is associated with higher risks of dependency and health problems.  
_  
**Youth**  
All children deserve to be safe, healthy, and protected from harm. That’s why the Province has taken important steps to protect youth and children from using non-medical cannabis at an early age.

In British Columbia,

* You must be 19 years or older to buy, consume (through smoking, vaping and all other forms of consumption), possess, or grow non-medical cannabis. Early and regular non-medical cannabis use is associated with higher risks of dependency and health problems later in life  
* Smoking or vaping cannabis is banned in areas where children and youth frequently hang out and play, including parks, sports fields and playgrounds  
* Consumption of non-medical cannabis (in all forms) is banned on K-12 school properties and on adjacent sidewalks and boulevards, in vehicles, and on boats while being operated  
* Youth under 19 years of age are banned from entering cannabis stores  
* It is an offence to sell or supply non-medical cannabis to individuals under 19 and there are strict penalties  
  
All packaging and labelling for cannabis is regulated by the federal government. Strict limits on the look and feel are intended to make it less appealing to youth.  

Youth will learn about substance use, including cannabis, in school from Kindergarten to Grade 10 through BC’s Physical Health Education curriculum. Topics include:  

* preventing personal harm  
* reasons people use drugs  
* physical, social, and emotional aspects of substance use  
* addiction and addictive behaviours   


_  
**Parents and Mentors**  

Parents and mentors play an important role in helping young people make healthy and informed decisions about cannabis. But talking to youth about cannabis can be difficult if you don’t know the facts.  
  
What do you need to know about cannabis?

**7. SAFE ROADS**
---------------------- 
  
Road safety is a priority for everyone. There are strict laws and regulations to keep our roads safe.  
  _  
**Drug-Affected Driving**  
Getting behind the wheel while impaired is not only dangerous, it’s illegal. Drug-affected drivers can face serious consequences like fines, licence prohibitions and jail-time. [Learn more about the federal laws and consequences here](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/policing/police/community-safety-policing/impaired-driving.html).  

British Columbia made changes to the Motor Vehicle Act, to provide police with more tools to address and deter drug-affected driving. Upcoming changes include zero-tolerance for the presence of drugs, such as THC, for new drivers in the province’s Graduated Licensing Program, and a 90-day administrative driving prohibition for any drug-impaired driver or driver with a blood drug concentration equal to or exceeding the legal limits under the Motor Vehicle Act.

_  
**Policing**    
Drug-affected driving is illegal. Police in B.C. are trained to detect and deter drug-affected driving and have multiple tools to investigate impaired driving. If a police officer suspects a driver’s ability to operate a motor vehicle is affected by a drug, including cannabis, or a combination of drugs and alcohol, the officer may require a driver to submit to a Standard Field Sobriety Test (SFST).  
  
Following the SFST, if the police officer believes that a person’s ability to drive is affected by a drug, or a combination of a drug and alcohol, the officer may require a person to:  
  
* Submit to a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) evaluation and provide a bodily fluid sample or;  
* The officer may make a demand for a sample of blood.

We have a guest at our motel (located at BC , Canada) who is supported by the ministry and is considered to be under RTA so we can't kick him out immediately for the disturbance/damages he has caused in the room and at the property.

At first , we called the police to kick him out , however , the police were saying this is a civil matter and that they can't do anything unless a proper notices and legal actions were taken.

So , we took legal action and gave the tenant 10 day notice for unpaid rent and after giving him the notice , the tenant's action of disturbance has been from yelling and screaming which is disturbing the guests and dropping by the front desk to yell at our staffs saying ""You guys don't know anything about the law and that I get to do whatever I want as long as I'm a paid tenant renting a room at this place""

Fast forward 10 day , we told him that he has to get out and he says he refuses to get out and that there needs to be a hearing for him to be officially kicked out. We called the police showing them the 10 day notice we served and it's past the effective date and again has told us that they can't do anything.

At this point , we aren't sure anymore as to what's right or if we can kick the tenant out anyway possible. We did serve him a 10 day notice and 30 day notice which we do have cases and evidences built for , but for the duration of extended stay he gets after the effective date is concerning us. We got a hearing date after filing a dispute and it's schedule to be at the end of June which is a 2 month he gets to stay at the room.

My question at the end of all this is , does the tenant get to do whatever they want as long as they are legally protected under the RTA? Many of things the tenant has been doing on daily basis goes on from disturbing other guests , smoking in the room , harassing our staffs and the owner , yelling constantly out of nowhere for 30 minutes and so forth.

He does not seem to be wary of the tenancy act as he is assisted by nurses from the hospital and that they are just telling him what to do and what actions to take which just further escalates and stresses the situation for us as it seems like the nurses are helping him squat in the room.

Sorry for the wall of texts , I'm just very confused/surprised/disappointed as to how the law works and not sure why the nurses are going so far to protect him stay in the room despite knowing his actions (there are multiple nurses and one of the nurses we are close with told us that they are all aware of the tenant as a mentally ill patient).

The reasoning behind this proposed moratorium is based on false pretenses and a complete lack of understanding of the industry, similar to the recent closure of Joffre Lakes Provincial Park.

The placer industry in BC is what actually made this a province.  It wasn't the fur traders it was the Fraser River gold rush that led to BC becoming a British colony and eventually a province.  Today, there are thousands of families and even entire communities such as the towns of Atlin, Likely, Wells and others that depend on this industry.

Modern mining, especially in BC, does zero harm to the environment.  Our reclamation standards are the highest in the world, much more restrictive than the Yukon for example.  This proposed moratorium will harm many families and communities in this province.

I realize that there are a lot of people in this province who are far removed from the natural resource industries that keep our economy moving.  NIMBYism is at an all-time high and that is not a good thing.  BC produces the cleanest gold in the world, if we stop producing placer gold our high-tech electronics, jewelry, and investment gold will have to be produced elsewhere such as third-world countries that are employing children and using toxic mining processes like mercury amalgamation.

Here's the background on the proposed moratorium:

The press release is filled with false information regarding the environmental harm of this type of mining.  None of those claims are true.  BC's permitting system is one of the strictest in the world and it already requires First Nations consultation along with environmental remediation.  BC's permitting system also requires reclamation bonds that are paid in advance as insurance that the reclamation work will be completed.

I'm hoping someone might be able to help or offer some advice.

I am booked to stay in Naramata this weekend and have been trying to cancel since the travel restrictions and state of emergency was issued for the Okanagan at the start of the week.

It was booked through booking.com. I have tried to contact and message the property multiple times explaining the situation but they won't answer or reply. I have also contacted booking.com directly but there is nothing they can do without consent of the property owner.

Is there anything more I can do? In my mind, since I am not allowed travel to the area and with the Provincial order requesting all short term rentals be free for first responder accommodation, a refund should be issued but as it stands, I still have to pay in full and accept the loss.

TL;DR: I come from a small town near Vancouver. I was driving in Richmond and received a ticket with two offences.

1. MV 214.2(1): Use electronic device while driving or operating a motor vehicle on highway
2. MV 25(15): Drive contrary to driver’s licence restrictions - too many passengers

This is my first ticket. The officer who wrote it mentioned two penalty points, contrary to ICBC materials available online.

Am I likely to undergo a licence suspension via the Driver Improvement Program?



Details:
I was driving in Richmond to assist two friends (they’re married) in getting their vehicle serviced by picking them up and dropping them off before and after the appointment.

I’ve had my Class 7N licence since May 2023, which I recently rushed to acquire as my mother is going through medical treatments that prevent her from working, buying groceries, and doing other errands. I have been driving at least three times a week since then. I never use my phone while on the road and only use pre-programmed routes on Google Maps through my car’s Bluetooth audio system for navigation—no visuals. I confirmed with the police officer that this is OK.

Upon leaving a parkade at Aberdeen Center, I gave my phone to my friend in the passenger seat and requested him to plan a route to the service location. There was no service in the parkade, so I left it to him.

At the traffic light outside Aberdeen, he stated the GPS wasn’t working and showed it to me. I looked, then moved swipe up to restart the app. Queue a shout from one of two ghost cars facing the opposite direction.

Upon confiscating our IDs and asking a few questions, the officer requested we turn around and park by their cars. We do so.

He asks for more information and I provide it. He writes a ticket and comes back and returns our ID and mentioned something about two penalty points. He instructs my friends to take an Uber and asks if we have any questions.

We ask for clarification on the rules with electronic devices and GPS and he explains that, as a Class 7N driver, so much as looking at an electronic device counts as using it, even if the passenger is operating it.

I understand. Both offences are deserved, and I am willing to pay the necessary fines. It’s my first ticket and I’m rattled to my absolute core, but so be it.

Later I search up the penalty points.

As it turns out, GLP drivers may only receive up to 4 DPP (penalty points) before having their licence reviewed by RoadSafetyBC, which can lead to a suspension. All online resources point to a distracted driving ticket counting for 4 DPP, leading to an immediate extra fine and review. This contradicts what the officer mentioned during the write-up.

I’m extremely concerned about the possibility of losing my licence; I’m the only able-bodied family member capable of driving.

How likely is this to happen? Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation?

I apologize for putting others at risk, I am aware distracting driving is the leading cause of motor-related deaths in BC.",britishcolumbia,GLP Class 7N Licence Suspension Risk,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/15iltbq/glp_class_7n_licence_suspension_risk/

I was charged $30 by Triton Services on my Telus bill because they said that my 16 yr old kid bought a years subscription of games. 

Ok maybe he’s capable of that (which is why I have restrictions on downloading apps and in-app purchases through the iPhone Screentime) but neither Triton nor Telus can provide any documentation that any charge confirmation text was sent or returned to my phone .

Both Triton and Telus blame each other and tell me to contact the other party.

The are a lot of similar complaints on the Telus and Koodo community threads, and Telus reps keep telling me they are receiving a lot of complaints about Triton (then maybe STOP PIMPING your customers by providing pass thru billing ?!)

Even if I get this sorted, what’s to stop them from doing it again with Triton or some other service ? Telus couldnt even tell me what other third parties they bill for, so that I can black list my numbers from their “services”.

Restriction on wood (it would cost them more insurance premiums, but not allowed as far as I can tell).

1. House is great, we love living here but can't afford that kind of increase.
2. Local rental market is insane, finding a new place will be very difficult

4. They have family ready to move in to evict me if needed. But not sure they can afford the whole 6 months without any rent (kids don't earn much). All they need to do is have a family member live in it for 6 months, correct?

I want to propose some restriction on *strawmanning*. To strawman someone is to misrepresent their argument in order to make it easier to attack. It tends to sabotage discussions. It appears to be a major cause of uncivil commentary around here.

Because it can sometimes happen unintentionally, I don't advocate a fully-enforced & complete ban on strawmanning here. But I think it's worthy of a warning from a moderator in all of the following cases.

* The strawman attack is very accusatory, and combined with an appeal to emotion.
* Double strawmanning: After the accused person replies to the strawmanner to clarify what they said, the strawmanner either does it again or denies that they strawmanned.

Those are cases in which I think there is no plausible deniability, and should always result in at least a warning. Temporary bans may be issued sparingly.

Of course, clarifying questions should not be regarded as strawmanning.

Full disclosure I am not from BC, however I have read that the BC health care system is having some struggles as well. 

Wanted to highlight a petition I have just found out about - it is to essentially highlight the state of our healthcare system and hopefully improve its quality. In greater detail, the petition calls on the federal government to;

1. Appoint a federal agency to audit and monitor federal health transfers allotment;
2. Restrict private capital from billing public health care facilities for profit;
3. Audit the Minister of Health's public health care funding mandates;
4. Conduct routine audits and consult with hospital boards and management of shortfalls and any attempt to underfund;
5. Receive and analyze health care service complaints from the public and reported attempts to force private for profit billing;
6. Monitor any bills passed by the province as a work around of the Canada Health Act and to limit and restrict fair compensation and health care standards;
7. Report conflicts of interest manipulating underinvestment and federal fund transfer allotment away from the universal public health care.

My wife and I have been in talks about moving into a 2 bedroom sometime after our 18-year-old cat, Casper, passes. I have super severe cat allergies that have been gradually getting worse and worse each year. We have another cat too; Yoshi is 10 but he is extremely high energy. He needs a companion that can match his energy level. I would love to rescue another kitten for him after Casper is gone but I have been congested, itchy, and short of breath for 31 years now as I was raised by cat and dog loving parents and stepparents. I love cats with all my heart and if I were to get another one in the future it would probably be a savannah or something, but I am trying to avoid the urge to adopt another cat all together. We are waiting to move due to the stress it causes Casper. I swear he gets more stressed about moving than I do.

There are not very many apartments that allow dogs but the ones that do tend to have a weight restriction on it. Trust me, as a lifelong rescue supporter, I would love to be able to get on the spca or other shelter website and make arrangements to meet many of the dogs there to find the ""One"" but the vast majority of dogs available for adoption are medium to large sized dogs. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of those dog friendly buildings I simply do not have that luxury, I grew up with large dogs so while I would give anything to be able to have big dog, I completely agree that an apartment is not the right environment for the big dogs I know and love. I had a dalmatian named Daisey, 2 rottweilers named Clink and Clank, a bull mastiff named Roscoe, a few German Shepards and black labs too. Needless to say, big dogs are my wheelhouse. 

I have done some googling to try and find reputable dog breeders in British Columbia but due to the way that google works and how the algorithm tends to put paid sites at the top I am pretty untrusting about the morality and reputation of the sites that pop up during my search. This is why I come to the general public. I hope to gain some more REAL information about breeders around the province that are NOT unsanitary puppy mills. I want happy and healthy breeders and dogs that have a great and loving life. I drive and also, I am obviously not looking to purchase a dog right now. I am hoping to have Casper live AT LEAST another year or two. 

Have you adopted a dog from a breeder in British Columbia? if so, can you please share the experiences you had while going through the process?

Do you know of any good breeders in British Columbia? Legitimate and documented breeders of course.

Please feel free to share any information you have regarding dog breeders in British Columbia, you would be an amazing help! Below I will provide the breeds of dog we are interested in that would fit the weight restrictions we have seen around at the complexes we were interested in moving to.

\- Schipperke  
\- Shetland Sheepdog (fourth choice)  
\- Norwegian Lundehund  
\- Japanese Spitz  


Again, I am a very experienced dog owner. My wife would be a first-time dog owner, but we are both very active people and will have plenty of time to invest in training and obedience training. We take multiple walks daily and look forward to including a new ember to the family in the future. Yoshi loves dogs and I know he would be very excited to have a new companion that can match his extremely high energy level. When the time comes, we will search for a small dog at the SPCA and other rescue organizations FIRST but as mentioned, there is a lack of smaller dogs to choose from.

With my husband we try to buy our first property, and currently live in White Rock. While we truly love this area, unfortunately the house prices are higher in here, which makes our situation more difficult. Recently we started to think about Maple Ridge, and today we went there to see some open houses. The first surprise was that the quality of the housing is much higher for the same price what we could get here in White Rock. Meaning in Maple Ridge we can get an almost new 3br townhouse, for the price which is enough for a 40years old building with 2br in White Rock. And the senior community restricts a lot of things here: children, pets and rentals and as a young couple, these are a high probability for us in the future, while in Maple Ridge it seems is not to be a problem at all.
We visited 5 apartments today and both of them were lovely, mostly near the Cottonwood Drive and Silver Walley. Everyone said it's an amazing starter point for young families, and we loved that the nature is so close. Especially that we don't have to commute, we both work from home.

But in the other side we've heard a lot that the center and the west area is pretty bad, and we stopped by on the way home to buy some food and it was a pretty good reality check, what's going on there which I truly did not like.

Me and my husband are thinking about buying our first home somewhere near Vancouver. 
Since we are both working from home (probably permanently), and have a car, our range can be wider, and it should be because as we see the prices are going up. We have a budget (with mortgage ofc) around 800k to buy something and our son is on the way to this world, so we would need to have 3 bedrooms.

We currently live in White Rock, which I truly love (and would love to stay if I could do) I am in love with the closeness of the ocean and this small town style, but apparently there is a gap between the apartments here, and there are a lot of small, and old apartments which are around 500k, obviously with senior communities and age restrictions, etc. And besides these everything what is bigger or newer is above a million...
We started to take a look in Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows too, but we are not very familiar with these places. 
What is important (besides the size of the apartment), that the city should be safe and in a quiet area (which means I don't want to be close to a highway or something). And it would be good to relative close to Vancouver, which means around a 1-1.5h drive.

My property is freehold, not condo/strata. The developer has placed a ""Statutory Building Scheme restrictive covenant"" on the title to every property (over 800 homes) that dates back to the origins of the development in the early 1990's. The design covenant binds homeowners to follow certain rules about the look of homes (initial design, paint colour, fences, landscaping standards, etc.) and use of the property (no rental units, rules for parking boats and RVs, etc). The restrictive covenant also requires that all exterior modifications to our homes be approved by the developer. The covenant document is vague on what constitutes an exterior modification. This is probably intentional to give the developer more control.

The issue is that quite a few homeowners want to install solar panels, but the developer refuses to allow it (""they are ugly, they don't fit in, nobody likes them""). If we proceed to do it anyway, we risk being sued by the developer and possibly having to remove the panels. The developer has deep pockets and has taken similar action in the past. They have also allowed a patchwork of changes and exceptions to the rules over the years, but they maintain every decision is case-by-case and approving something is not a precedent for any future issue.

The developer has stated they will approve ""solar tiles"" which are much smaller than panels and are designed to mimic the look traditional roofing materials. They look great because they really blend in.  Two popular examples are from Tesla (not available in Canada yet) and Ergosun. The problem with solar tiles is that they cost 300% more than solar panels in a retrofit situation, and 200% more than panels for new construction (these numbers are based on actual quotes). I think most reasonable people would agree that there is no scenario in which this would make any sense financially. Solar tiles are an ultra-premium, niche product and most people faced with the choice of tiles over panels will choose panels based on cost alone.

Many of us who live here feel the vague wording of the covenant gives the developer far too much power over our homes. New homes are still being built in this development, and they are also not allowed to include solar panels. At a time when climate change is on everyone's mind, all levels of government are supporting green initiatives with various incentives, and the cost of solar panels keep dropping, over 800 homeowners are being denied the opportunity to do something tangible and useful to address climate change and take advantage of free energy from the sun.

That said, nobody is suggesting the covenant be scrapped. We appreciate that the cohesive look and high upkeep standards we enjoy in our community are largely due to the covenant. We're hoping to convince the developer that the position they have taken on this single issue is misguided. It's like saying, ""You're allowed to park a car your driveway as long as it's a Bentley."" Solar tiles are not viable if they are the only option.

Interestingly, this is a common issue in the US. Quite a few US states have implemented  [“solar rights” laws](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2021/rpt/pdf/2021-R-0185.pdf) that prohibit condos, stratas, HOA's, developers and municipalities from banning installation of solar energy devices on rooftops or properties.  As far as I am aware, we don't have such legislation anywhere in Canada.

I'm looking for input from anyone (especially in BC) who has experience challenging such a restrictive covenant either legally or with persuasion, whether successful or not.

We originally wanted to move to Fernie, but unfortunately my husband wasn’t considered for a couple of jobs he had applied to (he’s and Red Seal Electrician). I work from home so location doesn’t affect my work.

Now, we are forced to look at other options and we’re unsure of where to go. There are lots of job opportunities in Prince George, but we’ve never been there. There are other opportunities in places like Invermere, Grand Forks, Creston, and Penticton, all of which we’ve driven through, but never struck me as somewhere we could live.

We are not “party people” but we do like going out for drinks at a restaurant. We love the outdoors - hiking, snowshoeing and downhill skiing is a must near where we live. We want to pick up downhill mountain biking too, so a place that has that as an option is a bonus!

With inflation at an all-time high and an increased cost of living, why has the provincial government not stepped in and request the removal of these fees at regional parks, but also at the provincial parks it manages? In the case of Metro Vancouver, it is not acceptable to impose parking fees on regional parks without considering the impacts of the new policies on the community. Low-income families are impacted the most, and the general public's access to green space and nature is reduced due to an added financial cost.

Some potential options include:

* Imposing timed parking restrictions (3-4 hours) OR imposing reasonable parking fees during high peak times only to encourage high parking turnover.
* Removing parking restrictions on weekdays. The parking lots are close to empty Monday through Friday and on rainy days (almost every day this spring). Allow locals to enjoy their regional parks without having to pay a fee.
* Provide day passes, through reservations, to those who want to go on long day hikes in the area.
* Increase taxes by $5. More money at once = better maintenance opportunities and funding available. Also, less financial pressure on those who want to use parks often but can’t afford to. 

It is evident that the response from Metro Vancouver in imposing parking fees was reactive and only intended to address the concerns of the wealthy living near these destinations. For example, the Village of Belcarra has recently installed ""no parking, except with permit"" signs on every single street to provide their entire neighbourhood with an added level of ""protection"" from park visitors. Exclusionary policies like these are unacceptable, but that is another conversation and topic that requires further discussion.

All levels of government across the country deployed health measures to slow the spread, and the re-emergence, of the coronavirus throughout the year.

Here are some key highlights for **British Columbia**:

I figured they would get a lot of support because I know a lot of us are ready to get back to their normal lives after 2 years of covid etc. One thing I didn't realize would happen is the very people who supported the Farmers protests, BLM protests, Pipeline protests & Indigenous protests are all 10000% opposed to this protest for some odd reason.

We can see that ""peaceful protest"" actually did accomplish a lot in terms of bringing awareness to policing issues around the world and the current climate for racism in certain people etc. BLM was able to raise millions of dollars and help bring attention to HBCUs in the states and have media/pop culture pay attention to what they were saying. The indigenous protests after the discovery of remains ALSO was able to bring awareness to issues plaguing our first nations. Government at all levels are starting to try and work towards making amends for all of their past horrors. The farmers protests were able to get Modi to call of his rules that would have effected their day to day lives.

Why is it that when this group decides to mobilize and have their voices heard they are called racists, white trash, scumbags and anti vaxxers etc? I find nothing wrong with any protest really as long as things remain peaceful. If they feel that they want to get rid of all current restrictions and are voters/citizens of this country then they are allowed to have their voices heard by government. We shouldn't label them as terrible people because they have a message that is opposite of what your beliefs are. This country was founded on the principle of living in harmony with people with different views/opinions. Just because you don't agree with the message doesn't make them any less able to spread it.

My family has been renting this unit for over 10 years now and it is a very old property. It is in a townhouse complex, and it is clear that ours is not as modern or up to date as the others in the area. We routinely have plumbing problems which our landlord has been good about reimbursing us for, but they have continued nonetheless. This December, my family left for three weeks to visit our extended family for the holiday and in preparation for the cold and extended absence, we left the thermostat on to 23 degrees and one of the taps dripping water (we pay our own utilities and have been advised to do these things on account of the plumbing and insulation being poor). When we came back in early January we found the whole house had basically imploded- the pipes had burst causing our toilets and showers to leak, damaging the whole unit. Our landlord started emergency repairs and we have been living in a hotel since (about two weeks now, paying for it ourselves) as we have no running water now. Landlord told us to find another place to live as soon as possible due to repairs taking a long time. However, the plumber working on it says running water was ready to be turned on a week after the incident and landlord just isn't giving him the green light to do so, and he refuses to be in a three way conversation with the plumber and my mom, and he told my mom the plumber doesn't know what he is talking about. My mom also got covid during this and he wouldn't turn the water on to let my mom quarantine there as he doesn't believe in covid and stuff, so she had to segregate herself to a corner of the hotel room as we couldn't afford another one for her. He is also refusing to put any of this in writing. We also have rent and utilities paid for the month, but he isn't technically restricting access to the house- it is just un-livable due to the lack of running water. He  is claiming that this is our fault as we should have left the thermostat on higher and because one of the bathroom windows were cracked open (< 1 inch, we do this for ventilation). We have a house we found to move into for February, but rent is very high in our area right now. What is the course of action here? Is he supposed to reimburse us for our hotel stay? What about our rent for the month? I feel like even if you do leave the house without the thermostat on and it shouldn't implode.

In short, posts and comments need to be:

- **Relevant to B.C.**
- **Productive**
- **Accurate**

Another thing worth noting is how **burdens of proof** work when making claims in posts or comments. This concept is discussed at the end of this post.

Thanks for reading and participating in the sub, and have a great week!

#Relevant to B.C.

COVID posts that are most well-suited to the purpose of this subreddit include:

- **COVID news specific to B.C.**
- **COVID questions specific to B.C. that can't be answered by a Google search**
  - If you have questions about COVID regulations, testing, vaccination, and more, the site you want is the [provincial government's website on COVID-19 response](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/response).
  - If the provincial website doesn't answer your question, Google should be your next stop.

#Productive

Posts that appear to only be a magnet for people who'd like to complain about restrictions, vaccine requirements, or government officials are generally not super productive.

All of us are tired, and all of us are frustrated. The term for this is ""pandemic fatigue"", and it is a global phenomenon. Be that as it may, we're trying to avoid the subreddit becoming a cesspool of negativity, and we may remove certain posts that don't appear to be aimed at productive discussion.

#Accurate

Posts and comments on the sub need to be factually accurate. Content that is most likely to be kept up are posts from news agencies with **published standards of journalistic integrity**. These include [CBC](https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/vision/governance/journalistic-standards-and-practices), [Global News](https://globalnews.ca/pages/principles-practices/), [CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/editorial-standards-and-policies), and others on a case-by-case basis. Also encouraged are press releases from the provincial government, as these are inherently relevant to the sub's purpose.

Please note: **Articles labeled ""Editorial"" or ""Opinion"" may not conform to usual standards of journalistic integrity, and tend to be inflammatory in nature.** If you're posting one of these articles, some of the information may not be presented as transparently as it would be on a non-editorial or non-opinion piece, and that may lead us to remove that content. This is largely dependent on the type of response the article gets in the reply threads, and whether or not things are likely to go off the rails.

#**Burdens of Proof**

A common problem we're experiencing in combating misinformation is something like the following interaction, which I've made up as an example:

>Pfizer's vaccine makes people more likely to experience fried chicken cravings!

>That's not accurate.

>Oh, yeah? Prove it's misinformation.

This is not how things work.

When you make a claim, it is *your responsibility* to support the claim with evidence. This is called the ""burden of proof"", and when you make a claim, that burden is yours to bear. Asking (or demanding) other people to disprove your claim is called a ""burden of proof fallacy"" (logical flaw), and is a concept explained very well in [this article](https://effectiviology.com/burden-of-proof/#The_burden_of_proof_fallacy).

The reason this approach to arguments is logically flawed is because certain claims literally can't be disproven. For example, there are no available studies to disprove the claim that Pfizer's vaccine makes you crave fried chicken. That's why it's important that when you make a claim, you need to support it, and not rely on other people to prove you wrong.

If you make claims in posts or comments that aren't proven and ask other people to disprove you (instead of proving the value of your claim, yourself), your post or comment may be removed.",britishcolumbia,COVID-19 Content and Moderation on r/britishcolumbia,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/s1svee/covid19_content_and_moderation_on_rbritishcolumbia/

I'm wondering what everybody's honest opinion is on the gym restrictions.

Everyone around me, vaccinated or not, is of the opinion that gyms should still be open now for the vaccinated. I'm triple vaccinated myself and I believe it should still be open to maintain peoples' mental and physical health.

There is an [online petition](https://www.change.org/p/john-horgan-keep-bc-s-gyms-open) going around with close to 22,000 signatures now in support of easing the restriction on gyms for the vaccinated population. 3,000 signatures of which are from the past 3 hours.

1. I’m quite biased against unvaccinated, and it was wrong to call them selfish in the title. IMO those making the personal choice not to get vaccinated are putting their opinion/fear ahead of the collective good. I should have reflected on the difference between being selfish and doing something deemed selfish. It was insulting and I’m sorry. 
2. My initial motivation (unfair general restrictions) turned into an annoyance towards unvaccinated people. Many said I wanted to punish them; that wasn’t my point but I can see why they’d think that.
3. I implicitly blamed unvaccinated people for spreading the virus. I actually don’t believe that, but I see how my words blurred the line and I see why it would come across that way. 
4. While I’ve been ok with restrictions and lockdown for the past 22 months, I’m finally annoyed at the inconsistency of the restrictions
5. I focused on temporary restrictions while the real problem is the worldwide pandemic. That’s what needs to guide our decisions. 
6. Ultimately my OP was an I’ll-prepared rant: I vented my frustration thinking I could win with logic, and all I did was to share biased opinion and make everybody more upset. I’m sorry. 

I’m leaving my OP here but I’m moving on now. Thank you for those who contributed respectfully. 

—— below is the original post
TL;DR: the government should make the unvaccinated people bear the cost of their decisions, instead of punishing the 83% of British Columbians who did their duty. 

They say we will all get exposed to omicron, which seems to easily infect vaccinated people. 
Omicron appears to cause only mild sickness for vaccinated people; if correct then omicron is dangerous only to unvaccinated people. 

Dr Bonnie Henry said we need to flatten the curve to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system but it’s not clear omicron would do that as hospitalization remains low in South Africa after 4 weeks. 

Many of us did the right thing by getting vaccinated in the hope that we can try and move on, and now we have to (once again) accept restrictions which in fact only save unvaccinated people. 

If the government doesn’t dare making the vaccine mandatory, then they should at least make life harder for the unvaccinated ones. 
I don’t care if I’m asked for my QR vaccine card everywhere, so make us show it in the bus, coffee shops, ferries, etc. 
Stop accommodating the minority of selfish people who don’t care if their choices endanger the community. 
I don’t want to pay for them. 

Canada has bought more vaccine per capita than any other country in the world. 
Shame.

Jokes aside though, considering the social media age we live in, we are living through times that nobody has lived through before, or could have ever expected. Many of us have lived our lives with goals and ambitions that we have had to completely rethink, because it's quite evident that the world will never be the same as it was before. Ultimately, since the pandemic hit, we have been hit again and again with uncertainty, restrictions, easing of restrictions, economic instability, more restrictions, more uncertainty, and overall hopelessness of the world going back to what it was before. What a time that was! 

One thing I have noticed through this whole ordeal is that when you talk to people, see posts on social media, and see the overall narrative of what's going on, there has consistently been a societal need to blame *somebody.* People who didn't follow the rules and held parties. People who didn't wear masks, or didn't believe in them. People who didn't get vaccinated. People who didn't get their second dose of the vaccine. People who didn't get the booster. People who travelled internationally. Government who didn't make strict enough rules. Government who made the rules too strict. *Somebody* was to blame for all this. 

As we approach the 2 year mark, it's important to reflect on two things: one - that the need to blame someone for something that is inevitable is a problem. Seeing Canucks games get cancelled, in a league where all players, staff, and fans need to be vaccinated, shows that no matter what we try to do, this virus is here to stay.. and that's the way it always will be. Can we pump the brakes on always needing to blame someone for what's happening? International travel is not permitted unless you are vaccinated. So how did the Omicron variant get into our country then, if vaccinated people brought it here? It's time to stop blaming the unvaccinated for everything that is going on, and realize that no matter what we do, this virus is here to stay. 

The second thing that I need to mention, is that we need to realize and understand that COVID will never go away, but we absolutely cannot continue with this fear that is limiting our ability to enjoy life with the optimism that ""one day things will be back to normal."" Vaccines, masks, restrictions.... and we're shutting things down again? It's been 2 years.. when will we start realizing that this is not going to end and just start allowing people to live life at their own risk? I'm all for limiting the ability of unvaccinated people to participate in certain things.. fine. But for those of us who follow protocols and are vaccinated, why are we cancelling NYE celebrations and limiting the amount of people who can get together for a party? 

Overall message: We need to realize that the need to blame others for something that is out of our control is a problem. And that COVID will never go away and we should be able to live our lives at our own risk.",britishcolumbia,The Need to Blame Others: What COVID Has Taught us about Human Psychology,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/rjpbtd/the_need_to_blame_others_what_covid_has_taught_us/

Excerpt from the BC MOT website: 

## HOLIDAY TRAVEL 

*Safety is always our number one priority. As we work to reopen the Coquihalla to commercial traffic (now targeted for early January), we must leave Highway 3 and Highway 99 under*[ *the essential travel order*](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/natural-disaster/support/restrictions) *until that is possible.*

*With upwards of 3,000 trucks a day now on Highway 3, with its steep grades and tights curves, we simply cannot and will not mix in leisure passenger traffic. Further, Highway 99 presents its own unique challenges, with very steep grades, very tight corners and very narrow stretches which is why it will remain restricted to  essential travel for only vehicles up to 14,500kg licensed GVW.*

*NOTE – There are options for bus transportation from the Lower Mainland to Kelowna and Kamloops through companies like Ebus, Rider Express and Mountain Man Mike Bus Service.*

*Once we get the Coquihalla reopened for commercial trucks, we can look at making Highway 3 and possibly Highway 99 available.*

It's sad, because I think many people, myself included, were hoping the situation would change before Christmas, but I completely understand why they're doing this. 3,000 trucks a day on that tiny highway is terrifying to think about.

To help keep people safe and re-establish the movement of critical goods and services following severe flooding and landslides, the Province is taking temporary measures to ensure fuel (gas and diesel) is prioritized for essential vehicles, while keeping it available to British Columbians.

Measures to restrict non-essential travel to and from impacted areas are also being introduced.

“We are asking people to limit their fuel consumption and vehicle travel at this time and are putting in place orders under the provincial state of emergency to support this,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “These steps will keep commercial traffic moving, stabilize our supply chains and make sure everyone gets home safely. We are asking people not to travel through severely affected areas – for their own well-being, but also to make sure the fuel we do have goes toward the services people need in this time of crisis.”

Farnworth has issued two new orders using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The first brings in a temporary order to ensure fuel remains available for essential vehicles in affected areas of the province.

This order, effective immediately, until Dec. 1, 2021, applies to all fuel suppliers in the Lower Mainland-to-Hope region, the Sea-to-Sky region, Sunshine Coast, the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island.

Under this order, essential vehicles will have unrestricted access to fuel as required, using predominately commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations). A full list of these essential vehicles is available in the backgrounder.

Non-essential vehicles, including the general public, will still have access to fuel available through retail gas stations. People will be limited to 30 litres per trip to the gas station. 

The Province will be working with gas retailers and distributors to implement this order to make sure people are not exceeding their allotted limit per trip. As part of this order, gas retailers will be required to ensure remaining gasoline reserves last until Dec. 1, 2021. Anyone who is abusive, threatening or belligerent to gas station workers can be subject to a fine under the order.

“When our province is faced with an emergency, British Columbians step up,” Farnworth said. “We have a steady supply of gas to support all our essential vehicles and we will get through these restrictions together by staying calm, only buying what we need and looking out for each other. These measures are necessary during temporary shortages as work is under way to re-establish B.C.’s fuel supply.”

Under the order, retail gas stations and wholesale distributors will be prohibited from profit-margin price gouging and people will be prohibited from buying gas for the purpose of reselling it.

These restrictions will ensure a steady fuel supply to British Columbians, while efforts are undertaken to fix damage to roadways, establish alternative access to fuel through new routes, and re-establishing the flow of fuel through the Transmountain Pipeline that has been offline as a result of the recent weather events.

The order does not affect natural gas or heating oil used to heat homes.

The second order prohibits non-essential travel along severely affected highways:

* Highway 99: from the junction of Highway 99 and Lillooet River Road to the BC Hydro Seton Lake Campsite access in Lillooet. Only passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles up to 14,500 kilograms will be permitted.
* Highway 3: from the junction of Highway 5 and Highway 3 in Hope to the west entrance to Princeton from Highway 3.
* Highway 7: from the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 9 in Agassiz to the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 1 in Hope.

This order will be in effect starting today as these highways start to reopen. It applies to non-essential travel along specific sections of highways between the Lower Mainland and Interior of British Columbia. There are circumstances where travel is essential and permitted, specifically for the movement of any goods that are necessary for the health, safety and well-being of British Columbians. (A full list follows in a backgrounder.) As the backlog of essential traffic clears, restrictions on essential travel can be eased.

These measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency, using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act. The act allows the minister to implement all procedures the minister considers necessary to prevent, respond to or alleviate the effects of an emergency, including controlling or prohibiting travel to or from any area of British Columbia.

***Essential vehicles defined***

The following vehicles will have access to commercial gas stations where available fuel will be prioritized. For vehicles that do not typically access commercial trucking gas stations (cardlock gas stations), the Province is working to provide priority access.

The groups are defined as:

* Emergency service vehicles (fire, police, ambulance and health care including urgent medical treatment)
* Public transit vehicles
* Commercial transport trucks – critical goods and services (food and beverage, health care, safety)
* Refrigerated trucks
* Potable water delivery/wastewater service
* Grocery delivery
* Road repair, maintenance and recovery vehicles/tow trucks
* Military vehicles
* Critical infrastructure, construction and repair vehicles
* Home-care workers
* Municipal services vehicles
* First Nations government services vehicles
* BC Ferries/Coast Guard/tugboats/marine emergency/pilot boats
* Canada Post and other couriers/package delivery vehicles
* Vehicles for the provision of critical government services
* Airport authority vehicles and air travel
* Waste disposal/recycling
* BC Hydro, Fortis and other heavy-duty and light-duty utility vehicles
* Telecommunication repair and installation vehicles
* Fuel delivery trucks and boats
* School buses
* Taxis
* Agricultural and farm-use vehicles, including vehicles supporting flood response
* Veterinarians supporting flood response
* Inter-city buses

***Defining essential travel, goods and services in B.C.***

This order applies to non-essential travel. It does not apply to:

* commercially transporting goods
* transporting essential goods and supplies, specifically:
   * food, water and other beverages
   * fuel and gasoline
   * health-care goods, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies
   * personal hygiene, sanitation and cleaning goods.
* transporting livestock, agricultural or seafood products and supplies
* livestock producers returning to a farm to provide care for animals
* responding to emergencies, including search and rescue operations
* evacuations for medical reasons and urgent medical treatment
* highway repair and maintenance
* transporting essential personnel
* returning to a person’s own principal residence
* exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right as recognized and affirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.",britishcolumbia,"Provincial government prioritizes fuel for essential vehicles, introduces travel restrictions -",0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qxstn7/provincial_government_prioritizes_fuel_for/

My  singe-family home is not a condo or strata and there is no home owners association (HOA) or equivalent. However there are ""community design""  bylaws on the title. In general terms, I am restricted from altering the appearance or structure of my home without approval from the developer,  to ensure there is a cohesiveness to the community. I was aware of this when I bought my house and I am generally supportive of the rules because it results in a beautiful place to live!

I  would like to install solar panels on the rear of my home (faces  southwest). They would not be visible from the street and only partially  visible by a few neighbours at the rear. On the surface it seems very  clear that solar panels would alter the appearance of my home and  require approval from the developer. But I have reason to believe the  developer will not approve even though they would not be visible from  the street.

There are  jurisdictions in the US (Arizona, for example) in which state law  prohibits HOAs or community design bylaws from outright preventing  installation of solar panels or effectively prohibiting them by making  them too expensive or complicated to install. Solar panels are  considered a utility in these jurisdictions.

So  my question is: does any such law exist in Canada or BC that would  enable me to install solar panels and render this provision of the  community design bylaw unenforceable?",britishcolumbia,Legal question re: installation of solar panels in BC,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/qitw33/legal_question_re_installation_of_solar_panels_in/

The ONLY proven and studied policies that has successfully stopped COVID breakouts are ones that **limit social gatherings** (for which BC has had some of the hardest restrictions on the continent). The rate of community transmission has always been very low.

When BC first introduced the mask mandate, numbers continued to grow at the same rate for over a month. There was no tangible difference in COVID cases after it was implemented. **Masks are at best, a very soft safety net** that will become useless if kids/coworkers start eating with each other. The risk of a COVID exposer grows exponentially when people are eating with one another (for obvious reasons)

But this is more of a surrender than a strategy. Without masks and other restrictions, covid-19 will continue to spread even within vaccinated populations.

This is irresponsible and goes against [what the world's experts are telling us](https://youtu.be/RzyGv81Ffz0).

Specifically, I'm wondering if you were told at the border to quarantine until getting results from your covid arrival test or if that's not necessary.

I know it can take several days for these test results to be processed and it would make a big difference if I didn't have to quarantine during that time.

#What is it?#
It's a collection of chat rooms specifically for BC folk who want a little more *social* in their social lives.

#How's it work?#
Click [the link](https://discord.gg/qPMj39RFrg), say hi, and start meeting new friends.  You can run Discord either in your browser or download and install the application to your computer / phone.  Completely free and pretty darn easy.

The server is divided into chat rooms based on topics of interest, like #videogames, #food-n-cooking, and #hockey, etc.  There's even the age-restricted #adults-only room for those who like that sort of thing.  :)  Drop into the rooms that interest you and meet others in your area with the same interests.  There's something for everyone, but in case there isn't, stop by the #suggestions room and propose a new topic!

#Why?  What's the point?#

Every week or so there's another post in one of the BC subreddits saying something like ""How do you make friends here?"" or ""Hi, I'm new, looking for friends!""  I've moved more than 15 times across three countries and this is a situation that I've been in many times myself.  Everywhere I went, to make friends I started looking for groups to join or, if there were no groups, I started them myself.  That that's what this is, a first step to bring people together around common interests to help people be social and maybe make a few new friends.

That’s right, today I’m talking about the N drivers restrictions and how absurd it is.
Im pretty sure most of you know about the rules but for those of you who don’t , [the restriction I’m doing my project on and want it to change is the one where it only allows you to have one passenger at a time, unless it’s your family members. 
Isn’t that ridiculous?
[It’s like giving wings to a bird but not letting it fly.
The reason behind this is because they believe you’re more likely to get distracted if you’re driving with your friends. But how does it change with your family? They’re not going to distract you because they’re your family? I mean if anything having more passengers might be useful . They can help you with technology and  finding directions.  And some Other benefits might be : less cars in street, less traffic, less pollution , less money on gas and even less drunk drivers.
You asking how?
Let’s say you’re at a party and everybody is drinking but you aren’t ,because you’re driving. 4 of your best friends has been drinking and ask you for a ride. What are you supposed to do? Just leave all of your friends and pick one And let the others risk their life and the life of others by driving under the influence?Or you can give them a ride j and  get a 109$ ticket and risk getting your license suspended . Just like me.Either way it doesn’t make sense to me.
Either way it’s stupid .
And either way it’s more damaging than beneficial
You should be able to drive whoever you want after getting your license without breaking the law.
That’s why this restriction needs to be lifted .

But, sometimes i see a 55+ mobile park home for sale and altho much smaller, less maintenance , possibly less noise or issues with young people and other positives/negatives.

This particular mobile home i noticed online is frickin gorgeous and only about $130,000 for 987 sq ft, 2 bdrm, 1 bth . The way it is styled inside and out blows me away and i wonder if i could live in a place such as this.

So here is the thing: You do not own your own lot. You pay a PAD fee....of $667 per month.

Is that good? Do these pad fees increase year to year and can they skyrocket?

Since a owner pays a pad fee, that mean no property taxes? or regardless, you pay property tax on the structure?

Are these 55+ mobile home parks a happy and safe investment for long term living? Or am i missing out on the big picture? It sure does look very nice and enticing.... like to read feedback, positives and negatives to consider on this type of living lifestyle.

Here are a few highlights for British Columbia:

* In British Columbia, GDP decreased 3.8%, the largest contraction since the 1982 recession, as 15 of 20 industrial sectors posted lower output in response to COVID-19 restrictions and shutdowns.
* The decline was almost entirely driven by services-producing industries (3.75 of 3.83 percentage points), with the decline in goods-producing industries the smallest among all provinces. 
* Government-imposed restrictions on travel impacted air transportation (-72.5%), urban transit systems (-47.6%) and support activities for transportation (-22.8%).

Nos nouvelles données sur le produit intérieur brut (PIB) par industrie pour les provinces et les territoires rendent compte des répercussions de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur l’activité économique du Canada en 2020. 

Voici quelques points saillants pour la Colombie-Britannique :

* En Colombie-Britannique, le PIB a diminué de 3,8 %; il s’agit du plus grand recul depuis la récession de 1982, la production ayant diminué dans 15 des 20 secteurs d’activité en raison des restrictions et des fermetures liées à la COVID-19.
* La baisse a été presque entièrement attribuable aux industries productrices de services (3,75 des 3,83 points de pourcentage), car la diminution enregistrée par les industries productrices de biens a été la plus faible de toutes les provinces. 
* Les restrictions de voyage imposées par le gouvernement ont eu une incidence sur le transport aérien (-72,5 %), les services urbains de transport en commun (-47,6 %) et les activités de soutien au transport (-22,8 %).

I speak for the majority of people on this and I get that the Govt's are in un-precedented times with no-one prepared for this but why are BC's restrictions so incredibly loose? It is really annoying how you can potentially go (and people do) from Vancouver to anywhere in the region, let alone Fraser to meet people for recreational purposes (meet 10 ppl for a bbq no less) They say to stick to your neighbourhoods but "" We won't punish you if you don't"" It is bad enough having 5 people sitting at a picnic table shoulder to shoulder sharing drinks, food and joints with no masks but the fact you can do that in any neighbourhood within Van or Fraser is rather ridiculous. I know you can't enforce it, but why are they saying "" Up to 10 people / Van and Fraser are a combined health region"" rather than "" Please stick to your neighbourhoods and people from your household (which is kinda what they imply , while allowing looser restrictions)"" Also, why on earth would they combine those 2 regions when even travelling far within your own region is absurd for recreational purposes (unless of course you are camping with your family in the middle of nowhere) - I know you can not enforce it but they are doing a terrible job of discouraging it. Why on earth did they loosen it to 10 people lol.. they have shot themselves in the foot on that one. 

Classic example: my workmate lives in Kits, he was super excited (obeying the restrictions) he could visit his GF in Surrey... went there, his GF's friend had symptoms and his GF is around that friend all the time and was "" not feeling great"" - My work colleague is now off work because he is not feeling the best. It is pretty much what everyone knows happens,  but the Govt just doesn't seem to care.

It's going to look like we're going on vacation, even though we will also have a packed van full of boxes and plants.

We have some money set aside for a hotel if we can't get on the ferry right away because we can't even stay with friends or family because they're not in our bubble.

&#x200B;

I'm currently working on a pulp mill in the interior and I can't help but feel like things aren't being taken seriously anymore. It's clear that these businesses are only concerned with *liability* not our actual *safety*.  We're being crammed into exceedingly small trailers, single bathroom to use for more than 40 staff members. With up to 800 people on site, I can only assume its the same situation for every other crew. The parking has been restricted dramatically and the shuttle buses into site are packed. But, when on site, they have teams of two auditing everyone for PPE. N95 of KN95 masks are required **only** when riding the elevator. Beyond that, they require some sort of face covering when on site but medical masks are not required. 

I guess my point is that it seems that we, as laborers, are being used in a way that allows these businesses to gamble with our health and safety. They want to look good for WCB and Worksafe but have no interest in keeping us safe.

I wrote a letter to ICBC's Fair Practise account, expressing my concern:

---

> To whom it may concern:
>  
> I am writing to formally complain about a policy regarding the Class 6 Learners license, and time restraints due to COVID. I had called this afternoon, and received a call back from a representative of ICBC, and this person was very helpful and friendly. However, this person had to inform me about some loss of privileges, due to time.
>  
> In May, 2020, I renewed my 6L, and purchased a motorcycle to test with. I took my skills test, and passed the second time on July 27, 2020. I have been riding by myself ever since. I had also been looking, almost daily until Fall, for an appointment for my full road test - none were available in Prince George, Vanderhoof, Quesnel, Mackenzie or Kamloops. I gave up looking.
>  
> This past week, I started looking again. Seeing that my license is expiring in May, 2021, I looked online to see if I can renew, but the web site says I must write my knowledge test again. Fair enough, I booked an appointment for the end of April to do so. I could not see any open Road Test slots in Prince George, Vanderhoof, Quesnel or Mackenzie, so I called in today to inquire - are motorcycle road tests even taking place?
>  
> The person on the phone was very professional and friendly; this letter in no way should indicate they did anything wrong from the customer's point of view. He searched for appointments, and saw one was available for June. I thought that was great, and asked if it could be booked. He attempted to, but his system wouldn't allow it - since my license expires in May. Again, not his fault. I explained that I was going for a renewal in April, then got some unfortunate news - my original Learners restrictions would apply again, and I would need to take the Motorcycle Skills Test after 30 days of my new Learners license, and only after that could I take the Road Test!
>  
> I expressed my concern, as the time is absolutely horrible - snow is melting, so everyone wants to go out riding again! He put me on hold to talk to his supervisor who reaffirmed the above.
>  
> This is not acceptable. If there are not enough time slots or people to do the Road Tests when people are available, then that needs to be fixed. If someone has taken and passed their Skills Test, that should be on the record and not have to be repeated if the only reason to renew is because there are no Road Test slots available. A Motorcycle Road Test should be the easiest with COVID, since we are naturally distant during the test. I spent all of last spring and summer practising, waiting for a slot to open, to the point of checking back daily for a couple weeks on end, to see no open spots.
>  
> I see a few solutions to the above problem, which would be a policy-based change:
> - Extend Learner's Licenses to 2 years for all licenses;
> - Extend Learner's License after the Skills Test to be 1 full year after the test;
> - If the MST was completed, don't remove the privilege of driving on my own if I renew my Learner's; or
> - Hire more driver examiners to administer the test in Northern BC.
>  
> I look forward to your response. If any of this is unclear, please feel free to call me on my cell phone at (250) 555-1234 or reply by email.

Hi all - you may remember our post -([https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/kyz4x8/hi\_fellow\_canadians\_we\_built\_a\_site\_that\_makes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/kyz4x8/hi_fellow_canadians_we_built_a_site_that_makes/)) from last week introducing you to our site - for those that didn’t catch it, covidinformer.ca is a site that simplifies the COVID-19 restrictions per-province, and also provides a dashboard to see the most recent news and stats for every province. 

Since we last spoke, we’ve received some great feedback (and help) from the community and, as a result, there’s been some hard work put in to respond to that feedback. This post is to announce some of the changes we’ve made, including:

* A fully translated French version! Simply use the “Globe” icon in the top right and the entire site has been translated to French - please let us know if you see any language errors as we are bilingual, but not native speakers. 
   * HUGE shoutout to /u/coffeetablebookabout for translating all the provinces’ restrictions - this was no easy feat and is definitely worth a shoutout!
* A rolling Weekly Average tracker: Some provinces don’t provide data on weekends as we quickly found out, so we’ve added a rolling average to that should give a better idea of the trend of cases - we noticed many news sources use this, and figure it would be valuable.
* We’ve also added disclaimers for the Daily statistics so that there’s no confusion
* There are many other changes under the hood to make our lives easier (for constant updates, feedback, translating, etc.) - while these aren’t visible changes, we think they’ll help Covid Informer serve you better!

As always, please feel free to reach out to offer feedback, corrections, suggestions, or even a helping hand - you can do this either here, on Twitter ([@CovidInformer](https://twitter.com/CovidInformer)), or via the Contact Form on the website!

Hoping everyone stays safe and sound!

As mentioned on the site, the primary purpose of the COVID Informer is to clearly translate and present what is and isn’t allowed as part of restrictions for COVID-19, ensuring that all of us are kept safe and following local guidelines. 

Since these restrictions vary by province and territory and continue to evolve on a weekly basis, we felt it was worth building a centralized hub that fellow Canadians in each province/territory could consult for the latest news and information, organized in a consistent and easy-to-understand format.

This was thrown together quite quickly in our spare time, so we’re very open to any and all feedback about any part of it - we sincerely hope this helps someone out, and please let us know if there’s anything you think we can improve, either here or via the Contact page!

For the moment, our next step is to fully translate the content into French, and then into more languages based on StatCan’s language survey.

1. How difficult is it to find a dog-friendly place to rent there? What's the price range like? I don't see many listings on Craigslist which is concerning.
2. Are welders and/or metal fabricators in demand on more than a temporary basis?
3. How difficult is it for newcomers to meet people and make friends with similar interests (I am into what I expect most people up there to be into - hiking, exploring, rockhounding, foraging etc.)?  I admit, I am also left-leaning and a bit of a true nature lover, ex. I am not fond of hunting, although I respect those who do it humanely. Are most people up there going to provide mutual respect towards that, or will they look down on those who don't feel the same?
4. Does it ever feel TOO isolated up there? How much of a hassle is it to travel outside of the country, or even just back to Vancouver?
5. How sketchy is it, really? I keep seeing Northern B.C. being brought up on the most dangerous places in Canada lists, year after year. I am a young female and would like to feel safe walking in my town at night alone. This being said, I understand these issues are endemic and most small places in Canada are being faced with them increasingly. How do the more healthy citizens of Northern B.C. feel towards this, are they working to help change it at all?
6. How many old growth forests are left up there with decently big trees? I know there is [some](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g671271-d10822372-Reviews-Giant_Spruce_Park-Kitimat_Kitimat_Stikine_District_British_Columbia.html) (or, at least potential for some), but it doesn't seem like too much that I can find online. I am not talking just easy access forests, but overall existing ones?

Half our group is in Vancouver and the other half is in Kelowna, so we are looking for a spot that is roughly halfway between the two. 

We don't mind a short hike (nothing over 2 hours, 1hour or less preferred, and not too strenuous elevation-wise). Vehicle-accessible campsites are fine too. We have done the Delacy campsite from Sumallo Grove before, and it was quite nice when the weather permitted. The biggest plus is how secluded and quiet it was - ours was the only group there. No campfire ban is also a plus. We would also prefer a campsite that is free from snow in a couple weeks, as once we went camping while the snow hadn't fully melted and it was not a fun time for us.

Two spots I am currently looking at are the recreation sites near Pike Mtn ([Goose Lake South and such](http://www.sitesandtrailsbc.ca/search/search-result.aspx?site=REC1791&type=Site)), as well as Falls Lake in Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area.

Madison Scott

Hogsback Lake, around 20 kilometers away from Vanderhoof BC, is a cozy camping area with a dock on the lake. It was a popular area for young people to have parties due to the camping areas and isolation. It is far enough away that the noise of a party wouldn't bother anyone living nearby who might call the RCMP and get the party shut down.

The weather on May 27, 2011, was crisp, near 10 degrees Celcius, when young Madison Scott went to a campsite party at Hogback Lake. Madison went with her friend Jordie with the intention of attending the party then camping overnight to avoid driving under the influence as there was alcohol at this get-together.

The party at Hogsback Lake was around 50 people, and according to reports, near the end of the night some people showed up that were not known to most people and the mood of the night soured. Around this time most people decided to leave rather than stay the night at the campground.

Hogsback Lake

What Happened to Maddy?

Maddy's friend Jordie decided to leave around 2:30 but could not convince her to come with her because she was already set up at her campsite. Maddy tried to get Jordie to stay with her but Jordie was extremely drunk and had fallen into a campfire and just wanted to go home. Maddy decided stayed to spend the night at her camp by herself.

The last time anyone reported seeing Madison was 2:45 to 3:00 in the morning when Jordie left the party.

The next day some people came to the campsite to clean up and noticed that Madison's tent was still there but did not check to see if she was inside. It is noted that Madison's truck was still parked in the same spot as it was the night before. Aside from Madison's tent, no one else was at the campsite. Madison is a bright, intelligent and independent young lady 20 years of age. There wasn't any evidence at this time to make anyone think something could have been wrong.

One major issue that is probably caused a problem finding any clues was that the next night after Madison and Jordie went to Hogsback Lake there was another party, one significantly larger with around 150 people attending. At this time that no one reported seeing Maddy at the larger party. If we assume that whatever happened to Maddy happened the night before, any evidence that could have been found was probably inadvertently destroyed by the partygoers at this larger party.

Maddy's parents were concerned that she had not come home or contacted them on the 28th, but she was an adult. If she decided to stay another night then it was her choice. Cell service in the area was spotty at best so she might not have been able to call and let them know that she was staying an extra night.

But by the 29th Madison's parents had a bad feeling and after being unable to contact her on her cell phone they decided to go to Hogsback Lake and look for her. Once at Hogsback Lake, they found Maddy's truck at her campsite with her purse still inside, but her tent had been flattened out, and some of her belongings were inside but had been pushed to the sides of the tent. After they found that Maddy was not at the campsite they contacted the RCMP and reported her missing.

For more info about this case visit http://madisonscott.ca/

This case has always interested me, how can there be 50 people one night and 150 the next and no one saw anything? I think this case can be solved. The right person just has to come forward.

I've been a class 7 driver for nearly 4 years with no record. Last week, I got my very first ticket for disobeying a sign (no right turn within specific timeframe (was my first time on this road and didn't see the sign - doesn't excuse what I did)). Based on what friends and Reddit threads have said, I should take my class 5 before paying the ticket so that I don't lose my licence. It's also only 2 demerit points so luckily it doesn't f up my insurance (which was my biggest concern). Fortunately, I got a spot for a class 5 road test tomorrow but I'm scared that if I show up to my test and they see I have an outstanding ticket they'll refuse to let me take the test. But I'm also scared that if I do pay for the ticket before my test, they'll see it in my records and won't let me take it because I'm supposed to have 2 years of clean driving before taking my class 5. What do I do?? Thanks for your help!

Ps: I've had conflicting info on whether I should dispute it or not. I'm leaning more towards no just because I have too much anxiety waiting 1 year to go to court only for a high likelihood the cop will show up, the judge will side w them, and I'll have to pay the ticket in full. I could say that it was an honest mistake (it truly was) and that I'm a student in hopes to lower the ticket fee but idk if it's worth the hassle (I'd only end up paying $50 if I pay tomorrow because it's $96 if I pay early and I'm splitting fee w my friend I carpooled w).

Update: Hi all. Just got back home from my class 5 test and passed! The examiner didn't ask me anything in regards to a ticket so I kept my mouth shut. Just as DriverTesterGuy said (and [this website](https://drivinginstructorblog.com/new-driver-speeding/)), as long as you haven't racked up enough demerit points to warrant a driving prohibition, you should be fine. I'm going to pay off the ticket in a few days after I receive my paycheque to have this whole ordeal over and done w as I don't think I have much of a foot to stand on and so why drag out the time and community resources? I will just treat this as a big lesson to be more vigilant of regulatory signs. Will update if it turns out my licence does get revoked after I pay the ticket (I don't think it'll happen though). But yea, this is just a cautionary tale for all the new drivers out there.

British Columbia’s (BC) new Pay Transparency Act (the Act) was passed on May 11, 2023, imposing limitations on employers in the hiring process, as well as obligations to report pay. The Act also creates the role of Director of Pay Transparency. The key obligations are as follows:

Pay history: Employers must not ask job applicants their previous pay rate;
Job postings: Employers must include the expected pay or pay range for publicly posted jobs from November 1, 2023, onwards;

Pay secrecy: Employers must not discipline or otherwise harass an employee who asks about their pay, reveals their pay to another employee or someone applying to work with their employer; asks their employer about its pay transparency report, or gives information to the Director of Pay Transparency about their employer; and
Pay transparency report: Applicable employers must complete and post pay transparency reports, which will be published annually on June 1 by the Ministry of Finance. Applicable employers currently include the government and specified Crown corporations; however, starting November 1, 2024, all employers with 1,000 or more employees will be required to comply. By 2027, all employers in BC will be required to complete and post pay transparency reports unless exempted by regulation.
British Columbia trails the path of most other provinces in imposing pay transparency obligations, many of which also have pay equity obligations requiring employers to not only disclose pay, but ensure that pay is equitable amongst similarly positioned employees. Alberta and Saskatchewan are the only provinces without any such legislation.

So what does this really mean for employers in British Columbia?

The Act does not currently set out penalties for noncompliant employers or oblige employers to disclose any inequities in pay. It also does not designate a particular body, such as the Employment Standards Branch, to investigate or discipline employers, so it is unclear what enforcement of the Act may look like. Currently, there are no enforcement mechanisms in the Act.

Despite the lack of enforcement provisions under the Act, there are existing pay equity protections for employees under section 12 of the Human Rights Code, which prohibits employers from discriminating in wages between similarly positioned employees on the basis of sex. This places the onus on employees to initiate a complaints process with the BC Human Rights Tribunal in order to address concerns with respect to wage discrimination.

Employers should comply with the new obligations under the Act and anticipate that noncompliance in pay inequities can be enforced under the human rights regime. Employers should take steps to confirm that they are compliant with pay transparency and pay equity requirements, along with best practices, as we anticipate this area will be subject to increased scrutiny in the coming years.",britishcolumbia,BC Pay Transparency Act,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/145kcd9/bc_pay_transparency_act/

Petition to the House of Commons in Parliament assembled

Whereas:

* Nudity is not intrinsically sexual, indecent, or obscene;
* The existing prohibition on public nudity harms society by reinforcing the notion that the human body is inherently shameful;
* Nudism is known to have significant benefits to physical and mental health;
* Non-sexual nudity is not harmful to children or youth;
* Clothing, and the process of washing it, is known to cause significant water pollution in the form of microfibres;
* The existing prohibition on public nudity is unduly Anglocentric for a nation composed of citizens of many ethnic origins who value and respect cultural and racial diversity; and
* Public nudity per se was not historically an offence at common law, nor under the Criminal Code until 1954.

We, the undersigned, **citizens and residents of Canada**, call upon the **House of Commons** to repeal Section 174 of the Criminal Code and insert language into the Criminal Code specifying that public nudity, in and of itself, is not indecent, obscene, or a nuisance.

I just moved here a couple months ago from Mexico. I used to be a resident of the State of Mexico.

Residents of the State of Mexico are eligible to apply for 2 driver licenses (One from the State of Mexico and one from Mexico City) I used to have both since a while ago Mexico City used to give out permanent driver's licenses (One that doesn't have an expiration date and is forever) so saving money on renewals was one of the main reasons why I got the Mexico City one.

I just moved to BC and I exchanged my State of Mexico driver's license for a BC one, however; that means I still had my Mexico City driver's license so I shipped it back to my parents in Mexico.

I know the ICBC website says it's illegal to have 2 driver's licenses so that's why I shipped back my CDMX DL back to Mexico, but I took a look at the [Highway Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/91consol15/91consol15/79167) and the [MOTOR VEHICLE ACT REGULATIONS](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/26_58_06) and I couldn't find exactly where it says it's illegal to have more than 1 driver license in BC.

When I looked up the Ontario Highway Act I found it almost immediately:

""A driver may not apply for, secure or retain in his or her possession more than one driver's licence,"" Section 35.1e of Ontario's Highway Traffic Act.

But even that one says it's okay as long as it's required by the law of another state or province and was issued in compliance with the law of that province, territory or state.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 35 (4).

My Mexico City driver's license was definitely issued in compliance with Mexican Law. So my question is, even though the ICBC website says it's illegal, I couldn't find it in the actual act. That being said I only tried to find it using CTRL + F so I might've missed it.

If there is actually no law prohibiting having more than 2 licenses (or it has a similar loophole where licenses are allowed if they were issued in compliance with the law) could I ask my parents to ship back my CDMX and drive with both driver's licenses and if I get pulled over I could present my Mexico City driver's license to avoid demerit points on my BC driver's license?

I know BC law requires you to exchange your license within 90 days of arriving here and I did that, I never lied in my application, I said I did have another driver's license, I surrendered my State of Mexico Driver's license to ICBC and shipped back my CDMX license back to Mexico.

I know it's not the most decent thing to do, I never been pulled over in my life (not even when I lived in Utah) and I'm hoping I can keep my good record even if I can't get back my CDMX DL.

If it is still illegal well, that's all she wrote. I was just curious, I believe I'm a good driver but the thought that I would never get demerit points in my BC DL was nice, but if it's illegal I won't do that obviously, don't want to get charged with a misdemeanor and a fine on top of the demerit points if I get back my CDMX DL.",britishcolumbia,Having 2 licenses in BC,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/uee7bx/having_2_licenses_in_bc/

BC is the only jurisdiction that will flat out say “No Pets” in over 90% of rental listings, and the ones that do allow pets are often priced 10-20% above market, if they can even be found at all.

Why is BC the only province that has such a hostility towards pet owners? Landlords in other provinces often ask for pet deposits and additional cleaning fees, which is more than reasonable, but they can’t refuse, or charge a tenant higher rent because they have a pet!

Why has this attitude been allowed to prevail here for so long, especially as more and more families are choosing to have pets?

EDIT: sounds like consensus is cost/damage, but my experience is that kids do more damage to units than dogs (as a former landlord). I can’t discriminate against parents (or even charge them more), so why pets? Is the solution higher deposits and legislation prohibiting pet bans? It’s not fair that pet owners are discriminated against in an already tough rental market. Yes owning a pet is a choice, but so is having children.

EDIT 2: There are far too many comments and I can’t respond to all of them but I want to address a few things/common themes…

1. I was a landlord in the past, and some of the comments from landlords reek of privilege and entitlement. It’s been a landlords market for almost 2 decades in this province and you complain about having to spend a few thousand bucks to replace a carpet or flooring after a pet owner moves out, all while the value of your property has gone up by hundreds of thousands of dollars and you’ll probably be able to rent for 20-30% more once said person moves out. To me, expenses like this are just the risk you take when you have a rental property (I recognized that), get over yourself. If you aren’t willing to take these risks, don’t be a landlord.

2. Not everyone has the luxury of being able to buy, stop telling people to just “buy a house” if you want to have a pet. I am buying a place because I want to have a dog. I don’t want to be a homeowner again but it’s the only way I can have a dog in this market because of entitled landlords. I recognize that my ability to buy is a privilege, and not everyone can do this.  

3. Not everyone can, or wants to, have children. People should be allowed to have less costly companions that help them with their mental health and give them a sense of purpose, in that respect they are the same, yes they are not humans but they are still part of people’s families. This is to all the people coming at me defending allowing kids, but not pets. Some people need to be applauded for recognizing that they shouldn’t have kids, and not be faulted for wanting something that gives them purpose and happiness.

4. It sounds like this is becoming more common in other tight rental markets too where landlords can be picky, the point I was trying to make in the original post was that in BC, a landlord can flat out say no pets, and you can be in violation of the lease and be evicted if you have pets later on. In other provinces, you can’t be evicted for obtaining pets after signing the lease. I don’t advocate for misleading your landlord, but I understand why some people might when they have no other options.

5. I do understand that pet damage can cost money, which is why I’m advocating for solutions. Why not things like pet references, higher deposits (obviously would need legislation), and insurance for pet owners? No one should have to choose between homelessness or giving up their pet if they are forced to move.",britishcolumbia,Why are BC landlords so hostile towards pet owners?,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/ub12ic/why_are_bc_landlords_so_hostile_towards_pet_owners/

But this is only going to create a bigger gap between say new hires at a company and the employees who’ve been with that same company for a couple of years.

 - Require all publicly advertised job postings to include a salary rate or range;
- Bar employers from asking a job candidate about their past compensation;
- Prohibit reprisals against employees who discuss or disclose compensation; and
 - Establish a reporting framework that will require employers with 100 or more employees to track, report and post compensation gaps based on gender and other diversity characteristics.
 
 
The above-referenced reporting requirements are as follows:

- Employers with 100 or more employees must collect prescribed information for the purposes of preparing a pay transparency report no later than May 15 each year;
- Employers with 250 or more employees must submit their first pay transparency report by no later than May 15, 2020;
- Employers with 100 to 249 employees must submit their first pay transparency report by no later than May 15, 2021.
- After these reports are submitted, they must be posted online or in a conspicuous location within the workplace.

Anyway, I'm not here to get into the politics of it.  The problem that I am facing is trying to figure out what kind of stove set up I can use that pleases the Crown.  I've looked at the rules, and all it says for fire bans is that you can use certain stoves if they are ""CSA/ULA"" approved.  But what does this even mean??  


For instance, we all grew up around those old Coleman cooking stoves.  I have one that uses liquid fuel (Coleman gas or whatever it is called), but I can't find CSA markings anywhere on it.  I'm looking at propane stoves, like Coleman cook stoves and even Mr. Buddy type heaters, but no mention of CSA/ULA certification anywhere.  The only stoves that are marketed as CSA-compliant are those little butane stoves, but those things won't last long when out in the woods for weeks at a time.

In a strata complex with no age restrictions, can the strata pass a rule prohibiting all children (including the children of owners/residents) from using the pool for much of the day?


We have been having an ongoing disagreement with our strata and are hoping someone can help point us in the right direction. My husband and I purchased our unit pre-sale in a development with a pool when we were a young couple. We knew that we would be starting a family eventually, so obviously we made sure to purchase in a development with no age restrictions. 


Several years ago a rule was passed prohibiting children from using the pool except during the hours of 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm. My husband and I were not pleased, but since we didn’t have children at the time we couldn’t exactly argue that the rule was unfair to us, so we kept quiet.


After our first child was born, we (as well as other owners with children) wrote to the strata several times asking that the rule be struck due to its unfairness. During a Q&A session that took place prior to the upcoming AGM, the strata president assured us that the rule would either be struck entirely, or amended to state that it applied only to children who were visiting, and not to those who resided in the complex.


Unfortunately - and to our shock - the strata went back on their word and when we received the AGM package we saw that our only option was to vote to keep the rule as is (with children only being allowed in the pool from 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm), or to amend it to now prohibit children from using the pool except from the hours of 10:00 am to 1:00 pm and after 4:00 pm. We were not even given the option of voting to have the rule struck.


Over the years more and more seniors have moved into the complex and now greatly outnumber the families here. While the majority of the seniors are lovely, there is a small group of “senior bullies” who do not feel that families with children should live here and do their best to make us feel unwelcome. Ironically, having purchased pre-sale, my husband and I have lived here for far longer than these new residents who feel that we should not be here. 


We never would have purchased in a complex that heavily restricted our (future) children from using the pool and don’t see how a rule that blatantly caters to one group of owners at the expense of another can even be enforceable, regardless of the fact that it was voted in by the childless majority. Sadly most of the other families with kids have since “taken the hint” and sold their homes and moved out, however we are on a budget and selling and moving do not come without considerable expense, and furthermore we (otherwise) like where we live and don’t feel like we should be bullied out of our home just because we had children.


Is this something that would be worth taking to the Civil Resolution Tribunal? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if the advice is that we need to just suck it up and deal with this rule because there is nothing we can do.

(I haven't seen him in like 6 or 7 years, as I've been out of the country. I've been through quarantine now, so I'm not carrying anything.)

But his landlord has taped a sign to the front door of the building saying:

> DUE TO THE COVID19 VIRUS CRISIS :  
> VISITORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER THIS BUILDING.....

> by ORDER of :  
> [company name] Property Management

However, I'm pretty suspicious that they don't actually have the legal right to do that.

With a quick google, I found only this:  
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/covid-19

> A landlord can reasonably restrict or schedule the use of common or shared areas to support physical distancing and prevent the spread of the virus. 

> - This applies to both tenants and guests of the rental building  
> - A landlord must not prevent or interfere with the access to the tenant's rental unit

> Landlords may reasonably restrict access to a shared service or facility such as a gym, pool or laundry room in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporary restrictions on access to common areas are considered reasonable if they are made:

> - to protect the health, safety or welfare of the landlord, the tenant, an occupant or a guest of the residential property due to the COVID-19 pandemic;  
> - to comply with an order of a federal, British Columbia, regional or municipal government authority, including orders made by the Provincial Health Officer or under the Emergency Program Act; or  
> - to follow the guidelines of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control or the Public Health Agency of Canada.

> Reasonable restrictions may include:

> - Closing access to gyms, recreation rooms, pools and hot tubs where physical distancing cannot be maintained at all times  
> - Limiting use of elevators to 2-3 passengers at a time  
> - Limiting the number of residents in laundry facilities at a time. Consider creating a laundry schedule for managing the number of residents in the room (landlords should make all reasonable efforts to allow tenants to have safe access to laundry rooms).

Which seems to clearly imply the assumption that the rules for guests continue to apply otherwise exactly the same as before covid19  
(ie, like this: http://tenants.bc.ca/guests/ )

ie, due to the Covid19 situation,  
a landlord can apply reasonable restrictions/scheduling to the use of common/shared areas of the building (laundry rooms etc),  
and those restrictions will apply equally to both tenants and their guests  
but a landlord can *not* restrict guests from visiting a tenant as they normally would.

ie, the landlord can not prohibit me from entering the building and visiting my friend in his apartment,  
(whether for a day visit, or even an overnight stay).

Is this correct?

And yeah, of course I'm going to ask this directly to the BC Gov contact too, but I just also wanted to ask on reddit if anybody else had already run into this situation already...

(Because yeah, from stories my friend has told me, it sounds like this landlord had already, long before Covid19, been... apparently not as familiar with their tenant's rights as they should be, shall we say.)",britishcolumbia,Can the landlord of an apartment legally prohibit guests from entering the building *at all* due to Covid?

He made a great first impression: he was friendly, knowledgeable, patiently explained various options, and his quote was very competitive. Nevertheless I went through the due diligence steps listed below and it’s a good thing I did: this guy is a long-time con man with a penchant for taking large cash deposits from unsuspecting clients then never finishing the work (assuming he ever started). Over the past 15 years, he’s been sued 10+ times in various locales in BC and has been convicted of 10+ offenses, including two counts of Mischief under $5000, three counts of Theft under $5000, Assault, Assault with a Weapon, many “Failures to Appear” and six counts of driving while prohibited. 

The humbling part for me was that my Spidey senses didn’t go off when dealing with him. At all. But given his legal history, it’s clear I’m not the only one who trusted him and lived to regret it. 

Let’s say you’re thinking of hiring a local contractor by the name of “Donald Trump” to build you a wall. Here’s some steps you can take to try to ferret out whether you’re dealing with a crook: 

1.	Make sure to get his first and last name. Not providing a surname may be an evasive maneuver to thwart legal proceedings and you’re going to need it for the steps below. 
2.	Obviously, run a Google search of the company name and/or the person’s name, to find customer reviews. 
3.	Ask for references.
4.	Check the Better Business Bureau for complaints. 
5.	Check to see if he’s been sued on CSO (Court Services Online). Go to [Court Services Online]( https://justice.gov.bc.ca/cso/index.do), and click on “Search Civil” to check for any civil proceedings associated with the name. 
6.	Check CSO to see if he’s been charged with any offences. Go to [Court Services Online]( https://justice.gov.bc.ca/cso/index.do), and click on “Search Traffic/Civil” to see if the name appears. The record will confirm what the person is charged with and if they were convicted or acquitted. 
7.	Go to the [BC Judgments website]( https://www.bccourts.ca/search_judgments.aspx?court=0) and enter his surname under “Case Name” and his first name under “Key Words”. While unlikely, you might find a written decision involving your would-be contractor acting less than angelic. 

A few closing comments. First, CSO only provides basic details for free. You’d have to pay for access to the files if you want specifics. Second, be careful about identifying the person: while searching for “Donald Trump” the search results may include a “Donald J Trump” as well as a “Donald A Trump.” You don’t want to find yourself falsely accusing anyone (note: CSO lists birthdates and full legal names to help with identification). Third, everyone is presumed innocent until they are found guilty or liable. Finally, I’m not saying that any person with a record is unworthy of being hired, only that taking the steps above might uncover, as I did, a truly bad actor.

The question is, with this being first offence and with 2 years of clean driving, what are the chances of an appeal being successful? Or would I be better off just donating the $100?

Today I have received 3 month driving prohibition from RoadSafetyBC for two reasons:

1. Lack of N sign (6 month ago)
2. Using smartphone (3 month ago)

While I completely acknowledge my fault for using phone, even though it was at the red light to decline call, I do not understand why I receive maximum possible penalty for my violations. I do not have any speeding/red light/what ever else tickets and paid both fines on time. I got N-sign ""fail-to-display"" ticket while I was driving my company's car made entirely out of fiberglass with no magnetic surface and no rear window. Place where I work does not accommodate any public transportation nearby, so driving prohibition just destroys my time and pace of life. One more thing confusing me is that people get same 90-day prohibition for several excessive speeding tickets that is really unsafe on the road. Where is that border between 1-3 day prohibition and 3 month prohibition? What about people caught impaired under alcohol or weed?

I would be happy to hear anything from people with same driving prohibition experience (criticism etc) and whether it is possible to do something with this situation. I would like to apply for the Decision of Prohibit Review, however application costs 100$, so I would like to know whether it would really help. Thank you for reading and replying to this post.
