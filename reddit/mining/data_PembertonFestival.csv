As we prepare for another amazing year of festivals, I made /r/pnwfestivals to try to have a consolidated music festival sub for the great PNW.

However, I like other festivities. I'm sure you do too.

So what that means is that Art, Film, Food, Beer, Performance (like Pacific Fire Gathering or whatever else) and Cultural festivals are all fair game.

Fairs are also fair game. City, State/Province or County, it's all good. 

Same with public Block Parties.

Share your local festivities with us!",PembertonFestival,Come to /r/pnwfestivals to learn about and share local festivals and festivities!,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/PembertonFestival/comments/5h0n9g/come_to_rpnwfestivals_to_learn_about_and_share/

I started with the previous post that [/u/Lakoustic](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lakoustic) made where the available artists were tracked leading into the initial lineup drop - [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PembertonFestival/comments/43ahcu/uptodate_list_of_who_is_touring_available_during/)

This is a work in progress, but I just threw this together today. Will add a few more each day, and try to track and update artists already in the list when they drop new dates. 

If you want to see someone added, or if you see a mistake, just comment and let me know.

sp_bc,,1459995337,,False,4dp26e,False,True,t3_4dp26e,46,False,/r/PembertonFestival/comments/4dp26e/further_lineup_speculation/,11,"http://imgur.com/5qJYa3P (The current lineup, for reference)

A lot of people are talking about the fourth headliner, so I'll address that first. I've organized the following artists in my opinion on the chance of them being added. 

1. Arcade Fire are at Wayhome the weekend after Pemby and are in Portugal the weekend before, though there was speculation that they had decided that Wayhome would be a Canadian exclusive this summer.
2. Kanye. We've all seen the speculation on here, the lining up of his date in Portland, and the most recent tease by Pemberton themselves on Facebook.
3. Radiohead have been mentioned all over, and could likely be the 4th headliner, though I struggle to believe that they would add a third alternative headliner. 


The depth is where I think this lineup will really evolve though. A lot of people either complained or rejoiced about the heavy amount of rap in the supporting slots of the festival. I'm not a rap fan so please correct an errors I make, but this is what I have gathered.

1. J. Cole and Wiz Khalifa seem to be close friends, so I understand them touring together. In addition, Wiz and Snoop have a tour that kicks off the week after Pemby, which I'm sure made them an easy package deal.
2. Tyler and Earl Sweatshirt are also obviously linked together, so it makes sense for them both to be here. 
3. The only rappers I wasn't able to associate with others on the bill were Ice Cube and Mac Miller, but it's inevitable that not everyone will be linked together at a festival. 

Now is where we refer to the lineup layout that I posted up at the top. This was from 6pm on April 6th. 

The second line of the poster has Snoop Dogg, Kaskade, Wiz Khalifa, Bassnectar, Ice Cube, and Halsey, a total of 6 artists. In the next line, FKA Twigs is in the same sized font, but was put in her own line entirely. If we do get a 4th headliner, that would leave (at this point) 7 supporting artists for 4 days of headliners. Due to this formatting, I think the third line with FKA Twigs could very likely see **5 more artists** be announced in the coming days and weeks. 

This is where my main point comes through. As it stands we have 3 rappers, 2 EDM Acts, 1 Alternate Act, and 1 R&B act. I believe that if my predictions are correct, we could likely see another rapper added, 2-3 more alternative/indie/rock artists added, and likely 1 more R&B or EDM act. To close my post, these are my most likely guesses for who would be added to our lineup. 



ALTERNATIVE/INDIE/ROCK:
1. Chris Cornell (No Vancouver tour date, in Oregon on Sunday the 17th)
2. Lord Huron (In Quebec City on the 8th and Winnipeg from the 7th-10th, no western dates)
3. Milky Chance (In Alaska on Thursday the 13th)

RAP:
1. Future (In Ottawa July 16th)
2. A$AP Rocky (Friends with Tyler, Panorama on July 24th)

R&B/EDM:
1. Flume (Osheaga at the end of July, no date conflicts, could do Canadian tour starting West)
2. Knife Party (Just played at Seasons but loves the area and is in Vegas on the 17th)

Being from Southern California we got tired of Coachella and wanted to visit you guys. It was so much fun and the view was beautiful. I really did enjoy your hospitality and amazing vibes.

A story I always tell about Pemby was how hard it was to buy weed at the festival. We were staying in whistler and had bought some in Vancouver but used all of it before the festival. We didn't want to ask around the Olympic Village so we would wait until we got to the festival. It was a constant issue to not be able to buy weed. It wasn't that we couldn't find any, it was because you people are so damn nice EVERYONE we asked would just give it to us. FOR FREE!! 

Me: hey man do you happen to have any extra weed to sell. 
Person: nah brotha just take this!
*Hands me the joint he just lit*
Me: oh thanks!
Person: yeah share it with your friends!
Me: okay! Thanks again! Hey do you have any more that I can buy? 
(At this point I'm clearly smoking and don't think I'm giving off narc vibes)
Person: nah man it's cool. Just find me! I'll hook you up!
Me: that's very nice but I don't feel right just taking it, seriously can I buy you a beer or something? Food? A shirt?
Person: it's cool man. Don't worry. If you see me just ask. Here's another joint! Happy Pemby! 
Me:.....okay.....thank you! 

This seriously happened every single day of the festival! Standing around listening to acts we would get handed a blunt and when we passed it back they would just wave us off and say we could keep it. The green hospitality was amazing. You guys are a great group of people and deserve better than what your festival is giving you. You have my sympathy and I'm sending out positive vibes that your lineup kicks major ass.
