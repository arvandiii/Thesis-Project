It was just over a year ago that I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/o4eaz4/hey_vancouver_i_work_for_the_nonprofit_harpers/) about the [inclusive playground](https://www.harpersplayground.org/playgrounds/marshall-park/) coming to Vancouver! Well I'm excited to share that it is currently [under construction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AtQZa4wFm5d_dwoaj21WvIkMnr7mPDve/view?usp=sharing) and is set to open in spring 2023!

A little history: The original playground that stood at Marshall Park was built over two decades ago and was determined through inspections to be at the end of its lifespan and unsafe and due to be replaced.

Harper's Playground was asked by the City of Vancouver to help them with their initiative to reimagine the cities playgrounds and bring our radically inclusive design principles to the next iterations. We also have designed the playground at Esther Short that is also under construction.

The Chelsea Anderson Memorial Play Station at Marshall Park will continue to honor Chelsea's memory in many ways and will be the biggest we have ever built comprising 53,143 square feet/1.22 acres. This park will be physically, emotionally, and socially inviting for *everyone*, not just those who experience a disability, and not just for kids.

It will have:

* a ginormous hill with seating at the top with 360 views; prime for rolling, jumping, sliding and playing. It will be connected by a bridge with custom mosaic art underneath and adjacent from a local indigenous artist.
* Adaptive equipment such as Washington's first **wheelchair swing**, an **integration carousel** (think a merry go round that a wheelchair user can access), an **elevated sand area**, and a wheelchair accessible **skatepark**.
* A 100% bonafide **fire engine** that will be revamped into a play structure that people can interact with and play on - it will feature the original levers and buttons too.
* More equipment like a **log fort**, **mobius climber** (think rock wall climbers), **swings**, **musical instruments**, winding paths, and more.
* **Lots and lots of nature**. Every park we do is nature-infused which means we utilize the existing tree canopy and we will be adding dozens of more trees, bioswales, and plantings.
* Custom **bronze art** of animals like turtles and beavers to delight players.
* And so much more. [Click here for some sample photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1953DhxVaXQne2pcoQZNAvZMN42N1F3jD?usp=sharing).

The goal of our parks are to invite as many different people in as possible to inspire vital communities where people can make deep connections with their neighbors. We envision a more inclusive world.

While the park at Esther Short will be funded by the city budget, the one at Marshall Park will be built from donations. $3.2 million of them in fact. I know that sounds like a lot of money. But I have to tell you, we are building something like you have never seen before. Right now we have $2.75 million raised. **We need to raise $450,000 before the end of the year** or we will have to either phase the project and add some of the features later on or not add them at all.

We are a small nonprofit with just three employees - it's amazing how much we've raised already! A lot of grant writing, events, and local support. We are trying to reach as many people as we can about the project. If you want to help, let me know! We are selling [bricks and pavers](https://www.harpersplayground.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hp-paver-form-1_4-fillable.pdf) that will go inside the park where you can have your personalized message immortalized. Please consider donating any amount and sharing the project with the people and families who you know will enjoy it. [Donate link here.](https://www.harpersplayground.org/playgrounds/marshall-park/)

Once we are done, this park will belong to you Vancouver. We don't retain any ownership. It will be a public park and we are looking to Vancouver residents to invest in it.

My next post will be next spring with an invitation for you to attend the ribbon cutting and grand opening! Thank you so much for your support!

P.S. On November 3rd, the [Burgerville next to Clark College](https://goo.gl/maps/BRCYU7wZRJkjjjBW9) is doing a promotional event for the park. 20% of all orders will go the project from 4-8pm. You just need to let them know that you are there for ""Harper's Playground"". We will be there too.

P.S.S. The following businesses in Vancouver have put out brick and paver form displays for the park. Please visit their business and support them! If your business wants a display, let me know!

News Release from Clark Co. WA Communications
Posted on FlashAlert: October 17th, 2022 4:44 PM

Vancouver, Wash. – The Clark County Fire Marshal’s Office is asking for the public’s help in identifying persons and a vehicle of interest in an ongoing fire investigation. 

The Fire Marshal’s office is asking the public to review the video and photo below to see if they recognize the people or vehicle. The video was taken Sunday, Oct. 9 at approximately 3:30 pm on a ridge near where the Nakia Creek fire is burning on Larch Mountain. 

“We are looking for what we believe is a white or light-colored Subaru vehicle,” said Assistant Fire Marshal Curtis Eavenson. “Based on witness statements, we also believe there were two men and two women connected with this vehicle.”

If anyone recognizes the vehicle or people depicted in the video or has any information regarding the ongoing wildfire investigation, they are urged to contact the county’s Fire Marshal Office at (564) 397-3320.

The Nakia Creek fire is located 9 miles northeast of Camas in the Yacolt Burn State Forest. More information on the fire including evacuation updates can be found online at http://cresa911.org/2022/10/11/nakia-creek-fire-updates/.

I'm just a citizen and not officially involved with Charter Amendment 10, but it's seeming like a lot of Clark County is unaware of what's on their ballot in November.  And I think it's really cool we get the opportunity to improve our democracy and vote for Ranked Choice Voting here.

If you don't know what Ranked Choice Voting is - here's a short video explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z2fRPRkWvY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z2fRPRkWvY)

I'll be honest, my ultimate goal is to see the demise of the two-party system in my lifetime, because well it's obviously a dumpster fire at this point.  Ranked Choice Voting is the best solution I currently see and it's not partisan.  It's about every voter having more choice - right, left, or anywhere else.  

The only reason to be against ranked choice voting that I can think of are:  
•if you want to have less choice in how you express your political preferences,   
•you want to maintain the obviously broken & corrupt two party chocolate or vanilla status quo

Reasons I like RCV as an electoral upgrade:

\#1  It disincentives divisive politics - the divide & conquer, throw dirt at the other side negative politics is ineffective in a ranked choice system, because candidates need to be desirable to the wider populace of voters to win.  You can't just be a small factions 1st choice, you need to also be a worthy 2nd or 3rd choice to everyone else.  This promotes more cooperative candidates who are willing to be pragmatic and work together.

\#2 It saves time and money.  Ranked Choice Voting combines a primary, a regular election, and a run-off election into one ballot.  Saves voter's time.  Save's resources for mailing and printing ballots.  Saves the cost of staffing vote counts.

\#3 It takes away common election worries of ""throwing your vote away"" or ""voting for the lesser evil"" or having more than two candidates having a ""spoiler effect"".  It also give 3rd party candidates a fair shot, allowing a truer expression of our political preferences be heard.  I'm so tired of having just two choices.

Note: I wish this ballot initiative applied to our statewide and national candidates (like in Maine and  Alaska), it's just for local candidates for now, but we have to start somewhere, and I'd prefer our local elections to be upgraded to increase familiarity so a more complete Ranked Choice Voting ballot measure can succeed next time.

Here's more info about what's on the ballot in Clark County, Seattle, and San Jaun County in Washington :  [https://fairvotewa.org/](https://fairvotewa.org/)

Once you really start to look into the requirements, it's pretty hard to argue against the idea that Joe Kent is a fascist.

>1.) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism
Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

His slogan is ""America First for Congress"". If you've seen any of his rallies, you know that the flag is everywhere.

>2.) Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights
Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.

""I will fight to use the tools of federal law enforcement to dismantle the Antifa terrorist organization."" -- There is no such thing. Anyone who has ever been to an Antifa meeting can tell you that. They are as disorganized as it gets. Increasing federal law enforcement simply means decreasing personal rights. When you hunt down a boogeyman that doesn't exist, innocent people get hurt.

""I will work to cut off federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood."" -- This simply means limiting people's access to important things like health screenings and contraceptives. While you and I probably disagree about this, I see healthcare as a human right and any limitation on it as a violation of my rights.

>3.) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause
The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.

Do I even need a quote here? The entire issues page is just a long list of CHINA AND IMMIGRANTS ARE SCARY!!! And, I even agree that we need to do things to fix those issues, but not in the ways that he wants.

Oh, yeah, also, ANTIFA being a terrorist organization again. So laughable.

""Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is our number one national security threat and is already at war with us.""

>4.) Supremacy of the Military
Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.

""Our nation must retain a modern and highly skilled military, poised to strike and deter our enemies around the world at a moment’s notice. I support modernizing our force to focus on our main threat, China. For the past two decades, we have focused on ground counter-terror and counter-insurgency operations. We must support a decisive pivot to fighting a modern nation in every warfare domain, especially cyber and information warfare.""

>5.) Rampant Sexism
The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.

""I will work to cut off federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood.""

>6.)Controlled Mass Media
Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.

Obviously, he's not going to mention this on his campaign website, but he has already been caught lying in an attempt to shape the news cycle: [here.](https://thedispatch.com/p/staff-disputes-fiery-allegations)

> 7.) Obsession with National Security
Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.

Once again, China and Antifa.

>8.) Religion and Government are Intertwined
Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.

""I am a pro-life Christian. "" -- Non-fascists don't feel the need to reassure their audience that they are one of them.

> 9.) Corporate Power is Protected
The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.

""I will work to lower [...] corporate federal income taxes...""

""We should deregulate health care...""

""The fishing industry has also been over-regulated by the federal government...""

""I will work to remove cumbersome rules from these industries responsibly...""

Ahh, yes, those pesky environmental and safety rules! We hate those!

>10.) Labor Power is Suppressed
Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .

De-regulation = weak unions. Period.

>11.) Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts
Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.

Again, no one is going to openly state this on their campaign website, but can you imagine this guy wanting to fund the arts?

>12.) Obsession with Crime and Punishment
Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

"" I will fight to use the tools of federal law enforcement to dismantle the Antifa terrorist organization.""

Again, these words should strike fear into your heart. There is no such thing as the Antifa terrorist organization. 

>13.) Rampant Cronyism and Corruption
Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

Again, no one mentions this on their campaign website, but this guy hired Byron Sanford. Even though he later fired him, if that doesn't scream cronyism, then I don't know what does. Much worse, he kept Matt Braynard instead of disavowing his white nationalist buddies.

>14.) Fraudulent Elections
Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

Do I really need to explain this to you? I have a feeling that I do, but that feeling is so depressing that I am fighting against it because I don't want to believe that it is true.

About a month ago a very nice animal control person informed us that we could not have a rooster. We're technically in the county, however we are apparently in a ""urban expansion boundary"" - and therefore Alan had to go.

This I didn't mind so much because, though he was nice, he was very persistent about the state of the sun for most of the days. It was mostly hard because my toddler was fond of him.

Meanwhile since we're technically in the county our neighbors fire enough fireworks to alter the position of the planet for about seven days straight around the fourth. Frankly it seems like a shitty double standard.

The county just approved an additional $15.5 million dollars through 2024 for homelessness solutions and Share leadership needs serious intervention and/or replacement before they squander more money. 

As a former employee of Share, I can attest to the fact that there is total absence of any training in mental health or anything necessary for working in this field. Untrained staff are left alone to work in shelters and are refused requests for enhanced security or more staff. There was no response from leadership when a Covid outbreak happened at Share House in January and the only support we received was from The Council for The Homeless. This is only a fraction of the problems I witnessed and I won’t go into a lot of detail here, but want to share a few things I’ve discovered.

Share received $3.5 million from Clark County for emergency rental assistance and only helped 783 households when the estimates were 2,500-3,500 households with the entire $5.5 million budget and they were dinged in the 2020 audit for overstating $286,000 of those funds. 

SBA data shows that $538,854 of $718,472 of their fully forgiven PPP loan went to payroll and $179,618 went to “rent”. All other similar nonprofits in the PNW put 100% of their PPPs into payroll so it is unclear what rent they paid and why when their regular $10 million funding wasn’t impacted at all during Covid. An email sent during the Share House outbreak, some of us sitting home with Covid, said that they had extinguished the “Hero Pay” funds and had to access additional funds from “a reserve” to pay us 50% of the original amount but only through the end of the month. I did not even receive most of this because I was recovering from Covid and they didn’t give “Hero Pay” to people home with Covid contracted in their program. 

According to figures in the 2019 and 2020 audits, “Program Services Salaries and Related Expenses” which would encompass frontline staff, received $480,592 more in 2020 than 2019 and “Management and General Salaries and Related Expenses” received $213,129 more in 2020 than 2019, a fraction of the number of frontline staff, most of whom worked from home during the pandemic, or when in the administrative office were under very strict visitor procedures and no contact with the community. They didn’t even provide us with proper Covid procedures or support, why would they give themselves raises? Lol 

I think people in the community are already quite aware that the people running Share are simply interested in money. Frontline staff seeing people die on the street and are at a high risk of exposure to Covid, HIV, Hep C, MRSA, lice and bed bugs in their programs are quite aware of this as well because you never see or hear from them, nor receive support if you encounter any of these issues. They don’t even have a grievance process and the culture of Share is that you don’t say anything or you will be fired. I contacted the city and county and wrote a letter to the board and I was terminated a week later. I knew that was going to happen so I am more than fine. All it means is now I can be even more vocal and make sure change happens before a staff ends up seriously injured or dead and so that unhoused folks are getting services they deserve. It does not cost millions to simply shelter and feed people. They have to start providing legitimate services that encompass mental health, homelessness case management and housing retention.",vancouverwa,"Share is so poorly ran, the city paid $176K just to get out of a contract with them after they refused professional advice on fixing their problems.

CCSO’s Review and Implementation of Washington State 2021 Police Reform Legislation – Sheriff Atkins

The Washington State Legislature has completed in April the most significant package of police reforms in our history of current law enforcement. A majority of these laws come into effect on Sunday, July 25, 2021. These new laws were not passed by a vote of the people, but by legislators who to varying degrees did not constructively collaborate with various law enforcement groups during the legislative process. I remain concerned that language in the new laws that appears reasonable on its face, and could make sense to the average person, is problematic for the Clark County Sheriff’s Office. In addition, these reforms create challenges for our governmental partners and for citizens in ways that we will have to mitigate the best that the law allows.

Our concern is that the new legislation will have some unintentional consequences that could put the public and police officers in jeopardy. I expect that people could see a reduced police response and extended investigations as a result. I expect that despite our best efforts to the contrary, Clark County could be on a trajectory now to see the same type of increased crime and violence that larger cities are experiencing – elsewhere in Washington, Oregon, and across the country. 

• The Legislature has made clear it’s intention to reduce police contacts and police presence and therefore reduce police use of force. This tactic will be successful, but it comes with a cost.

• The Legislature has created a new “duty to leave the scene” for law enforcement officers. In the absence of a crime or an imminent threat of death or substantial bodily harm, law enforcement officers have a duty to leave the scene. HB 1310

• As of July 25th, the legislature has changed long standing state laws, based upon common law throughout the country, on when and under what circumstances it is lawful to use force. The new laws prohibit the use of force in any circumstance otherwise – making such use of force unlawful. 

If a law enforcement officer puts hands on someone to restrain them even slightly, this is a “use of force”. Prior to this new law, an officer who was able to articulate reasonable suspicion of a crime was authorized by law to use “objectively reasonable” force (as established by federal law and the US Supreme Court) as necessary to detain the person until it could be determined if they had committed a crime. 

• From a practical standpoint, the former law gave deputies the authority to detain someone, and use force if necessary to temporarily detain them, based upon them matching the description of a criminal leaving the scene of a crime, at least until deputies could arrive and help determine if there had been a crime, and if it was probable that the person detained had committed that crime. 

o For example, as law enforcement responds to an armed robbery at a convenience store. A subject matching the description of the robbery suspect is seen running away as deputies are arriving. We no longer have the authority to physically stop and detain (if they resist) that individual under these new reforms. We now need enough information (probable cause to make an arrest) to detain the suspect using force (grabbing, holding, etc.) and stop him.
 
• As a result, the very basic aspects of how law enforcement conducts itself is changing, and a paradigm shift must take place in the process. This includes those in law enforcement, as well as those governmental and community service groups who partner with law enforcement, and those who receive the services provided by law enforcement. That is all changing, rapidly.

o The governmental and community service groups include 911 dispatchers, fire departments, emergency medical services, child protective services, adult protective services, community mental health advocates, and homeless outreach services among many others.

• Law enforcement, over time, has become the default for almost every “emergency problem” in our community. As I have often said, “If you’re not on fire or bleeding…it becomes a law enforcement problem.” This was neither sought after nor desired, and police response and jail booking became the default for dealing with a wide variety of behaviors that at their core were not crimes or criminal conduct. This particularly relates to people experiencing substance use issues, and mental crisis. RCW 71.05.455

• Those encounters routinely involved the potential of varying levels of use of force, either to get the person to leave a place of business where they were not wanted, or to get them into health services. It is now unlawful to use force on such a person for which there is not probable cause that they have committed a crime or are an “imminent threat” of causing death or substantial bodily harm to another.

• ""Imminent threat of serious physical injury or death"" means that, based on the totality of the circumstances, it is objectively reasonable to believe that a person has the present and apparent  ability, opportunity, and intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. 

• The new law does not allow for use of force for enforcing civil orders for taking persons into custody for their health or welfare, for example. 

o The terminology of “Use of force” is typically associated with lethal, or deadly force. Use of force can also be forcing someone onto a gurney to be transported to a hospital, mental health, or substance use treatment center.

o Forcing a runaway child into a patrol car to be returned home, or to a hospital, or other treatment center.

o These are examples where it is unlawful for law enforcement officers to use force.

• Law enforcement officers determined to have used force unlawfully can now be de-certified by the state, absent the involvement of their Police Chief or Sheriff.  

• If police officers have a duty to leave the scene, absent a crime, or imminent threat of death or substantial bodily injury – then police administrators, supervisors and dispatchers must seriously consider whether it is appropriate to send a police officer to such a call.  A police officer who remains on-scene of a call, absent a crime or threat of imminent death or substantial bodily injury, is violating the law and is subject to being decertified by the state.

• New laws establish criteria for mandatory and discretionary de-certification and suspension of peace officers (and corrections officers) for what we consider to be the potential of errors in judgement, and mistakes, as opposed to intentional bad faith acts, decisions, or intentional excessive use of force. 

• Several police agencies in the state that adopted policies regarding the new law, have already reported numerous incidents indicating an inability to provide services to those on drugs or in mental crisis, and reduced public safety, because of the new law.

• In some instances, police are being called back to a scene, perhaps repeatedly, for their not having had the lawful authority to resolve the situation the first time - delivering the person in crisis to treatment for example, because it’s unlawful to use force for such a purpose under the new law.

• This creates a drain on already limited resources. As an anti-law enforcement sentiment has swept the country, law enforcement officers are leaving the profession in unprecedented numbers, many of them retiring early, or just going and getting new jobs, often at the urging of their spouses or significant others. This has occurred with Clark County deputies.

• Our agency, like many across the country and the state, are at critically low staffing shortages already, and having difficulty recruiting new hires as it was. The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs recently distributed a report reflecting that Washington state is 51st out of 50 states (when you include Washington DC) in the staffing metric of officers-per-thousand residents. Clark County is the lowest in the state of Washington at .65 officer-per-thousand. 

• This staffing shortage may be further exacerbated by the new “Duty of Care” doctrine created with the policing reform laws. This creates a higher standard of avoiding the use of force, in part by requiring deputies to request back-up deputies in effort to minimize the need for use of force. This will likely result in more deputies attending to fewer calls. Doing so reduces further the number of available deputies to respond to other calls, while at the same time angering some in the community who will object to an increased number of deputies as a “show of force”.

Resulting changes to how the Clark County Sheriff’s Office operates:

• Call response: If there is no outward appearance of a crime, and no threat of “imminent” harm, supervisors/sergeants must consider the totality of circumstances prior to allowing units to respond. Calls which historically included a police response, but may not any longer include people in mental crisis, suicidal individuals, Involuntary Treatment Act/Mental Health Pickups, runaways, civil standbys, evictions, parenting plan transfers, assist fire/ems with resistant of struggling/resistive patients, etc. These are all examples where there is no crime, and typically no threat of “imminent harm of death or substantial bodily harm.” For example, RCW 71.05.455 states, “…law enforcement officers are not mental health professionals. It is the intent of the legislature that mental health incidents are addressed by mental health professionals.” The Legislature’s intent is very clear. They do not want law enforcement officers present at non-criminal events.

o For example, a person in mental crisis, shouting on a street corner, even if openly waving a stick at the air is not committing a crime. They do not represent a threat of “imminent” harm of death of substantial bodily injury, in the legal sense as defined by the law.

• Sergeants will need to continuously evaluate what their deputies should/should not respond to, if the matter is not criminal, and there is no threat of imminent harm, the new law requires the deputy to leave the scene. 
• This significantly impacts “community caretaking” efforts that our deputies have engaged in for decades. We will work diligently at identifying alternate resources for people calling for assistance in such circumstances, trying to steer them to help where it may be otherwise available.

• We will also look to handle more calls by phone, which means people will not see deputies responding in person as often as they may be accustom.

Clark County Sheriff’s deputies have a long history of routinely and repeatedly putting their lives on the line, literally running into buildings, business, or other places upon hearing gunshots, or believing that a husband is trying to kill his wife, or that an armed murder suspect is hiding inside. We have a long history of protecting and safeguarding ALL of our community members in this way, regardless of race, gender, sexual preference or any other characteristic. We have and do risk our lives for the community, much more frequently than what most people can imagine.

Law Enforcement is still a NOBLE profession. Detractors have painted the industry with a very broad brush, seeking to vilify each and every police officer/deputy – regardless of individual gender, race, honesty, integrity, courage, heroism or decades of commendable service. We recognize most of our citizens still support us and how we serve them. Our MISSION has not changed – “to protect and safeguard the community.” We will continue to perform our duties with pride, courage, and diligence; free of bias or discrimination – but our operational procedures MUST change – as dictated by the legislature. We will continue to adjust our operational procedures in the weeks and months to come as we gain greater insight and understanding into the expectations of us from our community, the Courts, the Legislature, and our governmental business partners.",vancouverwa,Clark County Sheriff Department,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/oq5n6k/clark_county_sheriff_department/

I know there are people who see it as their “god-given rights as patriots” to set off fireworks, and if they’re told not to do something, that makes them want to do it more just to “stick it to the libs” and such.  Believe me, I know it IS fun to set off fireworks and make things go BOOM.  I grew up taking chunks out of concrete with M1000’s (aka, federal felony because those things aren’t legal without licenses and such), and my dad taught me how to smuggle fireworks that go kaboom in the sky to places where even sparklers aren’t legal, then how to go about not getting caught.  It’s fun.  A lot of fun.  In my heart, I was meant to be a pyrotechnician because this stuff IS FUN.  No one is denying this.

I’m not going to argue “think of the veterans,” or “think of the dogs that get scared” (I have seven animals, and the deaf one is the one who isn’t scared), or “think of the people who will blow their hands off or their eyes out” (if people want to get drunk and blow their body parts off, which I found out lat year when I was in the ER with an infection happens more often than you think, then do it and I’m gonna laugh at the drunk idiots who thought the best place to watch fireworks was when they were holding it and aiming if at their own faces).

In a typical year, there are risks, but this year, it’s too dry.  Remember what that one idiot did with that one firework?  The Eagle Creek fire?  And that wasn’t even one that lets off tons of sparks, just a small firework.  You may say you’ll just wet your yard and the roof of your house, but what about the yards of your neighbors and their houses, and this water shortage we’ve got going on?  No matter how responsible you try to be when lighting them, accidents happen.  That’s why it’s called an accident.  It’s negligence when you aren’t taking precautions, accidents when you do, and accidents happen even to the best of people, and the chance this years is just too high.  This year, all of it will be negligence since the chance of it going wrong are too high.  I know that a temporary law banning these things reads as a challenge to do it anyway, but we only have these temporary laws because of how many people can’t be trusted to act as adults, look at the situation in front of us, and make the mature, proper choice when that mature choice may involve having to back off of doing something you really want to do.  Children are the ones we expect to disregard safety and do something just because it is fun.  We need to be adults and have respect for how incredibly dry it is this year instead of arguing “but mah riiiiights, but mah freeeeedooooo.”

No, freedom doesn’t mean you get to do anything you want.  Freedom necessarily has limits.  The “freedom” this country gained wasn’t because of King George implementing unfair laws on colonists.  It was freedom from having to pay their share of some wars that gained more land that benefited the colonists, and paying the debts of those wars was draining the people still in England.  That’s what the stamp tax was about.  The colonists didn’t want to pay any part of the war they supported and benefited from.  It wasn’t about the freedom to set off fireworks, the freedom to not be owned if you were the “wrong” skin color, the freedom to end pregnancies, the freedom to impose Christianity on everyone else since no one else gets religious freedom, the freedom to smoke blunts, the freedom to own so many guns without regulations that you’re clearly compensating for something, the freedom to seek education, or anything aside from literally just freedom from justified debt and then sticking it to Georgie for having the audacity to want war debts paid.  So we can’t even sit here arguing that fireworks are a sign of freedom.  The founding fathers really didn’t care about that stuff at all.  They were actually kinda dicks.  Kinda funny that we celebrate them so much when they really don’t represent what either of the major political parties like to believe.  

So don’t try claiming fireworks are about freedom either since they’re not.

Fireworks don’t represent freedom.  And this isn’t a freedom issue this year anyway.  It’s an issue of trying to get people to open their eyes and realize that we are extremely dry and don’t have enough water.  Let’s not be like California and burn our state up, okay?  (I am from California, and really don’t want to see the PNW become like the place I left, and it’s unsettling to me how much this area is becoming like California.  Save your fireworks for New Year’s Eve, when we’re less likely to be so incredibly dry.  Go bananas then, when you aren’t so likely to set a house on fire.  Carefully grill, have a bunch of kombucha or Coors or cheap wine from a box, and enjoy the American pasttime of complaining about how unfair life is and how you can’t really enjoy time with your friends since they suck too much to be fun the 363 days a year when you aren’t lighting things on fire (July 4th and New Year’s Eve).  It’s cathartic.  And then, come New Year’s Eve?  Let it be game on with everything you’re saving from this month.  Go hog wild when the world is wet.  Delay now and blow up more shit then.",vancouverwa,"Don’t be like California because fires suck—Here’s why you should lay off the fireworks this one year, and it’s not about veterans or dogs",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/odc1ny/dont_be_like_california_because_fires_suckheres/

The current playground at Marshall Park next to the Luepke Community Center has most likely created many memories for you and your family. It was built in memory of 3-year old Chelsea Anderson, daughter of the then Vancouver Fire Chief, many years ago. The playground has reached the end of it's lifetime and needs to be replaced. The City of Vancouver has created Project Play with the intentions of bringing inclusive playgrounds to the neighborhoods in Vancouver. Harper's Playground is helping by providing design consultation but we are also 100% responsible for the funding for this particular playground-none of your tax money is going to it! =). We are going to honor the memory of Chelsea by keeping the fire engine theme. We actually even have a local artist that is working on creating a real fire engine play/art structure! The playground will be inclusive and accessible which means that everyone can get to everything by using smooth surfaces and pathways. There will also be a wheel play zone aka inclusive skate park and play equipment that wheelchair users can utilize, some of which have not been implemented in a playground yet aka we'll be the first!

I wanted to share because this will be huge for Vancouver! This summer we are going to be out and about at the Farmer's Market and participating in local events to raise awareness for the playground! So stop by and say hi and ask us questions! 

P.S. I know one of the group's rules is no advertising so I hope this okay! We really wanted to let the community know it's coming! Admins, if this is not okay, let me know or let me know what I'd need to change so that we can share!

Your moderation team has had [these Subreddit Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/wiki/rules) for a while, and one of the big ones is fundamentally ""Be good to one another"". We are a moderated public forum. We do not condone breaking the law nor do we allow posts which flirt with or encourage such behavior. We will continue to remove and even ban users who do so. A recent and important example are posts and users calling the pandemic a ""hoax"" and to break quarantine or spread it as far as possible.

People are in a state of worry or even panic right now (for reasons you do not get to judge) and our subreddit will not be used as a place to spread lies and deceit. We have been working to collate what verified local information we can and point people to higher level (state, federal, international) sources as well. You can find more of this information in the mod comment below.

In light of the state of emergency, we are also taking stricter and more rapid escalation on our removal/temp-ban/ban policies. Egregious offenders at this point in time can expect to be perma-banned. This is a time where users arguing in bad-faith, attempting to skirt rules, and posting unfounded rumors could cause real damage to peoples’ lives and livelihoods. Those behaviors were not welcome before but now we will be removing not just the behavior but the redditor as well.

This subreddit, and many more were created to help people; through laughter, community events, news, and various other actions that bring the people of Vancouver, WA together. Again, we are not in the business of mud slinging and do not support or condone such behavior.

---

PS: We will be canceling/aborting our subreddit plans for April Fools thing this year to not throw more flammables on the current fires/stress people are living by. We will probably revisit the plan and do it as a surprise some random 1st of a different month (or even do it next year instead, TBD).  In lieu of such an event, we are currently adding special flair to redditors as we see fit.

I was out doing errands around that time and was surprised to see a chopper flying really low and circling tightly around and area where there was a fair amount of smoke. I couldn't see any flames, but from the look of the smoke, it appeared widely spread, which I'm assuming was a brush/grass fire.  
When I returned to my work, I shot this video. We're sort of close to WSU's back entrance and the helicopter flew directly over our offices for nearly an hour. It was pretty dramatic.

Comment below with a story of something old you’ve found. Doesn’t matter what, doesn’t matter where.**

Any archaeologist worth their mettle is a storyteller by nature. It starts with the hearing of riveting fireside tales as a child: castles, hunters, explorers, shipwrecks – imaginings of a time when life was different. Tales of a more swashbuckling time when a dearer price was paid for prosperity…and survival. Back when humans were more tuned in to the landscape than to their laptops. Back when our highest forms of technology were fire, stone, and our own hands.

Or maybe I’m just projecting myself on other archaeologists. Maybe in reality most of us actually got into the field just because we didn’t want to take math classes in college. 

Either way, as archaeologists, our purpose in this life is to tell the story of humanity through the things humans left behind. Unlike written or oral history, without us, many of these stories would not otherwise be told.  And I believe that in the end this is how it boils down: good stories are likely to affect more people than a scientific paper which doesn’t draw any connections with actual people…[like this for example]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440397902557).

Don’t get me wrong though. Without an infusion of careful, logical, objective, modern science, archaeology would be just guesswork. It would be no different than the whimsical, and often highly destructive, [antiquarianism which predated archaeology]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquarian), or the extensive and illegal looting and collecting which [acts to destroy the material human record around the world]( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160216-ted-prize-sarah-parcak-satellite-archaeology/). Good science and good interpretation ultimately become the foundations for good stories. 

I could tell a story or two from my experiences doing archaeology in the Pacific Northwest: maybe about the strange old man who rambled on for 45 minutes about the evils of Oregonians while I was doing a shovel survey in Vancouver WA; or about the time I led a group of archaeology students in a mock recording of a site comprised entirely of pink underwear, cigar wrappers, and a mystery object that could only be described as a sasquatch egg; or about the time the electric fence in the Columbia River valley decided to touch me in the last spot a person would want to be touched by an electric fence.

Or I could piece together a story from the things I’ve found: perhaps I could describe how a small group of Chinookan hunter-gatherers discarded their spent hearth-rocks along the lake margins of Sauvie Island 750 years ago after roasting a meal of camas bulbs and sturgeon – probably enjoying the sight of the dramatic steam the hot rocks gave off. Or maybe I could spin a tale about the group of Clatsop people who made a small fire to process shellfish they gathered on a blustery rock promontory overlooking the surf near Ecola State Park. Or about the Kalapuya group who gathered at the height of winter to collect steelhead from a small river in Polk County, and who wore out a walking trail down to a nearby feeder creek – a trail that still survives to this day, thanks to the small buffer of native landscape the logging company left along the creek.

But I’d rather hear your story. **Comment below with a story about something archaeological that you’ve seen or discovered, some old piece of human history that was striking to you. I’d love to hear it.**

*Archaeology is a sub-discipline of anthropology. Archaeologists study the traces people leave behind – namely artifacts, features, structures, and impacts on the landscape. As in the rest of the United States, professional archaeological work occurs frequently in NW Oregon and SW Washington, and is carried out by universities, private companies, government agencies, and tribes. Archaeology is everywhere – in city, suburb, and wilderness alike.* 

*While archaeological work is largely funded by your public tax dollars, chances are you don’t realize that archaeology is being done regularly in your area. You are also likely unaware of the kinds of things archaeologists discover, explore, and analyze – despite the fact that these findings could have significant meaning and impact for you and many others. The difference a little solid knowledge of the past can make is amazing.* 

*This series of posts from professional archaeologists is meant to foster discussion about regional archaeological projects, topics, or issues, with the ultimate goal being a more informed and engaged public. Please join the conversation and let us know your thoughts. Do you have suggestions for next post’s topic?*

*PS: If these posts and discussions interest you, join us at the [6th annual Archaeology Roadshow in Portland on June 3rd]( https://www.pdx.edu/anthropology/archaeology-roadshow) and come ready to learn, share, and continue the conversation! This FREE event is Oregon’s largest ongoing archaeology/history outreach event, and includes educational exhibits and activities (for adults & kids alike) from dozens of local companies, agencies, and tribes, as well as a panel of experts to tell you more about any old objects you might have found (bring ‘em on in)!*

I want to tell you all about a really great free archaeology event in downtown Portland: Portland State University's Fifth Annual Archaeology Roadshow.
 
When: Saturday June 4th, 10 AM - 3 PM.

Where: Hoffman Hall; Portland State University Campus, 1833 SW 11th Ave -- 1 Block from the Portland Farmer's Market!

What: Large archaeology outreach event involving 100's of different community partners including local tribes, state and federal agencies, CRM firms, non-profits, students, and educators. There will be dozens of great educational exhibits, many of which are interactive and hands-on. Great for kids and adults alike!

Also, there will be a panel of experts that can look at any old rocks or artifacts you have found and tell you more about them! If in doubt, bring it in.

Oh, and free samples of historic beer! And you can throw an atlatl! And learn how to make fire without a match!

This year’s theme, “Archaeology of Dwellings,” is designed to get visitors thinking about the universal importance of home, and the diversity of structures and places that fill that need. From the remains of semi-subterranean pit houses to historic Portland bungalows, these resources have stories to tell about the people who built and lived in them.

There are some more links below - in particular the Youtube video will give you a good sense of what the event is like. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, and hope to see  you out there!

Looks hopeful that we will have a nice day though!



**The Plan**

The general consensus from [the RFC thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/255kng/preparing_our_slice_of_pie_for_global_reddit/)  was meeting at a park, potluck/bring food/group picnic, general gaming (board games to athletics), and after that heading to a bar. So here is the break down of what is needed and currently planned:


* Potluck: Due to us starting planning too late we could not reserve the covered area at Haagen park. (The current people reserved it almost a year ago!) So we will be setting up our own little area with tables and chairs and such. Due to safety and sanity please no fire-risk food preparations on site (eg, no on site grill, don't bring one).
    * Food! what kind of food can/are people bringing? Below here is the list of what people are currently bringing! 
        * /u/admalledd: biscuits and gravy
    * Supplies! what non-edibles to help out are people bringing?
        * /u/admalledd and /u/parkman47: At least two tables and a few chairs
* Gaming: /u/parkman47 and I (/u/admalledd) plan on bringing a few tables for the food allowing us to set up a little bit.
    * For those interested /u/parkman47 and I (/u/admalledd) will bring a few board games, trying to make them small and easy things to pick up thats not the standard fare (no monopoly etc...). Feel free to bring your own as well if you want! Just keep in mind the possible wind we get sometimes...
    * Hopefully some other people can bring things like a Frisbee or such for those who prefer those instead. Keep in mind that we would much rather prefer the style of play of ""group of friends playing"" rather than ""FOLLOW THE RULES, SUPER SERIOUS!""
* Bar: This I think (and a few others agree so far from PMs) that it should be decided at the meetup depending on where people prefer. 
    * General Idea is that around the time the park meetup is winding down (4-5 pm ish?) this group would pack up and head out. 
    * Although meeting at a bar was kinda high voted, many minors also expressed the desire to be able to go to the meetup.

I was wondering if anybody would be willing to allow me to park in their driveway or in front of their home tomorrow evening (5/2) to sleep and not call the cops on me.

I will be gone by 8 am and you don't even have to talk to me. I can't repay you in money right now, but if you want I'll give you some homemade Taiwanese chicken rolls, and I'll pay you 50$ next month.

A little bit of backstory, I find myself awkwardly housing insecure despite having a job(later this month) and an apartment(the day after tomorrow). 

I am a recent transplant to the area and there was a slight miscommunication with my workplace in terms of who would be footing the bill for my hotel during my relocation and as a result, I unexpectedly found out it was me who was supposed to foot the bill.

Considering, the fact I have to pay rent this month for a new apartment(and have to eat) I'm entirely reliant on my savings which I did not calculate for spending an extra few nights in a hotel. Thankfully, my landowner was willing to let me move in a few days earlier but tomorrow night I am still SOL for a place to sleep and I would appreciate it if someone would lend me their space to place my car to camp out for a single night. 

I don't feel comfortable going to a shelter considering I have literally all my belongings in my car at the moment and I am also unsure if I would be accepted for safe parking considering I have a job, ""technically"" own housing, and also money in my bank account(which I can't currently use on a hotel)

I am a college-educated woman who just needs a place to bum for 9-12 hour during the night. I don't do drugs, I don't drink or smoke, and at most I might leave to go to a gas station to use the restroom and that's it. I will really just sit there for the night, maybe sleep a bit, and then leave in the morning(which is when I can move into my new apartment).

I know this is a really weird request, but it would help me a lot if someone could make it possible.

Pls dm me if you want to get in contact.

Edit: I have a place to sleep thank you so much everyone it makes me feel better knowing the community I chose has people like you.",vancouverwa,"Weird request, would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me.",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/135b0ed/weird_request_would_greatly_appreciate_it_if/

The time of year when everyone is planning family dinners, buying gifts, and preparing for the holiday season!  

It's also the time of year when folks who don't have family, can start to feel extra alone. 

I used to feel ""unworthy"" of holidays. If your childhood experiences with the holidays are less than ""traditional""; seeing the ""normalcy"" of everyone else celebrating can make us feel like weirdos or imposters. 

Sometimes the memories of traumatic holidays just make us want to avoid the whole spectacle, so we can avoid the pain of bad memories and everything we never really got to experience. 

But if you'll let me... I'd love the chance to help create some happy holiday memories, to balance out the less than happy ones. 

So, if you're in need of a surrogate family for the holidays, or if you just don't want to be alone; please send me a message. I'll pick you up, I'll take you home, I'll fill your belly, and send you home with all the leftovers you can eat! This goes for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas.

If you're worried about awkwardness; don't be! I don't have a lot of family either! The family who will be here, is my own family that I've made, not anyone I was raised with. We aren't fancy! It will be a laid back event, there will be lots of food and laughs! There will be tons of mom hugs if you need them, or if you're not a person who likes to be touched; there will be ample personal space, and plenty of curious people who will treat you like family because that's how we treat everyone. 

We don't drink but a few folks smoke/vape weed in a space separate from the food area. We can put that away if you're not a fan, or if you're in recovery!

We have 2 children under 2 so children will of course be welcome! 

We have two cats, Puppy and Buddy. They are both ragdoll brothers from the same litter. They are both super friendly but we can keep them in another room if you're allergic or just not a fan of cats! 

If you don't want to be alone, you don't have to be. You're wanted here, where I am!

I forgot to mention that we (everyone who will be here) are all vaccinated.

If the response is large enough, I will look into renting a space out somewhere so that it's not limited to the size of our place. ",vancouverwa,Anyone looking for a surrogate family in / around Vancouver for the holidays?,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/qfx4jx/anyone_looking_for_a_surrogate_family_in_around/

# Professional Opinions:

[Cliff Mass](https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/) - focuses a bit on Seattle but generally talks about WA and OR as a whole.  Probably the professional opinion I trust the most.

[WA Smoke Blog](https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/) - articles and forecasts specific to WA state

[OR Smoke Blog](http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/) - articles and forecasts specific to OR state

# Current Air Quality

[AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/) - AirNow is the US official Air Quality Index.

[WA Dept of Ecology](https://enviwa.ecology.wa.gov/home/map) - WA state specific Air Quality, best to filter by PM2.5 instead of overall air quality

# Forecasts

From my research, there are two values for smoke forecasts.  The vertical smoke forecasts looks at the general smoke concentration from the ground to the upper atmosphere.  Then there is the near surface forecasts that looks at the air quality near the ground.

My research shows that the further out you look into the forecast, the less reliable it is.  Also, the forecast of where the boundaries of dense smoke is not very accurate.  That being said, the dense smoke has a pretty clear boundary in real time.  I drove from Vancouver to Idaho on Friday, and the boundary between dense smoke and clear air was about 1-2 miles.

[WA Department of Ecology Smoke Forecast](https://enviwa.ecology.wa.gov/home/text/421#Forecast) - Shows region by region.  Up to 24 hours.

[NOAA HRRR Smoke Forecast](https://hwp-viz.gsd.esrl.noaa.gov/smoke/index.html) - Takes a while to load the animation, shows up to 24-48 hours.

[El Dorodo Weather](https://www.eldoradoweather.com/forecast/smoke/pacnorthwest-smoke.html) - sources information from multiple agencies.  This particular link shows only the vertical integrated smoke for the PNW.

I'm more of the nature, bonfires, movie/music at home, relaxing with something low-key type. I don't like loud venues, such as bars or clubs. A nice board game or hike is fun though.

There is basically nothing for people on SSI. We don’t have enough vouchers. The waitlists are by and large closed up for super low income. Please fix. We aint asking for free housing. We are asking for a roof over our heads we pay for. 

Max single makes $914 and a couple makes $1,371. 

40% of our income is low enough…. I have been in too many situations where I paid more than I made now…. 

A studio for a married couple is good enough for me (i am in a married on SSI situation). As long as I don’t need to worry about roommates it is an improvement. But even with a roommate housing has been unaffordable for years even in supposed “affordable housing”. And I mean that in a negative multiple hundreds of dollars sense. Not in a simply tapped out sense. 

SSI has a lot of restrictions simply low income people do not have. All income under a roof can count against you if it isn’t separate enough. If we share a room, then we count as a household usually. We cannot take in-kind assistance for example. There are people who do not have family like I have family. But family help counts against my income too. My mother in law is on a breathing machine at night and my dad had a heart attack last year. My family could be gone someday very soon. For most people this can be devastating enough, but for us, its much more than that. It would mean a loss of housing. Possibly permanently with how Vancouver is set up rn. 

And think… people like this take up free shelter that could go to someone with no income at all. We have reliable income… we just can’t get more… and have a host of restrictions on roommates that means infinity roommates impossible….

MGP voted to green light coal, oil and gas projects, while dismantling parts of the Inflation Reduction Act…. I’m really shocked MGP would vote this way.

——————

EDITED TO ADD, as a lot of people seemed to think I’m an uninformed liberal without any nuance or knowledge of energy policy… ultimately, I believe her vote is inconsistent with her actual beliefs.

I spoke with MGP directly at an event tonight about it. Here’s my thoughts and how I respond to her (half hearted) support of this bill. 

TLDR: most people in this thread are wrong and she seems to mainly care about the “permitting reform” aspect of this bill and her stated hope is that that part will survive the senate anyways. 

Here are some more detailed thoughts: 

Supporters of H.R. 1 contend that the bill aims to lower energy prices, but some very key provisions related to crude oil and methane gas (LNG) exports will actually continue to raise energy costs for Americans. The oil and gas industry has targeted the Gulf South (Texas and Louisiana) to construct several new export terminal projects that would ramp up and lock in LNG and crude oil exports for many decades. Increased exports of domestic energy would restrict local supply and increase the price of fossil energy. Americans cannot afford further energy price hikes, and H.R. 1’s provisions that promote the expansion of energy exports would do just that for gasoline, diesel, and monthly home gas bills.

Oil industry lobbyists contend that more LNG exports will support our allies in Europe, however, what they don’t mention is that 1) many European allies are working very hard to move away from fossil fuels entirely and 2) that most of the industry’s new construction proposals (which would be greenlit by H.R. 1) would not be built or operational for at least two or more years. Thus, H.R. 1 would not help our allies. These new facilities will not be ready in time to significantly impact European energy supply. Talking points promoting increased LNG and oil exports are being pushed by industry lobbyists who want to lock in more profits by moving more American energy overseas.

There are important ways that we can reduce energy costs for Americans and I would love to see MGP support them. One Senate Bill, the Big Oil Windfall Profits Tax (https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Big%20Oil%20Windfall%20Profits%20Tax%20Act.pdf) targets the obscene profits that the oil and gas industry has raked in on the backs of hard working Americans.

Another tool would be to impose restrictions on energy exports during price surges. Many environmental and consumer advocates have been pushing for restrictions on exports to lower prices. Here is a multi-part series that covers how Texas LNG exports contributed to the massive statewide blackout in February 2021 and subsequent energy price gouging that Texas residents are still shouldering. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/while-texas-froze-part-1-major-miscalculation-texans-paul-robbins

MGP’s support on H.R. 1 is not wholehearted support – she mentioned to me that she doesn’t agree with many things in the bill, and that her primary intention behind voting for it would be to advance “Permitting Reform”, which she believes is needed to avoid negative impacts on clean energy projects. I understand the position and see how supporting this bill she doesn’t fully agree with is part of a reasonable political strategy to advance it to the Senate chamber where the bad provisions can be stripped and passed back to the House.

However, by making bold changes to permitting laws as this bill outlines, especially environmental regulation, we would likely deal with unintended consequences, like paving the way for truly destructive and detrimental polluting projects to disproportionately poor and working communities. In fact, the argument that permitting reform is a major obstacle to green energy projects is a little overblown. Experts on this issue have found the antidote to our environmental permitting laws is fixing how they are administered, not getting rid of or weakening them (https://www.vice.com/en/article/93a39e/why-doesnt-america-build-things). The unintended negative consequences would far outweigh the benefits for moving green projects sooner. In some cases, laws like NEPA are the only defense standing in the way of a massive polluting project or toxic pipeline that could devastate a local fishery or ecosystem.

Overall, I think H.R. 1 is not worth hanging her hat on and isn’t actually in line with her beliefs, but she may not be informed enough to even know that. Even the permitting reform angle doesn’t pass the smell test and would strike mostly impoverished communities with more pollution. This bill has the oil and gas industry’s fingerprints all over it. I would strongly suggest she distance herself from it (and her concerned constituents let her know she should), especially its worst parts, and try to find better legislation to support to help Americans through these tough times.

Lastly, this article (https://newrepublic.com/article/171454/republicans-lower-energy-costs-act-wont-lower-energy-costs) contains an excellent summary of why H.R. 1 will not lower prices or help Americans. It’s by an experienced energy reporter.",vancouverwa,Gluesenkamp Perez 1 of 4 Dems to back Republicans’ plan to 'unleash' American energy,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/1280a72/gluesenkamp_perez_1_of_4_dems_to_back_republicans/

I'm an atheist myself but religion doesn't weird me out and I'm not the kind of parent that wants to stop my kids from spirituality.

He'd like to start going to church and I do have some restrictions that I'm going to put into place. Really just two. 

1. I have a trans daughter who is about 10 years old and she's not interested in church but if she goes to church or if my son goes to church (he's 7) I'd like to ensure there isn't rhetoric of anti-LGBTQ rights and they are inclusive. 

2. My son seems to gravitate toward Christianity so I'd like to keep that as our baseline for religion. I know Christianity isn't very specific but honestly, I'm not super informed about religion in any way. 

Anything else I should be thinking about before venturing into a church with my son?

Also not sure if it matters but my trans daughter probably won't go to church again my goal is that my son won't learn any bigotry and if my daughter wants to go she have a place where she won't be treated poorly by the people running the church.",vancouverwa,Church for kids (trans),0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tqnhlu/church_for_kids_trans/

I saw this pattern repeated throughout the store with different people. I asked the person attending self checkout if the store loosened mask restrictions or something and she said no and that she herself said the amount of non-compliers seemed unusual that day.

I shop at that Winco often and it's not unusual to see one or two isolated people not complying but otherwise, mask compliance is surprisingly good for a store in rural Clark County, so this was really unusual - like maybe it was a coordinated effort to defy the mask protocol by a group of people.

Recently there has been some irritation about the density of posts for people seeking patients to apply for their dental hygiene board exams. I figure no matter which policy we apply, someone will be sad, so I am going to be do the scummiest thing possible and diffuse responsibility among everyone by holding a poll. 

We have identified the following courses of action that would be amenable. 

* **Leave them alone:** Really I don't mind them too much. There's some standards I'd like them held, but overall they're maybe like four or five in a two week period a couple times a year and it helps people out if they can meet the requirements.
* **Ban them outright:** This is the self-explanatory, totally Jokerfied choice.
* **Restrict them to our new and wildly popular self-promotion thread:** Nestled among the hand-crafted soaps, quirky art prints, and presumably fantastic hot sauces, these posts can find an audience of curious passers-by and remain relevant for a long period of time.
* **Create a mega-thread:** The first one of these posts we notice will elicit creation of a megathread that will be stickied for a couple weeks (unless it gets pre-empted by an important news/event sticky). That post and any subsequent posts will be removed and asked to use the megathread. Someone could probably also call Clark and see what their timelines are for this sort of thing so we can just schedule one out in advance.

These are four options we came up with - please note that I cannot edit the poll once I have posted so if someone has a really mind-blowing great idea in the comments I might take it down and start the process over.

> 
> * No parties larger than 5 guests (per Phase 2 restrictions)
> * All service staff will be wearing masks.
> * To maintain social distancing, only 1 party may remain inside the entryway while waiting to be sat by the host or servers.
> * If tables are full, you may check in on our Yelp Waitlist tablet. From there, you can wait outside with your party (where social distancing is encouraged) or wait in your car, and we will text when it's time to be seated.
> * Hand sanitizing stations are available at the main entrance and throughout the restaurant.
> * We are not requiring masks. However, it is strongly encouraged to wear one while not eating & getting up to leave your table.
> * Single use menus will be used. Condiments will be available upon request, and will be sanitized after each guest. The tables & chairs will also be wiped down & sanitized for the next guest.
> * The bathrooms will be cleaned & monitored hourly.
> * We ask that while at the restaurant, you please respect each guest as everyone has their own level of comfort during this time. If you have any issues please direct them to your server & we will do our best to resolve them.
> 
> Additionally, our permanent hours of operation have changed from Mon to Thu 11am – 9pm, Fri to Sun 11am – 10pm. Our patio will be opening in a couple of weeks. There are some last-minute maintenance issues that still need to be addressed before we can use that space. Thank you for your patience in contending with our limited indoor seating.

> Unfortunately, due to unreasonably high commission fees, we’ve had to discontinue our use of the delivery apps like Doordash and Postmates. We may revisit using them again in the future once they revise their business models that will allow us to be profitable. For now, online ordering (our preferred carryout ordering method) will be available through our website, or you may call the restaurant to place your order.

Today for the first time since restrictions were lifted, I went to a restaurant and ordered some beers. Social distancing was good and the wait staff wore masks and no gloves. Gloves might be good as a reminder for staff to keep their hands away from their face, but other than that I don’t see a difference if gloves are worn or not. My question is I watched the waitress clear a table and in picking up the glasses grabbed them by the rim. She then went inside and while I couldn’t see what she was doing, and don’t know if hand washing took place, but she brought our beers to the table holding the rim. I thought, hmm so now what was ever in that other persons mouth is now on our glasses.

PeaceHealth is evaluating and planning for several PeaceHealth Medical Group outpatient COVID-19 testing sites. With national shortages of COVID-19 test kits and PPE, we are determining how and when these testing sites could best serve the needs of our communities while also aligning with our overall emergency response plan. **These testing sites are NOT operational or available to patients at this time.** As part of the planning process, trailers are currently being delivered to five communities: 

>1. Bellingham, WA: 708 East Chestnut Street

PeaceHealth is implementing temperature screenings for all visitors and caregivers as they enter our facilities. Non-contact thermometers are being delivered to locations. Any individual with a temperature of 100 degrees or above will not be allowed to enter and provided the appropriate instructions on seeking care. 

PH Medical Group has started launching its telemedicine program system wide. This allows patients to get their healthcare services without having to leave their homes, when appropriate, based on their needs. Telephone appointments will be offered:

>To patients with already scheduled appointments that can't be postponed to a later date

>To patients scheduling new appointments, including screenings for COVID-19 related concerns.

**Prioritize self care**: Experiencing anxiety during this COVID-19 pandemic is normal. We are temporarily entering a new rhythm of life. In times like these, it is especially important to pay attention to your mental health.

As a part of PH’s conservation strategy flu tests will no longer be given in the ED or inpatient settings. 

As part of a phased implementation over the next two days, all elective surgeries will be suspended. 

We are actively monitoring daily patient volumes, and we’re not seeing an increase in ED volume or inpatient admissions at this time. We are also seeing lower than normal flu activity. We continue  to develop strategies that will ensure we are prepared for a potential surge in patients.

3/13/20 update from PH SWMC: 

COVID-19 cases: With increased testing, this data is still being gathered

PH is sending COVID-19 tests to Quest Labs. Currently receiving results in approximately 30 hours. 

There is currently a nationwide shortage of COVID-19 test kits and limited capacity of labs to analyze results. Testing is not currently available to the general public in our communities. At this time, PeaceHealth hospitals and clinics are only testing people for COVID-19 who fall into several high-risk categories. This includes those needing to be admitted to our hospitals, and those who are at highest risk of spreading the virus to others, including healthcare and public safety workers. We hope to be able to provide more testing in the future and will continue to reevaluate as testing capabilities increase across the nation.

This is a group for support, encouragement, and fellowship with others who have chosen to live the low carb/high fat/keto/carnivore lifestyles. Let's face it folks, our path is a bit unique and it can be helpful to have someone to chat with who understands the journey and can appreciate discoveries you've made or obstacles you've faced.

The group will be meeting in a variety of settings Some of our meetings will be relaxed and intimate such as group coffee sessions, while others might be more active such as a group walk down the Burnt Bridge Creek Trail.

Please be conscious that everyone's path is unique and personal. We will not encourage discussions such as ""that's not keto!"" or ""you can't eat that!"" . There will be some of you that restrict carbs to under a hundred and have a lot of flexibility while others have chosen the carnivore path and eat no carbs at all. Some of you might enjoy sugar free sweets and others may find they can't tolerate such things. Some of you might be years into your journey and others may be just beginning. We will encourage each other on the path they are on, and not try to bend them to join our own paths.

Current events have been distracting and I've been wrestling with the idea of getting involved.

I have a two year old GSD that is neutered, well-socialized and he's the biggest sweetheart in the world. I am trying to get a feel for suitable housing that would accept large breeds. I've owned him since he was 10 weeks old and I've spent a lot of time training him to be an absolute pleasure to be around and he interacts very well with other animals.

I've browsed a few of the newer complexes in the community and all seem to have breed restrictions. I've tried calling numerous locations with no luck (can't seem to get a person on the phone?) to learn more about the community and breed restrictions. 

So, my questions to you guys -- do you know of any apartment complexes that are safe and large-breed friendly? 

We are very open to the idea of renting a home, but I do not know too many search sites or realtors in the area that have a better feel for the local market.

My wife and I will be visiting the area this weekend (01/10/2020 - 01/13/2020).  We are heading with the idea of evaluating the area as a place to move.  While it is a short visit, we would love to understand the local flavor and vibe of the area.  Would any of you have any advice for places to see or experience while we are there to better understand what it is like to live in the area?

Some things we have tried to keep in mind:

* It's not all sunshine and rainbows, vising when the weather is ""bad"".
   * Trying to do this by coming in January
* Walk around the brand new pier at the Waterfront.
* Head to a local brewery
   * Heathen is currently on the list
* Check out some local dining
   * Gotta Eat.  Currently looking at the Feral Pub, Vinnie's Pizza and maybe La Bottega.
* Spending at least part of a day in the Farmers Market
* Hit up at least one local coffee shop.

Obviously we also have a bit of time scheduled to look at residential areas with a real estate agent.  Would you add anything to our itinerary?  Would you take anything out?  What and why?

Anyone have any experience with dumpster diving in this area? 

From my research, Dumpster Diving isn't illegal unless your area(city, county, etc) has no laws prohibiting it and that:

1. You are not trespassing
2. The dumpster is not locked
3. The dumpster is not in a locked enclosure

I'm not quite sure where you would find a dumpster that isn't on private property, but I wonder if stores really care if you're rummaging in their trash, depending on where their dumpster is located.

Anyone have a better understanding of the local legality regarding dumpster diving(particularly here and Camas, but any knowledge of the surrounding area would be welcome)? Anyone ever find anything good? :)",vancouverwa,Dumpster Diving,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/1vdwyb/dumpster_diving/
