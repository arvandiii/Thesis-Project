I'm currently working in a position where it's basically part-time since I can't honestly justify my current job to basically hang around and WAIT for something to do until the end of the day. I don't feel that is fair to my employer to basically milk hours with my thumb up my ass for the majority of 8 hours a day so I usually call it at the half-way mark at most and come back tomorrow unless I'm actually needed, which is rare.

I certainly have no wish to outright leave/switch jobs. I truly like my job and the people I work with. They're good people and I trust them as they seem to trust me, in turn. The medical and partial dental benefits just happen to be icing on the cake, really.

That, however, limits my ability to obtain NEW employment that would allow for only part-time that ALSO just isn't something I'd probably be fired at on day one because I will not tolerate being needlessly rushed and reprimanded because the demands of such jobs would be stressful and/or overwhelming and giving me extreme anxiety (things like fast food and that sort of thing).

No matter how much job-searching I do, it's always the same things being listed on repeat that just won't do. Even if I did get over my loyalty to my current employer, the prospects are all things that, not either but rather BOTH are skilled professions I do not have the ability to perform nor have the time to take off to learn and are related to professions I have no interest in, anyway.

I fully understand that Dawson Creek has never been a place for...to put it mildly, ""creative minds"". I want to work towards the end of entertaining people in some capacity but that is so horrifically niche that unless I know people in the right places......well, I don't really KNOW anyone. Not really, anyway.

So as much as I like writing and video-editing and being a general ""idea"" person with all those sorts of traits who has a relatively good grasp on how to present things to people, it's not a realistic prospect of employment up here. Anything that even kinda-maybe-sorta could be a stepping stone in the semi-right direction just plain isn't hiring in the first place, from everything I've been told despite numerous queries and resumes over the years prior to this COVID stuff.

It is beyond frustrating to be constrained to either zipping my lips and hoping a standard catch-all resume randomly drums up a few off-remarks about potential leads (which I will admit granted me ONE job lead here years ago that I thoroughly enjoyed and felt I was reasonably skilled at until I was no longer needed) or potentially be an annoying little shit who doesn't know how to shut up and try and try and try and try to make small-talk with a more ""liberally-worded"" resume, for lack of a better term.

I know life isn't perfect and sometimes you have to just do what you absolutely hate, even if you wish you had a gun in your nightstand and could wake up every frigging morning by putting it in your mouth and laying there for 10 minutes, wondering if you have the guts to pull the trigger that day, but the traditional stance on things that I've encountered in my life is there is never any room for compromise on the OTHER person's side, only my own and sacrificing any shred of something resembling a vague concept of potential happiness just because I'm the one in a compromised position, not them.

I'm sorry if this seems like mindless rambling to everyone but it's how I genuinely feel and I don't know how I'm ever going to move up in life and not just be desperately living paycheque to paycheque until I have a breakdown and throw what little I DO have away because I won't be able to handle the mental and emotional strain this has on my life.",dawsoncreek,I've tried the limited official resources to help me with employment MANY times but I feel they're only token gestures.
