female moving to kamloops hey y’all i’m moving to your neck of the woods! i’m looking for any tips, and things i should know? neighbourhoods to avoid living in? best food places and things to do. any knowledge you’d like to share with me is greatly appreciated. no need to add that rent is expensive and hard to come by as i am already aware. a little about me - i’m pretty quiet and don’t party. i don’t drink, smoke, or partake in anything. i’m pretty boring tbh hahaha but i work a lot. i love good food and am a big foodie. i also enjoy hiking and outdoor activities. but would love to hear what you all do for fun! thanks in advance!!

just a little post where people can roast the smoke. hey, smoke, you think you’re so cool just because james dean and clint eastwood used to inhale you. but deep down inside you know you’re dirty, disgusting and nothing but an annoyance. sure, they say that during a drought you can take a smoke bath. you know who takes smoke baths these days? nobody. we have soaps with lotions and creams. you, on the other hand, are good for making beef jerky. i don’t want to smell like beef jerky. it’s not a flattering perfume. you’re the worst thing about a campfire. like an unwanted guest at a cocktail party you hover and mingle in the faces of people who just want to roast their weenies, perhaps toast their buns on the metal grill and keep warm. but no…you gotta get up in everybody’s faces and make people crazy until they start screaming nonsensical words like *white rabbits* over an over again like inmates at the hickory farms insane asylum. i was walking down enterprise earlier today and there was this dude screaming *white rabbits! i hate white rabbits!* at the top of his lungs. he wasn’t a crazy street person. he wasn’t on drugs. he said he was the freaking mayor. i asked the mayor, “what’s wrong?” i shook his hand and said, “you’re doing a good job. this smoke isn’t your fault. none of this is your fault…” “white rabbits…white rabbits. they used to be on enterprise, but now they are on harvey and only i can see them!” maybe that guy wasn’t really the mayor. perhaps he was crazy. or perhaps you made him crazy, smoke. do you want to know why people say *i hate white rabbits* when you get all up in our faces? well, it’s an interesting story that dates itself to the boy scouts. apparently a camp councillor told the kids that smoke was made of billions of tiny white rabbits, fluttering about in random trajectories by the wind and the heat of the flames. the story gained enough traction to become an urban legend. but the real question we have to ask is, what the hell were you doing hanging around with a bunch of underage children, smoke? and why were you prancing around their bodies doings little seductive dances? if you don’t quit that behaviour ronan farrow gonna write a *vanity fair* article about you. okay, i will concede you do make a hotdog taste better. but why must you insist on smoking all the humans? what are you planning, smoke? why are you trying to seal in all our succulent juices? i think it is time to leave town, smoke. while you might be the inspiration for wayne wang’s second best movie, your time has come to pass. the problem is you are lazy. you just sit there, doing nothing like a nihilistic teen asking adults if they can by them cigarettes outside the 7-11. you have no skills outside of flavouring meats and signalling nomadic hunter gatherers when they can’t find their iphones. and yet, some day soon a hard rain will fall, or perhaps a mild breeze will dance down this valley and carry you away. and as you drift away from our memories until next fire season, remember: you are not made of little rabbits. you are a suspension of airborne particles and gasses mixed with air. technically you are an unwanted byproduct of fire. that’s right, smoke, even fire doesn’t want your lazy ass hanging around. and neither do we.
Document #52:
apartment below likes to hotbox his bathroom the guy below my apartment smokes weed in his house and it comes up the vents and stinks up my place. i'm 99% sure it's him because i'm an end unit and my neighbor is an 88 year old widow. above me and beside him, are people i work with and know well. below me and beside the suspected weed guy is another elderly lady. also i know where his car is parked and it smells like a teenage stoners car. i've contacted strata twice now and all they do is ask him if he was smoking inside, he denies it and then strata tells me it wasn't him and to keep investigating the smell. the last 3 times i've smelt it, i went downstairs and knocked on his door and he never answers. the second time i even left a note asking to stop smoking inside. dude why are you smoking doobies indoors? get a vape or something like a responsible adult. is there any way to prove it's him? any ideas? i've yet to be able to make face to face contact but i'm sure he knows what i look like from the peephole on his door. he will probably deny it anyway.

vancouver to calgary: wildfires? hello all. i will be taking a driving trip from vancouver to calgary in the last week of august via whistler and kamloops, and now am wondering if i made a huge mistake booking this, because the route passes somewhat close to wildfire areas. i'm not even as concerned about driving through those areas, since there are no road closures. but is it insensitive of my tourist ass to add another vehicle to the road being used by people fleeing the natural disaster? i can no longer cancel anything that's already booked. best i can do i just... not go... and lose the road trip i've been dreaming of for half of my life :s. not sure if i'm overthinking this, or what is the alternative now. thanks for any insight!

process begins for notification of property status wednesday, august 23, 2023 - 17:28[mcdougall creek wildfire 2023]( kelowna, b.c. – the emergency operations centre has launched an online search tool for city of west kelowna, westbank first nation and central okanagan west electoral area properties that have experienced partial to full structure loss resulting from the mcdougall creek wildfire. property owners who have been placed on evacuation order can search to see if their property has incurred losses by visiting [ if your property has not been placed on evacuation order, your address will not show. the emergency operation centre asks the general public to be respectful of this process – if you are not on evacuation order do not use the search tool. the search tool follows the work of canada task force 1 team, which completed assessments to identify properties that incurred losses in the wildfires. this was the first step in aiding in the public notification process. further hazard assessments must now be completed at each property, to determine the number and types of structures lost on each property. that process is completed in the city of kelowna and district of lake country. the process will take longer but remains a priority in the communities of west kelowna, westbank first nation and the regional district of the central okanagan west electoral area where losses have been greater. to date, three of the four property owners in kelowna and three properties in lake country have been contacted to confirm significant structural damage on their properties. these properties are not included in the search tool. the eoc expresses condolences to everyone who has experienced losses from the mcdougall creek, clifton/mckinley and lake country wildfires. “some of the most challenging days are ahead. people and communities will learn of monumental loss. this will be a process of grief collectively. as we move into recovery, the needs of each impacted community will be different,” said loyal wooldridge, regional district of central okanagan chairperson. “communities have experienced great impacts and losses and will take more time to recover. i am confident that our collective resilience will guide us forward,” wooldridge said. “let us honour the sacrifice and efforts made by so many over the past few days by confronting these challenges with unity and compassion. united as a region, we will recover, rebuild and restore.” residents currently on evacuation order are strongly encouraged to register with emergency support services at [ to ensure contact information for any affected property owners is up to date. much more info [here]( **—->** [**search tool**]( **<—-**

more housing: 650 non-market apartments in false creek north. "i'm concerned it'll block my view of false creek" \[update: passed unanimously! video of the public hearing: [ a huge thank-you to everyone who wrote in. that was an amazing response - more than 800 people sent in comments in support. [the agenda]( has a link to everyone's comments.\] tldr: we have a terrible shortage of housing, especially affordable housing. the province has agreed to build three non-market rental buildings in false creek north, including two high-rises, with a total of 650 apartments. the city still needs to say yes. there's a public hearing thursday afternoon, and there’s significant opposition (27 comments opposed, 3 in support). if you'd like to counterbalance the opposition (or if you're also opposed!), it takes literally 60 seconds to [submit a comment]( it can be as simple as "i support this plan." just set the subject to "false creek north non-market housing." &#x200b; [non-market housing is planned for sites 3, 4, and 5]( when false creek north (the former expo lands) was being planned for redevelopment, the goal was always to have it be mixed-income, with 20% non-market homes. over the last two or three decades there's been 540 non-market homes built (i think a bit less than half of the target), but there were long delays in getting anything else built. the city of vancouver announced in february that it had reached an agreement with concord pacific to acquire three sites in false creek north for non-market housing, between granville bridge and cambie bridge. bc housing will build a 28-storey building, a 29-storey building, and a seven-storey building, all with non-market housing. the proposal also includes a new fire hall and a daycare. there'll be a total of about 650 homes. you sometimes hear housing skeptics say, "we don't need more housing, we need more *affordable* housing." they're wrong (we need both!), but it's certainly true that there’s a huge shortage of housing that’s affordable to people with regular jobs. there's limits to how much non-market housing you can build, because unlike market housing, it requires public subsidy (typically contributions of land or capital). but when there's an opportunity to get 650 non-market homes built, with construction fully funded by the province, it seems like a good idea to take it. the target is that 30% will be "low end of market" (helping to cross-subsidize the lower-income apartments, but run on a non-profit basis), 50% will be lower-income (household income below a certain threshold), and 20% will be "deeply affordable" (shelter/pension rate). the lower-income thresholds are: annual household income of up to $58,000 for a 1br or studio, $72,000 for 2br, $86,000 for 3br. 25% of the apartments will be 2br or 3br, so suitable for families. because these are non-market rather than market, i expect there’ll be an application process to apply for them. (for an example of what this might look like, see the application process for [catalyst community development’s rental buildings]( but for renters (more than half of vancouverites), this helps even if you’re not living there yourself: when there’s 650 renter households who are living in non-market rentals, that’s 650 fewer households competing for market rentals. when we’re trying to drive up the vacancy rate, everything helps. thing is, **non-market housing runs into exactly the same obstacles as market housing**. the city’s zoning is quite restrictive, and actually allowing bc housing to build these projects requires the city to change its laws. so there’s been several months of public consultation, and now a rezoning hearing thursday afternoon. it looks like there’ll be a fair amount of opposition. confusingly, the city’s term for non-market housing aimed at lower-income households is “social housing,” but it also has an entirely separate category for “supportive housing,” i.e. housing for people who are homeless or destitute. this is non-market, mixed-income housing, not supportive housing. reading through the comments from opponents, a lot of people talk about “increased criminal burden.” i think they’re imagining that this will be supportive housing. comments from opponents: * i'm concerned my view of false creek will be blocked, and feel that the space could be better used as a park. * the initial plan to build 8 storey buildings was what drove us to buy at 930 cambie street. this updated plan is jeopardizing the value of our condo and obliterating the views of false creek we currently enjoy. this change of plan is unacceptable. * an excessively large development could lead to overcrowding, increased traffic congestion, limited parking spaces, and decreased privacy for residents. such negative impacts would compromise the character and charm of our community, potentially diminishing property values and causing distress to current homeowners. * this project will obviously damage yaletown and increase the criminal burden of our communities! * social housing needs to be balanced with market housing to integrate all members of society, to ensure integration, diversity and safety. having 2 large high rises concentrated in one small area risks creating an area that is no longer safe for tourists on the false creek walkway, children and families in cooper's park. more: * [agenda]( for the public hearing * [previous post]( * frances bula on the [obstacles faced by non-market housing]( may 2021 * [hamilton non-profits face 'infuriating' delays to build affordable housing, as city looks to change]( april 2023. similar stories from hamilton. part of [a series](

globe editorial: cities promise housing – and then make new rules that prevent it. [victoria’s missing middle a failure]  cities promise housing – and then make new rules that prevent it: politicians, most of whom are homeowners, have long failed to see the urgency in the country’s housing market victoria early this year approved a citywide overhaul of its restrictive zoning to get more housing built. and, then, nothing happened. vancouver is poised this fall to approve a citywide overhaul of its restrictive zoning to get more housing built – and city planners predict very little will happen. how is it that splashy plans to enact major changes lead directly to an entrenchment of the status quo? it’s the difference between the headline goal – loosening rules to permit multiple homes on lots long reserved for a detached home – and the detailed regulations that end up undermining that goal and effectively ensure nothing much changes. the housing market is tilted against new buyers and renters, with existing and new supply running well below demand. this is the root cause of canada’s housing supply squeeze and blame can be pinned on local politicians who oversee rules that allow – and mostly disallow – new housing. for decades, the only thing you could build on most residential land was a detached home. vancouver is a good example. more than 80 per cent of the land has been occupied by 35 per cent of the people. in recent years, the cost of housing surged to dizzying levels. restrictions on supply have been compounded by ever-stronger demand from a rising population. as of last year, loud calls for changing the rules finally rang through at city councils previously impervious to the idea. victoria at first appeared to be the leader of change. the city’s missing middle policy – multiunit housing of several storeys in height – was approved in january. it allows six homes on one lot and in some cases as many as a dozen, without a contentious, expensive and elongated rezoning process. yet the city then piled on numerous rules, including building height, parking and added costs. it’s akin to opening a door and immediately bolting it shut. the result is a policy that was supposed to help get many new homes built led to development applications of zero new homes. vancouver expects a similar result. city council this fall is set to approve a plan that would allow as many as six homes on one lot. the city calls it “very bold.” but the city plans to impose extra costs and heavily limit the size of buildings. the city itself predicts the plan will see only 150 new multiplexes built per year – just several hundred homes. in a city desperate for housing, vancouver’s reaching for a garden house to fight a wildfire. politicians, most of whom are homeowners, have long failed to see the urgency in the country’s housing market. leaders at higher levels of government have finally moved to intervene, such as in ontario and british columbia. despite these efforts, the main problem remains mayors and city councils that are doing as little as possible. four homes on one lot is definitely a step forward, if the rules were crafted to actually get such projects built. but it’s not enough, when the goal is to moderate sky-high prices to buy and rent. vancouver and toronto need to allow four-storey apartment buildings, with dozens of homes in each, to be built across the city, especially around public assets such as schools and parks. right now, such buildings are allowed on a fraction of civic land. while victoria and vancouver make missteps, toronto shows some promise. the city in may allowed up to four homes on one lot and didn’t layer on onerous restrictions. it is a good although modest first step. olivia chow, the new mayor, has pledged to back new housing. a push from the province, with specific housing targets, has made a difference, too. data indicate toronto is opening up to new homes: housing starts in the city are up about 50 per cent since the start of 2022, compared with the two previous decades. toronto, however, is an exception. most other cities in ontario are way behind. victoria, meanwhile, has realized its mistakes. the city is reviewing its new rules, to see where it went wrong, and plans more changes this fall. vancouver city council has a chance this fall at a public hearing to also loosen its plans before it locks in rules that it knows will lead to little change. canada needs a lot more new housing. civic leaders must stop undermining that essential goal by making sure the fine print supports the headline promise to build many more homes. the big picture is obvious. getting the details right is what will make a real difference.

some more details on council's upcoming "missing middle" proposal and hearing on september 14th at 1pm, city council is holding a [public hearing]( concerning amendments to the zoning bylaw which would make it easier to build "missing middle" housing. if you don't usually or haven't ever participated in a public hearing, this would be a fantastic one to make your first as it has significant implications for denser housing developments in the city. if you aren't interested in speaking, council makes it easy to communicate your support/opposition [in writing]( (put adding missing middle housing and simplifying regulations – amendments to the zoning and development by-law in the subject field). this was already posted [a few days ago]( but i wanted to write up a summary to better inform people because, again, this is a *really* important proposal. in short, if passed, this application would (among many other things - i strongly recommend reading pages 7-17 of the [referral report]( for a more detailed overview): **1. allow for the construction of "missing middle" residential buildings on lots zoned for single detached houses.** current zoning laws generally allow only for either a single detached house or a duplex to be constructed in rs zones alongside secondary units (laneway houses and basement suites). the vast majority of the city is zoned under one of nine different rs zoning types, meaning any construction denser than a duplex needs to go through a lengthy hearing process without a guaranteed outcome. this proposal would amend the zoning and development by-law to permit construction of up to 4 units on a standard lot (minimum 306m2, 64% of rs lots), 5 units on mid-size lots (minimum 464m2, 13.6% of rs lots), 6 units on larger lots (minimum 557m2, 22.4% of rs lots), and up to 8 units on larger lots when the construction includes purpose-built rental housing. these new higher-density constructions would have a maximum floor space ratio (fsr) of 1.0, meaning that the maximum total usable floor space of these buildings would be the total area of the lot they're built on. however, new constructions with an fsr of 0.7-1.0 would need to pay a "density bonus contribution", a fee tied to the total square footage of the construction which scales with the number of units and the geographic area of the construction (see page 15 of the [referral report]( new constructions would have this fee waived if they include at least one unit at below-market prices, or secure every unit as purpose-built rentals. all constructions would be limited to three stories. **2. consolidate the nine different single detached house zoning types into a single new zoning type (r1-1)** **3. reduce the maximum size of new single detached houses** all new constructions of single detached houses would have their maximum fsr reduced from 0.7 to 0.6. the referral report for this application reasons this will "discourage the replacement of existing houses with new larger houses by reducing the floor area for a new single detached house." **4. increase the maximum size of laneway houses** laneway houses will have their maximum fsr increased by ~55%, from 0.16 fsr to 0.25 fsr. **my takes** * in general, i'm a fan of most of the stuff in this application. middle-density housing is desperately needed in vancouver, and this goes a long way to getting more of it built by including it in existing zoning bylaws. the rezoning process is a significant bureaucratic hurdle to denser housing constructions, and removing it will vastly speed up construction. this also means that these constructions will not be subject to the frustrating rezoning hearing process. however, this is still removing only one bureaucratic hurdle of many. * i'd like to see this proposal go a bit further. you can fit a lot more than 6 units in a 3 story apartment when the lot is large enough, so increasing the number of units allowable on the particularly large lots around the city would be a nice addition to this proposal. * the 1.0 fsr is too small for these constructions, and is the part of this application i'm most annoyed at. fsr for middle-density constructions needs to be bumped above 1.0, particularly for higher-density constructions. if the maximum single detached house fsr gets reduced to 0.6, this means you could potentially be building 8x the units on in only 1.65x the space, or only 1.15x if you want to avoid paying additional fees. this is how we get smaller, cramped units, which may not incentivize developers enough to construct middle-density housing. * the "density bonus contribution" is the second thing i'm unhappy with, particularly the fee scaling with unit numbers and geographic location. essentially, this disincentivizes developers against both building denser developments (which is against the whole point of this proposal!) and building them where they're needed most (in the west side, aka area a). given that margins for infill housing are already [pretty tight]( (shoutout /u/russilwvong), this really strikes me as a poison pill clause, where council wants to be seen as taking action to promote middle-density developments, but doesn't actually want them to be built for fear of angering their voter base. indeed, give the bc government's upcoming requirement to allow 4 units on lots zoned for detached homes, this seems like council's attempt to restrict construction while still complying with the provincial government's regulations. * the consolidation of single detached house zoning types is sorely needed and a good step in the right direction for reducing and clarifying zoning rules. this should make constructions slightly easier, though likely not faster (which is what's really needed). * reducing the maximum size of single detached houses is... fine? i guess? it's an interesting thing to tag on here. this should disincentivize people from buying up lots for houses for sale just to rebuild them into larger houses, and instead incentivize building denser multi-unit constructions. but, if this is council's goal, there's better and more effective ways to go about this. * the increased size of laneway houses is a very welcome change for laneways that actually get built, but this doesn't solve the primary issue with laneway construction which is the absurd approval process and timeline. but hey, this is still a nice addition. in conclusion, there's a lot to like about this application, and a few things that could do with some changing before council approves it. but it's important to note that this is only one step towards getting more middle-density constructions going in this city; council still needs to work on improving permitting timelines and reducing other bureaucratic hurdles developers face when trying to construct denser infill housing. regardless, this is still a good step in the right direction.

where can i go to report a neighbor anonymously for using their sprinkler to water their lawn during this heatwave and drought? its a heat wave, we haven't had good rain in probably a month now, there's wildfires everywhere and a water restriction. and this mfker is watering his lawn in the early early mornings to avoid getting caught. everyone is doing their part and not watering their lawns so we can have that water for drinking or other essential purposes. everyone's lawns are yellow and this guy's is bright green. where can i report him anonymously? edit: it seems that people are accusing me of wanting to report him after seeing him water a single time. that or they themselves sneakily water their lawns during the wrong days and don't want people reporting them. the reason i'm reporting him is because: he waters almost every day. he's an even numbered address so he should only be allowed to water on saturdays. he waters past 7am every day with sprinklers, you're supposed to stop before 7am and only on the allotted days. and he hasn't just redone his lawn nor has he applied for a water exemption because he is supposed to display the paid permit in the front and he has not. he is heavily breaking the water restriction laws and we're in the middle of a fking drought. that's why. i also love everyone's trying to come up with excuses for the watering and the moment i confirm that the neighbor is watering too much and not on the allotted time, everyone just shuts up or resorts to name calling. it's clear to me that people are unhappy with me because they probably also water outside the current water restriction rules and don't care about how there's a fking drought going on as long as their lawn looks pretty and green. funny how every time someone breaks rules, this subreddit screams for punishment and turns into discount judge dredd. and yet when homeowners are the ones breaking the rules, everyone suddenly acts like it's the fking la gang streets "no snitching, snitches get stitches, no one tell on anyone for over-watering. i want my lawn to be green i don't care if we need to save water during a fking drought"

"drought conditions worsen" but no advertising; people seem blissfully unaware re water we're been asked to conserve water by the bc government, but most people seem blissfully unaware that half the province is literally on fire. we are in an increasingly difficult drought situation. where is the advertising? is anyone aware of the water restriction guidelines? the municipality i live in (north saanich) doesn't say anything on its website. people watering in the middle of the day, washing their car with copious water, hay fields being sprayed with huge amounts of water in hot wind.... hello? hello? anyone?

Document #428:
the crd is the only place on the island not facing a water shortage right now from the article: “at stage 4, lawn sprinkling, filling pools and washing vehicles, driveways, parking lots and building are not allowed. stage 3 restrictions indicate people can water on alternate days during certain times and are asked to voluntarily reduce water use. “the capital regional district remains at stage 1 and has no immediate plans to move higher as the reservoirs in the regional water supply area remain high. the sooke lake reservoir, the main source of water for the crd, is at about 85% of capacity. “in fact, jen zimmerman of the crd’s integrated water services division, said the regional water supply hasn’t been at stage 2 or higher since the sooke lake reservoir dam was raised in 2003.” three cheers for whoever planned the sooke reservoir. i went on a tour there in 2022 and i remember them saying that at the current population we’d need to be in a drought continuously for six years before we’d start to have problems. our freshwater supply is about 2/3rd the size of greater vancouver’s, but we have less than 1/5th the population. and people in victoria also use way lest water than most people in north america too, so pat yourselves on the back while you’re at it.
