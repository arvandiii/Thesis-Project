Campfire Prohibition Partially Rescinded in Northwest Fire Centre,1694498400,"
SMITHERS – Effective at 12:00 p.m. (noon) on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, the Category 1 campfire prohibition was rescinded in the Cassiar Fire Zone, Skeena Fire Zone and Bulkley Fire Zone.
A Category 1 campfire is defined as an open fire that burns piled material no larger than 0.5 metres high by 0.5 metres wide. The following precautions must be in place when lighting or making use of a campfire:

There is ready access to a shovel or at least eight litres of water the entirety of the time the campfire is lit.
There is a fuel break around the campfire, free of any debris or combustible materials.
The fire is fully extinguished and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the campfire for any length of time.

Category 1 campfires are still prohibited in the Nadina Fire Zone. This includes the use of:

tiki and similar kinds of torches,
binary exploding targets,
burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description, and
air curtain burners.

Category 2 and Category 3 open burning remain prohibited across the entire Northwest Fire Centre, in addition to the use of:

fireworks, including firecrackers, and
sky lanterns.

Please check the Northwest Fire Centre’s bans and restrictions webpage for more information.
Prohibitions apply to all public and private lands unless otherwise specified (e.g. in an enactment or local government bylaw). Please check with your local authorities before lighting any fire.
Review the map outlining the prohibition areas for the Northwest Fire Centre.
Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused wildfires.
Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

Forecasted weather conditions expected to increase fire activity,1694325600,"
PRINCE GEORGE – Weather conditions across the Prince George Fire Centre continue to be warm, dry and sunny accompanied by moderate winds in all zones. Today winds are expected to increase in advance of an upper trough forecast to move across northern B.C., bringing a noticeable weather pattern change with a drop in temperatures and shift in wind direction.
Throughout Monday, zones east of the Rockies will see a significant increase in wind speeds with strong gusts possible, while winds in the zones west of the Rockies ease up slightly. Winds are expected to ease on Tuesday, however Wednesday is forecast to be a windy day across the entirety of the Fire Centre, especially east of the Rockies, where they will be moderate-to-strong. Conditions on Thursday see a return of warming and drying for the Fire Centre.
These winds, together with persistent drought conditions, little-to-no forecasted precipitation and continued warm and sunny days will lead to an increase in wildfire activity and smoke visibility across the region. Individuals in the vicinity of existing wildfires are encouraged to stay alert and aware of the current wildfire situation as wildfires are dynamic and conditions may change rapidly.
Current wildfire evacuation advisories are available online through EmergencyInfoBC. Individuals are also encouraged to know which regional district or local authority they are located in and to familiarize themselves with their communication channels.

Area restriction for the Jubilee Mountain wildfire rescinded,1694152800,"
CASTLEGAR– Effective immediately the Area Restriction that was established around the Jubilee Mountain wildfire (N22370), which originated approximately 19 kilometres southeast of Parson, B.C, will be rescinded. As the fire behaviour and activity has decreased, firefighting personnel no longer need to restrict public access to operate efficiently and safely in the area.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public that the Jubilee Mountain wildfire is an active worksite, and they should always exercise caution while travelling in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have the authority under the Wildfire Act and its regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Nearby communities can still expect to see smoke within the fire’s perimeter over the coming weeks. Smoke appearing from within the fire perimeter and burned material is common; however, smoke that rises from green, unburned fuel or from outside a fire’s perimeter should be reported immediately.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the bans and restrictions section of the BC Wildfire Service website for the Southeast Fire Centre.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire, or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – September 7, 2023",1694066400,"

Since April 1, 2023, 2,097 wildfires have burned over 2.25 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 411 active wildfires burning across the province. New wildfire activity remains stable and relatively quiet, with only eight new wildfires detected in the last three days. 
Warm temperatures will increase wildfire behaviour slightly over the weekend, and some incidents that have appeared dormant over the past week may exhibit smoke and flames, particularly in the Southern Interior and the southern portion of the Coastal Fire Centre. 
B.C. continues to gratefully receive support from Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Ontario, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and the Yukon. Over the coming week more than 150 additional resources are anticipated from the United States, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Personnel from the Canadian Armed Forces remain deployed in the Mackenzie, Vanderhoof and Fort St. James regions.
Weather
Southern regions of the province have received varied amounts of precipitation recently, most notably in the southeast. Meanwhile, above seasonal hot and dry conditions persist in northern regions.
Regions of the province continue to dry as areas with previous precipitation are impacted by lowering relative humidity in the eastern part of the province and locally gusty winds in the interior through the weekend. Winds are starting to increase in the north and are further impacting fire indices. Temperatures are above seasonal across much of the province. 
The longer term outlook is for generally dry conditions except for portions of the Northwest Fire Centre and the outer coast of B.C.

The next Provincial Wildfire Status Update will be provided on Sept 14, 2023.

Understanding Area Restrictions
There are currently multiple Area Restriction Orders in place on wildfires throughout British Columbia. 
A Restricted Area Order, or area restriction, is a legal document administered through a local Fire Centre to prohibit access to areas where there are ongoing fire suppression activities. They’re established to limit the risk of wildfire occurring or to enforce the continued need to protect the public and emergency service personnel in active wildfire areas.
When a Restricted Area Order is established under section 11(2) of the Wildfire Act, a person must not remain in or enter the restricted area without the prior written authorization of an official designated for the purposes of the Wildfire Act, unless the person enters the area only in the course of:

Travelling to or from his or her residence
Using a highway as defined in the Transportation Act
Travelling through or entering the area as a person acting in an official capacity that is connected or involved in incident operations
Travelling through or entering the area for a purpose approved by an official of supporting wildfire suppression activities

Refer to current fire bans and restrictions in your Fire Centre to see area restrictions that are in place.
All trails and backroads that are not included within the boundary of Restricted Area Orders, Evacuation Orders, or are otherwise under municipal jurisdiction, remain open for public use.

Category 1 campfire ban partially rescinded in Cariboo Fire Centre,1694066400,"
WILLIAMS LAKE – Effective at 12 p.m. (noon) PDT on Sept. 7, 2023, the Category 1 campfire prohibition will be rescinded in the Quesnel Forest District, 100 Mile House Forest District and the Cariboo-Chilcotin Forest District on the east side of the high-water mark of the Fraser River as shown in the map below.
23-Cariboo-MAP-RESCIND-S10-Prohibition-Color-8X11P-Legal-Sep06Download
Multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement or rescind Category 1 campfire prohibitions, including: current and forecasted weather conditions and fire behaviour; the availability of firefighting resources; and the Buildup Index (BUI).
A Category 1 fire, or campfire, is defined as an open fire that burns piled material no larger than 0.5 metres high and 0.5 metres wide. The following precautions must be in place when lighting or making use of a campfire:

There is ready access to a shovel or at least eight litres of water the entirety of the time the campfire is lit.
There is a fuel break around the campfire, free of any debris or combustible materials.
The fire is fully extinguished and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the campfire for any length of time.

A reminder that Category 2 and Category 3 prohibitions remain in place throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre, including the Tsilhqot’in (Xeni Gwet’in) Declared Title Area. The following activities, equipment, materials and substances are also currently prohibited:

Fireworks
Sky Lanterns
Burn Barrels or Burn Cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Air Curtain Burners

Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.
Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from naturally caused fires. Always practice safe, responsible open fire use.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone.

Area restriction for the Mount Bingay wildfire rescinded,1693893600,"
CASTLEGAR– Effective immediately the Area Restriction that was established around the Mount Bingay wildfire (N12546), which originated approximately 16 kilometres northwest of Elkford, B.C, will be rescinded. As the fire behaviour and activity has decreased, firefighting personnel no longer need to restrict public access to operate efficiently and safely in the area.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public that the Mount Bingay wildfire is an active worksite, and they should always exercise caution while travelling in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have the authority under the Wildfire Act and its regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Nearby communities can still expect to see smoke within the fire’s perimeter over the coming weeks. Smoke appearing from within the fire perimeter and burned material is common; however, smoke that rises from green, unburned fuel or from outside a fire’s perimeter should be reported.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the Bans and Restrictions section of the BC Wildfire Service website for the Southeast Fire Centre.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire, or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – August 31, 2023",1693461600,"
Since April 1, 2023, 2,025 wildfires have burned about 1.91 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 422 active wildfires burning across the province.
Unseasonably hot and dry conditions persist in the northern regions of the province, which has contributed to an increase in fire behaviour for parts of the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres. As a result of this increase in activity, the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality has issued an Evacuation Alert encompassing a large portion of the Fort Nelson Zone.
A Category 1 campfire ban came into effect today at noon for the Northwest Fire Centre and the VanJam, Mackenzie and Fort Nelson Zones in the Prince George Fire Centre, whereas the category 1 campfire ban in the Southeast Fire Centre will be rescinded as of noon tomorrow.
More than 3,500 personnel directly engaged in wildfire response efforts in B.C. This figure consists of BC Wildfire staff, contract personnel, and out-of-province personnel from Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Ontario and the Canadian Armed Forces.

Category 1 campfire prohibition to be rescinded in the Southeast,1693461600,"
CASTLEGAR – Effective at 12:00 noon PDT on Friday, September 1, 2023, campfires will again be allowed in the Southeast Fire Centre.
The BC Wildfire Service takes several factors into account before rescinding open burning prohibitions. This includes balancing the needs of the public with the need to mitigate the risk of human-caused wildfires. The combination of current and future forecasts, recent precipitation, and improved overnight recoveries has reduced the need to prohibit campfires in the Southeast.
As defined in the Wildfire Regulations, Category 2 and Category 3 open burning (any fire larger than 0.5 metres wide by 0.5 metres high) remains in effect throughout the Southeast Fire Centre. The following equipment and activities are also prohibited throughout the Fire Centre:

the use of sky lanterns
the use of fireworks
the use of air curtain burners
the use of burn barrels and burn cages
the use of binary exploding targets

A map of the affected areas and their associated prohibitions is available here.
Anyone lighting a campfire in an area where campfires are allowed must maintain a fireguard by removing flammable debris from around the campfire area, attend the fire at all times, and must have a hand tool or at least eight litres of water available nearby to properly extinguish the campfire. Before lighting a campfire, the public is urged to check with their local regional district or municipality for local open burning bylaws.
To report an abandoned campfire, wildfire, or open burning violation, call 1-800-663-5555 or *5555 on a cellphone.
Anyone found in contravention of an open fire prohibition may be issued a ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.

Area restriction for the Raymond Peak wildfire rescinded,1693375200,"
CASTLEGAR – Effective at 12 p.m. (noon) PDT on August 30, 2023, the Area Restriction established for the Raymond Peak wildfire (N12589) that originated 15 kilometres southeast of Elko, will be rescinded. As the fire behaviour and activity has decreased, firefighting personnel no longer need to restrict public access in the area.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public that the Raymond Peak wildfire is an active worksite, and they should always exercise caution while travelling in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have the authority under the Wildfire Act and its regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Nearby communities can still expect to see smoke within the fire’s perimeter over the coming weeks. Smoke appearing from within the fire perimeter and burned material is common; however, smoke that rises from green, unburned fuel or from outside a fire’s perimeter should be reported immediately.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the Bans and Restrictions section of the BC Wildfire Service website for the Southeast Fire Centre.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.

PRINCE GEORGE – Effective at 12 p.m. (noon) PDT on Thursday, August 31, 2023, Category 1 (campfires) are prohibited across the VanJam, Mackenzie and Fort Nelson fire zones in the Prince George Fire Centre. This prohibition applies to Category 1 open burning (campfires) as defined in the Wildfire Regulation.
This prohibition covers the Stuart, Mackenzie and Fort Nelson Forest Districts and will remain in effect until 12 p.m. (noon) on Sunday, October 15, 2023 or until it is rescinded. Prohibitions apply to all public and private lands unless otherwise specified (e.g. in an enactment or local government bylaw). A map outlining the area of this prohibition is below.

In addition to prohibiting the use of open fire of any size, the following activities are prohibited:
Fireworks
Sky lanterns
Burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Air curtain burners
Chimineas
Tiki and similar kinds of torches
Outdoor stoves or other portable campfire apparatus without a CSA or ULC rating

This prohibition does not include the use of outdoor stoves. As outlined in the Wildfire Regulation, an outdoor stove is a CSA-rated or ULC-rated rated device used outdoors for cooking, heat or ambiance, that burns charcoal briquettes, liquid fuel or gaseous fuel, and has a flame height less than 15 centimetres tall.
Please check the BC Wildfire Service Bans and Restrictions webpage for the most current prohibitions for your area.
Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.
View a map of the affected areas here.
Please note: Red indicates areas where all Category 1, 2 and 3 open fires are banned while yellow indicates Category 2 and 3 open fires are banned.
Multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement an open fire prohibition, including: current and forecasted weather conditions; the availability of firefighting resources; and the Buildup Index (BUI).
The BUI rating is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape. It takes into account the fuel’s moisture content, since that can affect fire intensity.
Campfire prohibitions are implemented based on the particular region’s BUI values. The BUI allows the province’s six fire centres to follow a consistent and scientific process for evaluating the need for campfire prohibitions.
Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused wildfires.

Another tool in the toolbox: satellite imagery,1693288800,"
Large fires can result in towering columns of heat which can be detected from satellite platforms. These platforms detect heat signatures and may contain positive signals for actual wildfire activity as well as heat and smoke columns, especially if the heat column is being deflected or collapsing outside of the fire parameters. Heat signatures from heated air are somewhat common with these tools. 
Satellite imagery and mapping tools (such as FIRMS or MODIS) can provide a general picture of fire activity but should not be relied on for details. The BC Wildfire Service regularly maps fires when conditions and resources allow, and updates are available on our interactive map, or on incident-specific pages.  
Satellite imagery is an important tool that wildland fire managers use to identify the general location, extent and intensity of wildfire activity and its effects. However, these tools do not always display accurate and precise information.  
MODIS and FIRMS use satellite sensors to record the intensity of electromagnetic radiation from Earth in various spectral wavelengths or channels. This means heat signatures are picked up by the satellite and the map is populated with pixels. The satellite can flag smoke, or large open areas such as cut blocks, as a heat signature. It will also pick up a heat signature if the ground around a fire is cooler than the fire itself, for example in the morning when the cooler temperatures around the fire can make the heat reading appear more intense than it really is. Other situations which can result in heat readings which are not necessarily indicative of where a wildfire is burning may include nighttime detections, large wildfires experiencing explosive growth, or a high scan angle.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – August 28, 2023",1693202400,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,944 wildfires have burned over 1.8 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 373 active fires burning across the province.
Existing wildfires in the north exhibited increased fire activity over the weekend. As a result, evacuation alerts were issued by the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality. Fire activity from the Little Blue River (R91162) wildfire, located approximately 40 km south of the Yukon border, resulted in the closure of Highway 37.
There are currently 129 evacuation orders and alerts in place across the province, affecting 22,342 properties under alert and 6,940 under order. For the most up-to-date evacuation information, please connect directly with your local authority or visit EmergencyInfoBC.
There are more than 3,500 personnel directly engaged in wildfire response efforts across the province, including hundreds of out-of-province personnel from Mexico, South Africa and Australia. Over 100 local fire departments are assisting in structure protection efforts across the province.
Weather
Lightning activity began overnight on Vancouver Island and will continue through the day while extending eastwards onto the mainland. Most of these strikes will be dry. Today will be the hottest and driest day of the week, with gusty northwest to westerly winds.
By mid week, some showers and cooler temperatures are expected over southern B.C. Rainfall will begin tomorrow over the Coast Range and Fraser Canyon and gradually track east across the Southern Interior. The amounts and extent of the rainfall remains uncertain.
Meanwhile, fire hazard continues to build across the north. These hot and dry conditions paired with a risk of dry lightning mid week in the northeast corner could result in new wildfire starts.

Area restriction for the Kamma Creek wildfire rescinded,1692770400,"
CASTLEGAR– Effective immediately on Wednesday, August 23, 2023, the Area Restriction that was established around the Kamma Creek wildfire (N71918) will be rescinded. As the fire behaviour and activity has decreased, firefighting personnel no longer need to restrict public access to operate efficiently and safely in the area.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public that the Kamma Creek wildfire is an active worksite, and they should always exercise caution while travelling in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have the authority under the Wildfire Act and its regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Nearby communities can still expect to see smoke within the fire’s perimeter over the coming weeks. Smoke appearing from within the fire perimeter and burned material is common; however, smoke that rises from green, unburned fuel or from outside a fire’s perimeter should be reported immediately.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the Bans and Restrictions section of the BC Wildfire Service website for the Southeast Fire Centre.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire, or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone. For the latest information on current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, road closures and air-quality advisories, visit: http://www.bcwildfire.ca or download the BC Wildfire App free for Apple and Android devices.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – August 21, 2023",1692597600,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,866 wildfires have burned about 1.73 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 379 active fires burning across the province.
Fire crews and incident management teams continue their work on significant complexes throughout the Kamloops Fire Centre and on the Kookipi Creek wildfire, with support from aviation and structure protection resources. On Monday, smoke continued to impact the ability for aviation resources to access fires, but improved visibility is expected in the days ahead.
There are more than 3,500 personnel directly engaged in wildfire response efforts across the province. This week, 100 additional personnel from Mexico will arrive to support local firefighting efforts followed by 200 South African personnel next weekend. Australia is once again stepping up to support with 18 specialized single resources. Over 100 local fire departments are assisting in structure protection efforts across the province.
Weather
Cooler temperatures and decreased relative humidity are helping to dampen fire activity today, and could be accompanied by measurable precipitation in the Southeast and Kamloops Fire Centres. Wind patterns may begin to reverse in the Okanagan, impacted by sub-tropical moisture off Hurricane Hilary moving westward. 
Tomorrow, additional precipitation is in the forecast with the potential for thunderstorms. Temperatures are dipping below seasonal in the south but conditions are forecast to remain warm and dry in the northern half of the province. This pattern will likely pull smoke out of the Southern and Central Interior.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – August 17, 2023",1692252000,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,818 wildfires have burned about 1.61 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 366 active fires burning across the province.
The BC Wildfire Service anticipates extreme fire behaviour in the next 48 hours caused by the collision of a hot upper ridge and an incoming cold front. We are focused first and foremost on the safety of crew members and the public during the challenging period ahead.
There are currently 59 Evacuation Orders and Alerts in place with 3,047 properties under Alert and 357 under Order across the province. These figures continue to change as the wildfire situation evolves. Yesterday evening, the Central Okanagan Regional District issued a wide-ranging Evacuation Alert for properties impacted by the McDougall Creek wildfire (K52767) west of Kelowna. For the most up to date information about Orders and Alerts please refer directly to your local authority or Emergency Info BC.
Weather
Today is the fourth consecutive day of extreme heat in B.C. This afternoon, the forecasted cold front will move south through the province, bringing with it high winds and dry lightning. Shifting winds gusting up to 50 kilometres per hour will increase the potential for fire spread, and are forecast to linger overnight. 
This system is expected to continue to impact the Central and Southern Interior for the next 48 hours. The trough of low pressure left in the wake of the cold front when it exits B.C. will continue to create instability in the upper atmosphere, which could bring additional windiness and lightning over the weekend.

Upcoming Weather Event,1692165600,"
PARKSVILLE – Over the last week in B.C., particularly in the southern half of B.C., a high-pressure ridge has created extremely hot and dry conditions. Tomorrow a dry cold front is forecast to move into the province creating instability, strong gusting winds, and the potential for dry lightning inland. Early detection of wildfires and public reporting will be crucial and increase the potential for initial attack success on new wildfire starts.
The Coastal Fire Centre would like to alert the public of the potential for aggressive fire behavior and high rates of spread during this event. We ask that everyone pay attention to local updates and alerts in your area. The BC Wildfire Service has released the following video describing this situation in more detail:

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – August 14, 2023",1691992800,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,788 wildfires have burned about 1.59 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 376 active fires burning across the province.
Nearly all regions of the province are experiencing increased fire behaviour resulting from hot temperatures combined with high winds. Despite challenging conditions, crews were able to successfully implement planned ignitions to consolidate containment on significant wildfires over the weekend, including Lladnar Creek and Downton Lake. 
There are currently about 4,000 personnel engaged in wildfire response across B.C. As some international resources demobilize, we continue to work with partner agencies and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre to secure the required resources.
Weather
An upper ridge of high pressure air has caused temperatures to climb to well above seasonal averages across the majority of the province. Coupled with high winds out of the west, the current pattern is fueling existing fires on the landscape. 
Later in the week, a cold front moving in from the northwest will collide with the upper ridge. This will likely result in even stronger winds, coupled with dry lightning, which may lead to additional new fire starts.

Structure Protection during wildfire season,1691992800,"
When a wildfire is threatening a structure, like someone’s home, the BC Wildfire Service deploys Structure Protection Specialists (SPS) to coordinate protection and defence. These experts, who bring a range of emergency response experience, operate out of trailers called Structure Protection Units (SPUs), which contain pumps, hoses, sprinklers and water delivery attachments and tools. SPUs are strategically placed across the province during wildfire season and transported to areas that may be threatened.

But how do Structure Protection Specialists determine where and how to deploy their resources?  Structure Protection Specialists prioritize the deployment of SPUs based on: ·       how “defensible” a property is (whether the SPU would be effective if it’s deployed there) ·       where the need for SPUs is greatest (based on anticipated fire growth and activity) ·       whether SPU resources are available to be deployed in the area  What makes a structure defensible?A defensible home has good FireSmart principles applied to the structure and surrounding area. This includes a range of activities - from cleaning out eaves, vents and gutters, and clearing brush, to considering fire-resistant building materials and plants and spacing out trees.   You can use the FireSmart Home Ignition Zone Assessment Score Card for your own property to see what changes will make the most significant difference in reducing your home’s risk from wildfire. More information about FireSmart is available at FireSmartBC.ca or FireSmartCanada.ca.



If a structure and the surrounding property are FireSmart, it will take less time to set up the necessary sprinklers to cover the structure. How do you determine the greatest need?This is determined by a wildfire’s proximity to a structure, the fire’s size, and its projected rate of growth. A defensible property that is most likely to be impacted by a particular wildfire will be prioritized for structural protection.
Wildfires are dynamic events, and a structure protection unit may be moved from one property and repositioned to another that is considered to be at a higher risk of ignition. These decisions are reassessed on a daily basis by planning specialists who analyze a particular incident as a whole to ensure the properties with the greatest need are defended.

The safety of first responders and firefighters is a primary consideration when Structure Protection Specialists make triaging decisions. It’s important to understand that it will not always be possible to defend structures, and the safety of people is BC Wildfire Service’s paramount concern.
How do they do it?
Structural Protection Units (SPUs), consisting of sprinkler systems specifically designed to defend structures, create a “humidity bubble” (streams of water) around structures that moisten roofs and other surfaces. This application of water can be effective in extinguishing airborne sparks and embers from wildfire.
Structure Protection Units are often deployed as a precautionary measure to dampen roofs and areas around structures. They are most effective if used in conjunction with properties that have applied FireSmart standard.
In addition to setting up a humidity bubble around the structure, crews can use the hoses and sprinklers to set up a “wet line” to slow or stop an advancing ground fire.
Defensible Structures Case Study: A FireSmart Community
In the village of Hudson’s Hope in the North Peace region of B.C., the community has worked hard to reduce the risk of structure loss to wildfires. This work was rewarded when the community was threatened by the Battleship Mountain wildfire in 2022.



In the video above, Hudson’s Hope Director of Protective Services, Brad Milton, explains how his community’s collaborative FireSmarting efforts made it easier to defend structures from wildfire, and increased safety for responders.

How does Structure Protection work?
When a wildfire presents an imminent threat to structures, such as homes, BC Wildfire Service’s Structure Protection Specialists will assess the structures to determine how defendable they are. A defensible home has good FireSmart principles applied to the structure and surrounding area.
It’s more likely that an SPU will be set up on a structure if it is on a property that has been “FireSmarted.” If a structure and the surrounding property are FireSmart, it will take less time to set up the necessary sprinklers to cover the structure.

Wildfire Update for the Southeast,1691474400,"
CASTLEGAR – Over the long weekend the Southeast Fire Centre has seen an increase in lightning-caused fire activity. Ground crews and aviation resources are responding to new incidents throughout the fire centre, though there is a concentration of high elevation targets located in the West Kootenays. At this time, none of these wildfires are threatening structures or infrastructure.
Ground crews that are being deployed to new wildfires include Initial Attack, Rappel, and Unit Crews. For more information on these crew types and how they work is available here.
Airtankers, including skimmers, and helicopters are working together to cool and slow fire growth ahead of ground crews; as well as delivering personnel and equipment on priority areas of fires as required. Aviation resources will be using bodies of water in and around the west kootenay region. The public is asked to be vigilant of their surroundings and move out of the way of aircraft while they are working.
Visible wildfires in the Kootenay Lake Zone include: 
Sandy Creek Wildfire (N72624)
Originated approximately seven kilometres southwest of Nelson on the South side of the Kootenay River. Is it estimated at 0.015 hectares in size.
West Kokanee Creek Wildfire (N72615)
Originated approximately 15 kilometres northeast of Nelson on the North side of the Kootenay River. It is estimated at 50 hectares in size.
Kokanee Creek Wildfire (N72620)

Area restriction for the St. Mary’s River wildfire rescinded,1691128800,"
CASTLEGAR – Effective immediately on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023, the Area Restriction that was established around the St. Mary’s River wildfire (N11805) will be rescinded. As the fire behaviour and activity has decreased, firefighting personnel no longer need to restrict public access to operate efficiently and safely in the area.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public that the St. Mary’s River wildfire is an active worksite, and they should always exercise caution while travelling in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have the authority under the Wildfire Act and its regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Reminder that Mission Wasa Low Road remains under an Evacuation Order at this time and entry to this area remains prohibited. Mission Road to LD Ranch Road remains closed for public access at this time while danger tree falling continues.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Nearby communities can still expect to see smoke within the fire’s perimeter over the coming weeks. Smoke appearing from within the fire perimeter and burned material is common; however, smoke that rises from green, unburned fuel or from outside a fire’s perimeter should be reported immediately.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the Bans and Restrictions section of the BC Wildfire Service website for the Southeast Fire Centre.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C. and Alberta border in the east.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – August 4, 2023",1691128800,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,586 wildfires have burned over 1.56 million hectares of land in B.C. Fire activity over the past few weeks has been steady, with periods of increased fire behaviour in the Kamloops and Southeast fire centres. This activity is expected to persist and potentially increase over the coming days due to hot, dry conditions and a risk of thunderstorms in areas where fuels are highly susceptible to ignition.
Nearly 4,000 personnel are currently engaged in wildfire response across B.C. This figure includes personnel from the BC Wildfire Service personnel, B.C. contract crews, the United States, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ontario, the Canadian Armed Forces and other support personnel.
There are currently 2,748 properties under Evacuation Alert and 683 properties under Evacuation Order. These figures continue to change as the wildfire situation evolves. For a summary of active wildfire evacuation notices, please visit EmergencyInfoBC.
Weather
An upper ridge continues to build over the province, extending the warming and drying trend that has been affecting the southern half of the province northwards. As a result, fuel indices in the north are expected to gradually rebound with sustained hot and dry conditions in the forecast.
The lightning risk today has been relatively low, but it is expected to increase in the coming days. Dry lightning remains a risk over the Kootenays and may also impact the southern coast by the end of tomorrow. Winds will be variable and terrain-driven, reaching 50-60 km/hr around convective cells.

Increased smoke expected on wildfires across the Northwest Fire Centre,1691042400,"
SMITHERS – Northwest Fire Centre forecasters are calling for warmer temperatures and lower relative humidity throughout the Fire Centre in the coming days. As a result, the public can expect to see increased smoke from wildfires in the Nadina Fire Zone and the Bulkley Fire Zone.
As temperatures increase and we experience a drying trend in these areas, fire activity is expected to increase on existing wildfires. Additionally, as forest fuels become more receptive to ignition, small-scale planned ignition projects on some incidents in the Nadina Fire Zone may be undertaken to remove unburned fuel in an intentional way and secure control lines.
Over the last several weeks, firefighters, officers, contractors, and support staff have been working diligently with support from our partners as well as aviation resources and multiple pieces of heavy equipment. Good progress has been made on many incidents as the downturn in weather bolstered the efforts of ground crews. Still other incidents are in steep or inaccessible terrain or lack safe or achievable objectives. These fires continue to be monitored and assessed for suppression opportunities.
None of the active wildfires are currently threatening communities or infrastructure, however the public should remain diligent and aware of wildfire activity as conditions may change as the summer progresses. The BC Wildfire Service continues to have Initial Attack Crews and aircraft positioned across the Northwest Fire Centre on standby to respond to any potential new incidents.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone. For up-to-date information on a current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, road closures and air quality advisories, download the BC Wildfire Service app or visit: www.bcwildfire.ca.

Area restriction in effect for Jubilee Mountain,1691042400,"
CASTLEGAR – The BC Wildfire Service has implemented an Area Restriction Order for the vicinity of the Jubilee Mountain wildfire (N22370), which originated approximately 18 kilometres southeast of Parson. This area restriction reflects the need to protect the public in areas where fire suppression activities are taking place.
This restriction is currently in effect and will remain in effect until 12 p.m. (PDT) on October 15, 2023, or until rescinded. The order applies to Crown land within the geographic boundaries described below:
From the Junction of Giant Mine Road and Spillmacheen River at [50° 54.252′-116° 24.380′] head southwest along the Spillmacheen River to junction of Powerline & Spillmacheen River at [50° 55.615′, -116° 29.848‘ ]; Due NORTHWEST along powerline to one kilometre northeast of Mitten Lake Rec Site at [50° 58.386′, -116° 33.579′ ]; Due northeast to high water on Columbia River flood plain at [51° 0.255′, -116° 31.367‘ ]; Due southeast to connect with point of commencement at junction of Giant Mine Road & Spillmacheen River.
A map of the affected area is available online.
Under this Order and section 11(2) of the Wildfire Act, a person must not remain in or enter the restricted area without the prior written authorization of an official designated for the purposes of the Wildfire Act, unless the person:

First receives written authorization of an official designated for the purposes of the Wildfire Act, or
Enters the area only in the course of:

travelling to or from his or her principle residence that is not under an evacuation order;
using a highway as defined in the Transportation Act;
travelling as a person acting in an official capacity as defined in s.56 of the Wildfire Act; or
travelling for the purpose of supporting wildfire suppression or enforcement patrol activities.



The BC Wildfire Service reminds the public that although access to a private residence is permitted, the public must stay out of active fire areas. Public interference has a direct impact on the effectiveness of fire suppression activities and poses safety risks to both the public and responders who are working to contain the fire.
This Order is subject to and subordinate to any applicable evacuation orders made under the Emergency Program Act.
Failure to comply with Section 11 restricted area requirements may result in a violation ticket of $1,150.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information, please visit the bans and restrictions page on the BC Wildfire Service website.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.

Fires in Southeast Fire Centre more visible,1690956000,"


Hot, dry conditions coupled with winds have resulted in increased fire activity across the Southeast Fire Centre.
Thirty-one new fires have been detected since July 30, the majority of them suspected to be caused by lightning that moved through the region this past weekend.
Existing fires are also exhibiting more intense fire behaviour resulting in smoke plumes and, in some cases, visible flames. Fire growth is expected on some fires currently classified as Out of Control.
No structures or communities are threatened at this time. The BC Wildfire Service is monitoring and responding to fires across the Southeast Fire Centre.
Further details on several fires of interest in the Southeast Fire Centre are as follows:
The North Lodgepole Creek wildfire (N12363) is burning 24 kilometres southeast of Fernie and 45 kilometres south of Sparwood. The fire, detected July 31, is suspected to be lightning-caused. Air tankers completed a retardant line around the fire on July 31 and Aug. 1. Ground crews with support from helicopters continue to work to suppress the fire, which is estimated at eight hectares.
The Birchlands Creek wildfire (N42228), which originated 17 kilometres southeast of Golden, B.C., is experiencing heightened fire activity due to weather conditions. The fire is currently burning in steep, inoperable terrain approximately five kilometres north of Highway 95 and eight kilometres south of the Trans-Canada Highway. Smoke is highly visible from surrounding communities and roadways. No communities or structures are presently threatened. The BC Wildfire Service is monitoring this fire and has plans to respond as required when and where it’s safe to do so.
The Kamma Creek wildfire (N71918), which originated 37 kilometres southwest of Cranbrook, is displaying increased fire behaviour as a result of hot, dry temperatures and winds. Smoke may be highly visible from Cranbrook, Kimberley, Wycliffe and other communities in the area. The fire size is estimated at 290 hectares. It is burning in a remote area and not threatening any structures or communities at this time. The BC Wildfire Service continues to monitor this fire and will respond as needed.  
The Rugged Peak wildfire (N52396) was detected Tuesday afternoon approximately 16 kilometres southeast of Nakusp, B.C., and three kilometres south of Highway 6. Initial attack crews and aerial resources, including skimmers and helicopters, responded immediately. Firefighters continued to work on the fire throughout Wednesday. By afternoon, hot, dry conditions resulted in fire intensity increasing to a vigorous surface fire with torching or passive crown fire, forcing crews to pull back. Learn more about wildfire rank. Crews and aircraft continue to action the fire where possible Wednesday evening, when it was an estimated two hectares. Smoke may be visible from Nakusp, New Denver and surrounding communities, as well as to travellers on Highway 6. 
The Jubilee Mountain wildfire (N22370) was detected on July 31 approximately five kilometres southwest of Harrogate and 10 kilometres northwest of Spillimacheen on the west side of the Columbia River. Initial attack crews supported by aircraft responded immediately with heavy equipment arriving later that afternoon. Since then, firefighters, heavy equipment and aircraft have continued suppression efforts. The fire is now estimated at 120 hectares.

Reminder to keep airspace clear for firefighting,1690783200,"


Any time a wildfire starts, the airspace surrounding the fire is automatically considered flight restricted as per Section 601.15 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations, to protect the safety and ability of pilots to be able to respond to the fire as needed. This restriction applies to any non-firefighting aircraft, including but not limited to private planes, gliders, drones and recreational air-sports such as hang-gliders and paragliders.
On some incidents, an Air Operations Branch Director works closely with Transport Canada to modify the automatic boundaries of the restricted airspace to ensure that impacts to others are limited, if possible, while also ensuring that operational safety is prioritized. This modified airspace is known as a formal NOTAM and information of all formal NOTAMs can be found at: https://plan.navcanada.ca/wxrecall/
The top priority during any wildfire response is the safety of first responders and the public. This means that the airspace used by wildfire response aircraft is explicitly prohibited to any other users, to limit any interference with flight paths and to allow aircraft to focus on their objectives to support wildfire suppression. Even small wildfires can be the centre of intense aviation activity.
Helicopters and airtankers are a vital part of any wildfire response in British Columbia and are being used regularly on fires across the province. Aviation resources are mainly used to support the work of ground crews, by providing water delivery support, transporting crews and gear and completing patrols to assess the severity of fire behaviour, among other uses.
When an incursion into a restricted airspace occurs, firefighting aircraft may need to be grounded while the airspace is secured, or flight paths may be impacted, slowing down response time and effectiveness of water or retardant delivery.
We want to remind the public that the operation of any aircraft not associated with fire suppression activities within this area, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones), is illegal. Anyone found interfering with wildfire control efforts (including flying drones or UAVs) can face penalties up to $100,000 and/or up to one year in jail.
Out of respect for the lives and safety of those responding to wildfires and in the interest of public safety, British Columbians are asked to keep their drones and all recreational aircraft well away from wildfires.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 31, 2023",1690783200,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,523 wildfires have burned over 1.54 million hectares of land in B.C. Wildfire activity in the northern regions of the province have stabilized, whereas southern regions continue to build hazard with persistent warming and drying.
Evacuation orders and alerts remain in effect in response to the Eagle Bluff – formerly Lone Pine Creek – wildfire (K52318), which crossed the USA border on the evening of July 29. Otherwise, there have been multiple amendments to evacuations in the province since last week’s update. For a summary of active wildfire evacuation notices, please visit EmergencyInfoBC.
Over 750 wildfire personnel from out-of-country and 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel are deployed within B.C. This international support is augmenting more than 2,000 BC Wildfire Service staff and 1,500 contract personnel (about 600 of which are contract firefighters) already responding to the wildfire situation in B.C.
Weather
Hot and dry weather continues to impact the Thompson-Okanagan and Kootenay regions. Some areas in the south are exhibiting crossover conditions, when relative humidity is less than or equal to the ambient air temperature, which can be an indicator of extreme burning conditions. 
The northern third of the province continues to receive rain, but by mid week some warming and drying will be begin to extend northward, which could cause the dampened fire danger to rebound if this pattern persists.

Campfire Prohibition remains in Prince George Fire Centre jurisdiction,1690696800,"
PRINCE GEORGE – Upon further review and with the ongoing wildfire activity within the Province, the B.C. Wildfire Service has made the determination that the complete Open Burning Prohibition including Category 1 Open Burning (campfires) issued on June 8, 2023 at 12 p.m. (PDT) will remain in effect.
Category 1, 2 and 3 open burning prohibitions will remain in place throughout the Prince George Fire Centre. This prohibition will remain in effect until 12 p.m. (PDT) on Sunday, October 15, 2023 or until it is rescinded. Prohibitions apply to all public and private lands unless otherwise specified (e.g. in an enactment or local government bylaw). A map outlining the prohibition areas is below.
In addition to the above noted open fire prohibitions, the following activities remain prohibited:

Fireworks
Sky Lanterns
Burn Barrels or Burn Cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Air Curtain Burners
Chimineas
Tiki and similar kinds of torches


Please check the BC Wildfire Service Bans and Restrictions webpage for the most current prohibitions for your area.
Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused wildfires.
Multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement an open fire prohibition, including: current and forecasted weather conditions; the availability of firefighting resources; and the Buildup Index (BUI).
The BUI rating is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape. It takes into account the fuel’s moisture content, since that can affect fire intensity.
Campfire and Open-burning prohibitions are implemented based on the particular region’s BUI values. The BUI allows the province’s six fire centres to follow a consistent and scientific process for evaluating the need for campfire prohibitions.
Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may issue a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 an/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

Area Restriction for Nation River rescinded,1690696800,"
PRINCE GEORGE – The Area Restriction that was established around the Nation River Wildfire (G60853) will be rescinded effective as of 12 p.m. (PDT) on July 30, 2023.
With the reduced fire activity and behaviour from recent rain, there is no longer a need to restrict public access in order for firefighting personnel to operate efficiently and safely in the area. This Nation River wildfire remains out of control at this time and BC Wildfire Service is continuing to respond to the incident.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public and industry that the Nation River wildfire is still an active wildfire and caution should be exercised at all times while travelling or working in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have authority under the Wildfire Act and the Wildfire Regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the BC Wildfire Service’s Bans and Restriction Page.
Residents and travellers within the vicinity of these fires may continue to see smoke from within the perimeter and burned material; however, smoke that rises from green, unburnt fuel or from outside the perimeter should be reported immediately.
To report a wildfire or an open burning violation, call *5555 on a cell phone or 1-800-663-5555 toll-free. Reporting is also available through the BC Wildfire Service mobile app.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 27, 2023",1690437600,"
Wildfire activity has stabilized over the past week due in part to dampened fuel indices in the north. There are currently 391 active wildfires in B.C., just over half of which remain Out of Control.
There have been multiple rescinds or downgrades of evacuation alerts and orders in response to wildfires in B.C. For a summary of active wildfire evacuation notices, please visit EmergencyInfoBC.
Nearly 800 personnel from out-of-country are deployed within B.C., and more are expected in the coming days and weeks. This international support is augmenting more than 2,000 BC Wildfire Service staff and 600 contract firefighters already responding to the wildfire situation in B.C. 
Weather
Accumulated rainfall has decreased the wildfire risk in the northern half of the province. Hazard continues to build in the south, primarily affecting the Cariboo, Thompson-Okanagan and Kootenay regions. 
Cool and humid conditions are expected across the middle of the province today, bringing a lightning risk to the Chilcotin on the east side of the Coastal Mountains. Most lightning cells will be accompanied by some precipitation.
The north will begin warming and drying tomorrow, but the hazard will remain in the south due to dry, receptive fuels and a risk of of dry lightning over the weekend.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 24, 2023",1690178400,"
There are currently 481 wildfires burning across the province, and 23 of those fires are wildfires of note. Over the weekend, fires in the Kamloops Fire Centre had significant growth. The Ross Moore Lake wildfire (K22024), which is approximately 24 kilometres south of Kamloops is now 2,600 hectares in size. In the Southeast Fire Centre good progress was made on the St. Mary’s River wildfire (N11805) on Sunday, this fire is now 4,093 hectares in size. Firefighting efforts in the northern regions of the province received some reprieve due to lower temperatures and some precipitation. On Sunday, successful planned ignitions were carried out on the Donnie Creek wildfire (G80280), where crews burned an area of approximately 4 kilometres to solidify containment lines. 
Over the weekend, we welcomed 102 additional wildfire fighters from Brazil. They will be supporting firefighting efforts in the Cariboo Fire Centre. The current firefighting effort across our province consists of approximately 600 out-of-country resources, and over 2,000 BCWS staff members. We are very grateful for all the support from local community contractors, including heavy equipment operators, first aid attendants, food suppliers and many others.
Weather
This weekend, weather remained significantly hot and dry in the southern regions of the province. The Northern regions received some precipitation but it was not substantial enough to negate drought conditions. Significant lightning was received over the weekend, 39,260 lightning strikes were recorded in B.C. since Friday.
Moving forward we are seeing the same trend of warm and dry conditions in the southern regions of the province with no precipitation anticipated in the near future. A significant concern will be overnight recoveries and crossover conditions, where the relative humidity of an area falls below the temperature of an area. We are expecting some windy conditions in the coming days and some rain for the northwest regions of the province.

Planned ignitions used to eliminate fuel



An effective tactic to control an advancing fire is to “burn-off” fuel between the fire’s edge and control lines. Burn operations are coordinated by skilled and experienced firefighters and risk is mitigated with careful planning using fire weather information.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 20, 2023",1689832800,"
There are currently 379 active wildfires in B.C., over half of which remain Out of Control, 85 per cent of the new fires in the last 72 hours have been started by lightning. Current conditions remain hot an dry in the southern regions of the province and as a result we are seeing more fire activity in the Southeast and Kamloops Fire Centres. New wildfires of note in these fire centres, the St.Mary’s River and Casper Creek wildfires have resulted in the implementation of Evacuation Orders and Alerts. 
We are extremely grateful for the additional international and federal support that arrived this week to support current staff working on wildfire suppression efforts. New Incident Management Teams (IMTs) from the United States and Australia have been established to support the Cariboo and Prince George Fire Centres where a combined total of 200 fires are currently burning. A total of 150 Canadian Armed Forces personnel arrived to the Prince George Fire Centre this week, these personnel will work alongside firefighters on the firelines to help bring wildfires in the area under control.  
Weather
A warm drying trend that started on Wednesday is forecast to continue through the weekend resulting in extreme dry conditions for most of the province. The most southern regions of the province will remain dry over the weekend and maximum temperatures will peak. This may further promote extreme fire behaviour in these regions. There is a chance of fair amounts of precipitation in parts of the northeast in the coming days.

So far this wildfire season, more than 1.4 million hectares of land have burned in B.C. The record-breaking scale of this season’s area burnt so far is primarily the result of some very large fires burning in the Prince George Fire Centre in B.C.’s northeast. For example, in the Vanderhoof Fort St. James (VanJam) area, heavy equipment and operational partnerships have been imperative to the success of response so far this fire season.

Hear from quipment Branch Directors Bruce Raby and Shane Derhousoff.
Operating side-by-side with BC Wildfire firefighters, heavy equipment is primarily engaged to build guards that support or make use of existing fuel breaks, including roads and natural features (such as rivers), to minimise additional damage to the natural environment. The regional knowledge and expertise brought by local contractors and First Nations helps BCWS crews to make informed choices about how to create the most effective guard while making the smallest impact possible to ecosystems.
Heavy equipment is set up to run both day and night in support of BC Wildfire crews. Guards are created in such a way that they can be used by fire crews to implement direct or indirect fire attack strategies.

Fire activity in the Prince George, Cariboo and Northwest Fire Centres continues to challenge crews who are working hard to keep communities and critical infrastructure safe. The Incident Management Teams that were overseeing the Donnie Creek and Omineca complexes of fires are demobilizing as these incidents can now be managed directly by local fire zones. 
Additional Australian and American resources arrived in B.C. over the weekend and the federal government has pledged additional support from the Coast Guard and Canadian Armed Forces. These personnel will support the approximately 2,000 BCWS and more than 180 international resources currently in B.C. So far this year, more than 350 international personnel have assisted in B.C. We have a long history of working closely with our international and federal partners during difficult wildfire seasons and are grateful for their support. 
Weather 
Over the weekend we saw a decrease in temperatures because of the smoke cover, which helped with fire activity. We observed some precipitation accompanied by lightning this weekend but it was not substantial enough to combat the underlaying drought conditions across the province. 
There is a fair bit of precipitation possible today but this may be spotty in some regions, and we will see hot and dry conditions return by mid-week. The northern regions of the province may continue to experience some instability. The Cariboo and southern regions likely will not enjoy much additional precipitation.

Wildfire aviation and how airtankers are used

Aircraft play a key role in supporting work done by crews and respond to fires around the province when needed. Teams in the Vanderhoof/Fort St James Zone received the support of airtankers over the weekend.
On July 15 and 16, airtankers based in the City of Prince George responded to wildfires G50912 and G51411, dropping retardant along control lines built by heavy equipment on the ground. The use of retardant on both fires successfully reduced fire behaviour long enough that crews were able to return to their lines and continue to build guard around priority areas of the fire.

Area Restriction for Omineca Complex rescinded,1689487200,"
PRINCE GEORGE – The Area Restriction that was established around the Omineca Complex has been rescinded effective as of 12:00 p.m. (PDT) on July 16, 2023.
With the reduced fire activity and behaviour, there is no longer a need to restrict public or industry access in order for firefighting personnel to operate efficiently and safely in the area.
The rescind applies to the Area Restriction covering the Fall River (G50851), Big Creek (G60666), Thane Creek (G60882) and Mesalinka River (G60651) fires. The Area Restriction for the Nation River (G60853) wildfire remains in effect.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public and industry personnel that wildfires within the Omineca Complex remain active and continue to be active worksites. Caution should be exercised at all times while travelling or working in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have authority under the Wildfire Act and the Wildfire Regulation to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public and industry personnel should be aware that safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the BC Wildfire Service’s Bans and Restriction Page.
Residents, travelers and industry personnel within the vicinity of these fires may continue to see smoke from within the perimeter and burned material. However, smoke that rises from green, unburnt fuel or from outside the perimeter should be reported immediately.

Regional wildfire update for the Northwest Fire Centre and Prince George Fire Centre,1689228000,"
Today the BC Wildfire Service hosted a regional wildfire update to help provide timely and accurate information on the current wildfire situation in the Nadina, Bulkley-Nechako, Fort St. James and Vanderhoof regions of the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres.  
These areas have seen increased fire activity as a result of prolonged drought conditions and a convective weather pattern that has brought persistent thunderstorms to the region. In the last seven days B.C. has seen 51,000 lightning strikes, with 76% of those concentrated in the Northwest and Prince George Fire Centres. As a result, 399 new wildfires have started in the last week with 224 of those within the regions focused on today. Of the active fires currently burning in B.C., 198 were caused by lightning.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 13, 2023",1689228000,"
Since April 1, 2023, 1,042 wildfires have burned over 1.2 million hectares of land in B.C. There are currently 349 active wildfires, over half of which remain Out of Control.
All Fire Zones have seen significant lightning activity in the past week, leading to an increase in new fire starts. As conditions remain hot and dry in most regions, many of these new starts have quickly grown and exhibited extreme fire behaviour. The intensity of many of the current wildfires in B.C. is too high for direct attack methods, and smoke is interfering with aviation.
Additional Evacuation Orders and Alerts came into effect in the Northwest, Prince George and Cariboo Fire Centres. As fire activity continues to increase in the coming days, BC Wildfire Service will prioritize fires that may impact communities and critical infrastructure.
B.C. continues to work with the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) to bring in additional out-of-province resources, including an Incident Management Team, and advanced planning personnel from Australia. These additional resources will support the approximately 160 international personnel from Mexico and the United States currently deployed in B.C.
Weather
Today (Thursday, July 13) is likely to be the hottest day of the week, and the 12th consecutive day of widespread thunderstorms across northeastern B.C. The current convective pattern is forecast to remain in place due to low winds in the upper atmosphere. A dry air mass moving north is lowering the humidity, which will further increase fire behaviour. 
Tomorrow the pattern will begin to change with a warming trend moving into the in southeast pulling in cloud and heightening relative humidity. There is potential this for some precipitation in the northeast on Saturday and more forecast for Sunday.

Direct vs. Indirect attack explained,1689228000,"


Image: Parrot Lookout wildfire (R21234) taken on July 11, 2023.
In recent weeks, the Prince George, Northwest and Cariboo Fire Centres have been facing increased fire growth and activity. So far this year, 1.2 million hectares have burned provincewide, compared to a seasonal average of 76,008 hectares.
On the ground, these wildfires are demonstrating dangerous fire behaviour that requires swift and strategic response. For instance, on July 12 the Parrot Lookout wildfire (R21234) was displaying continuous crown fire with moderate to fast spread. Approximately 40 firefighters were assigned to the incident for direct attack but had to pull back to ensure crew safety.
But there are many ways to respond to a wildfire, and the first priority is always the safety of responders and the public. To understand why firefighting teams use the methods they do, watch this video about direct versus indirect attack.



In this video, Wildfire Technician Alec Milne explains the specifics of direct and indirect attacks during a wildfire response.
When possible, firefighters use a strategy called direct attack for wildfires that are low-intensity and pose minimal risk to firefighter safety. This involves setting up control lines adjacent to the fire. Firefighters, aircraft and heavy equipment work in close proximity with the wildfire’s perimeter to build these lines and extinguish flames. This approach is usually deployed for fires between ranks 1 and 3.

On the other hand, when wildfires are moderate-to-high intensity and unsafe for crews to work close by, fire crews may employ indirect attack. Instead of being next to the fire, control lines are established at a significant distance, often hundreds or thousands of metres away from the fire’s edge. This is a way of boxing in the fire and directing it to a safer area for personnel and equipment.
We are currently using indirect attack to respond to many wildfires across the province.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 10, 2023",1688968800,"
Since April 1, 2023, 904 wildfires have burned over 1.15 million hectares of land. There are over 300 active wildfires, nearly two thirds of which ignited this weekend. 
Between July 7 and 9, there were over 23,000 lightning strikes province-wide, sparking nearly 200 new wildfires and resulting in an additional 5,600 hectares burned. The majority of this activity occurred within the Prince George and Northwest Fire Centres. This lightning activity was compounded by ongoing drought conditions and high temperatures. Additional lightning-caused starts are expected in the week ahead.
Several evacuation alerts and orders came into effect over the weekend, primarily impacting communities in the Northwest, Prince George and Cariboo Fire Centres. Please visit Emergency Info BC for up-to-date evacuation information or refer directly to the regional districts, First Nations or other local governments issuing the alerts and orders.
All open burning, including campfires, is prohibited across the province (excluding Category 1 campfires in Haida Gwaii) as of July 10 at 3 p.m. (PDT).
International personnel from Mexico and the United States are currently deployed to northern regions in B.C., and the province has secured additional aviation resources in recent days. The BC Wildfire Service continues to coordinate additional out-of-province resources through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
Weather
Wildfire hazard continues to build with persistent hot, dry conditions and more lightning in the forecast. Due to a lack of wind in the upper atmosphere, parts of B.C. may experience a phenomenon known as “pulse thunderstorms” today, which will cause intense, localized storm cells to sit in place for prolonged periods. The lightning risk is highest for parts of the Northwest, Prince George, and Cariboo Fire Centres.
The current trend is forecast to stabilize by the end of the week, decreasing the risk of widespread thunderstorms. However, deep and persistent drought conditions remain.

How fuel conditions impact wildfire activity,1688882400,"
The summer months often bring significant lightning activity to B.C., and depending on fuel conditions, can ignite many wildfires within a relatively short period of time and across a large geographical area. Between July 7 and 9, there were over 23,000 lightning strikes across the province, sparking nearly 200 new wildfires and resulting in an additional 5,600 hectares burned. The majority of this activity occurred within the Prince George and Northwest Fire Centres.
Driftwood River wildfire (G50912) on July 4, 2023 by Silvie Fojtik 
Due to a combination of factors including an extended 2022 wildfire season, fall drought conditions, a dry winter and an anomalously warm 2023 spring season, the majority of B.C.’s forests are exceptionally dry and susceptible to ignition.
These hot and dry conditions have a big impact on wildfire activity, as fuel moisture content is a key factor in the fire weather index (FWI). The FWI is a tool used by fire behaviour specialists to predict how easily a wildfire will start, how quickly it will grow and how far it may spread.
In this video, Fire Behaviour Specialist, Ben Boghean, explains how his team assesses current and future moisture levels in fuels to help better predict fire behaviour. For example, coniferous trees respond to drought by producing more cones, which draws water out of their needles. That water is then replaced by resin, making fuels highly combustible.



Ongoing drought conditions this season have greatly impacted wildfire fuels, from grasses to trees. By determining these fuel moisture levels, the BC Wildfire Service can better predict how a fire will behave on the landscape and therefore prepare for potential impacts. That knowledge can be used to inform planning, logistics and other wildfire operations to keep firefighting personnel and communities safe this summer.

Area Restriction for South Peace Complex rescinded,1688623200,"
PRINCE GEORGE – The Area Restriction that was established around the South Peace Complex has been rescinded effective as of 12:00 p.m. (PDT) on July 6, 2023.
With the reduced fire activity and behaviour, both current and anticipated, there is no longer a need to restrict public access in order for firefighting personnel to operate efficiently and safely in the area. On July 2, 2023, the West Kiskatinaw River (G70645) wildfire was classified as Being Held and the Peavine Creek (G70644) wildfire was classified as Under Control.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public and industry that the West Kiskatinaw and Peavine Creek (G70644) wildfires are still active wildfires and caution should be exercised at all times while travelling or working in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have authority under the Wildfire Act and the Wildfire Regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Road closures and area restrictions are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the BC Wildfire Service’s Bans and Restriction Page.
Residents and travellers within the vicinity of these fires may continue to see smoke from within the perimeter and burned material; however, smoke that rises from green, unburnt fuel or from outside the perimeter should be reported immediately.
To report a wildfire or an open burning violation, call *5555 on a cell phone or 1-800-663-5555 toll-free. Reporting is also available through the BC Wildfire Service mobile app.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 6, 2023",1688623200,"
BC Wildfire Service crews continue to work hard to respond quickly to increased fire activity in many regions of the province. Of more than 80 new fires in the last seven days, fewer than 30 remain active, and only 16 remain out of control.
After an early beginning to the season that saw heightened fire behaviour in the northeast, activity remains intense. Lightning strikes in highly receptive fuels have caused many new starts in the Interior and Coastal regions of the province in recent days.
International resources are now supporting in the Prince George Fire Centre, with the arrival of 100 firefighters from Mexico. A further 60 people are coming from the United States to support response, including 20 highly certified single resources and 40 firefighters.
Nationally, fire activity remains high. Ontario and Quebec have benefitted from some recent precipitation, but resources remain stretched in both provinces.
Weather
There were just over 1,200 lightning strikes across the Prince George Fire Centre yesterday, causing some holdover fires. Some regions enjoyed precipitation alongside those strikes, but not enough to alleviate ongoing drought conditions.
Today will likely be the hottest day of the week for many regions of the province. An unstable northwesterly flow will pull cloud and instability down from the Yukon and North West Territories creating cloudy conditions throughout the Interior. The forecast shows more thunderstorms across much of the Interior with risk of lightning along the Coast and on Vancouver Island.
Tomorrow, a unique weather pattern known as a Rex block will hold the current thunderstorm risk in place, increasing temperatures and broadening the area of risk for lightning strikes. Smoke will move southeast into Alberta, creating more of a haze in the southern half of the province. Over the weekend, there is more lightning in the forecast and hazardous conditions will persist.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – July 4, 2023",1688450400,"
It was a busy long weekend for the BC Wildfire Service. Since Friday, teams from across the province responded to 46 new wildfire starts. Thanks to diligent reporting from the public and quick action of aviation and ground resources, 35 of these new fire starts are Out, Under Control, or Being Held. Of the 46 new wildfires from the weekend, 30 percent were human-caused.
The BC Wildfire Service would like to thank members of the public for their vigilance this long weekend. Over 1,000 reports of wildfire were received. 
The majority of activity over the last three days has been in the Prince George and Coastal fire centres. Cooler temperatures and precipitation decreased fire activity in some areas of the Prince George Fire Centre. 
Nationally, the wildfire situation remains very active with over 3,300 wildfires started so far this year, concentrated in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and B.C. International crews are supporting efforts across Canada, and B.C. is coordinating additional out-of-province resources through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
Weather
B.C. can expect more of the same warm and dry conditions this week. A ridge of high pressure is settling over the province, which will continue to dry forest fuels, particularly in the Interior and Vancouver Island. On Wednesday, the risk of lightning increases over parts of Vancouver Island and eastern B.C. 
Over the next few days, smoke from wildfires in B.C. and Alberta will spread across the province. This is expected to dissipate later in the week.

Public urged to use caution when extinguishing campfires,1688104800,"
SMITHERS – In advance of the long weekend, the Northwest Fire Centre (NWFC) is urging the public to use extreme caution around campfires.
While a Category 1 campfire prohibition remains in effect across the Nadina Fire Zone, there is not currently a Category 1 campfire prohibition in the Bulkley, Skeena, or Cassiar Fire Zones.
A campfire is considered any fire smaller than 0.5 metres high by 0.5 metres wide, used for recreational purposes or ceremonial purposes for a First Nation person.
Given the warm and dry conditions in the NWFC over the past few weeks and forecasted warm and dry conditions next week, it is essential that anyone having a campfire in the Bulkley, Skeena or Cassiar Fire Zones be responsible and follow regulations.
These include:

maintaining at least eight litres of water on hand at all times when a campfire is lit;
not having a campfire when it is windy;
choosing a proper fire pit or making a ring of rocks at least three metres from trees, shrubs, structures and debris, and;
not leaving a campfire unattended for any amount of time.

Furthermore, anyone having a campfire must ensure that it is fully extinguished and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area. Extinguish your fire by stirring water into the embers until they feel cold to the touch. Hot coals can reignite a fire, especially in warm weather.
Anyone who leaves a campfire unattended for any length of time may be fined up to $1,150, while anyone whose campfire causes a wildfire may also be subject to a penalty of up to $100,000 if convicted in court, and/or sentenced to one year in jail, along with any costs associated with fighting the fire and damages.
A province-wide prohibition on Category 2 and 3 open burning remains in effect for the entire Northwest Fire Centre, which includes fires larger 0.5 metres by 0.5 metres. Please view restrictions specific to your region on the BC Wildfire Service website.
Always check with local government authorities for any other restrictions before lighting any fire. To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open fire violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.

High winds expected across the Cariboo,1688104800,"
WILLIAMS LAKE- High winds are forecast throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre this weekend with gusts up to 50-60 kilometres per hour. Members of the public are reminded to be vigilant when recreating in the outdoors. Campfires must not be left unattended for any length of time and must be fully extinguished, and cold to the touch, before leaving the area.
This spring has seen unseasonably windy, dry and hot conditions that have resulted in 74 fires with a total of 2870 hectares burned within the Cariboo region, with the majority being human caused.
Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert firefighting resources away from naturally occurring wildfires in the region.
The current prohibitions do not ban campfires or cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes within The Cariboo Fire Centre. A reminder to the public about campfire safety and responsibilities are as follows:

No larger than 0.5 metres high by 0.5 metres wide
Must have a fire guard around the campfire
Must have ready access to 8 litres of water or a shovel for the entire time the campfire is lit
Never leave the campfire unattended
The ashes of a campfire must be cool to the touch before leaving the area

A reminder that currently, there are Category 2 and Category 3 prohibitions in place throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre including the Tsilhqot’in (Xeni Gwet’in) Declared Title Area. As well the following activities and use of the following equipment, materials and substances are currently prohibited:

Fireworks
Sky Lanterns
Burn Barrels or Burn Cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Air Curtain Banners
Chimineas

Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.
Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from naturally caused fires. Always practice safe, responsible open fire use.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 29, 2023",1688018400,"
Heading into a warm, dry and windy Canada Day long weekend, the BC Wildfire Service asks the public to exercise caution as the risk for new wildfires increases. 
Thunderstorms and lightning occurred throughout the week in many areas across the province, increasing the possibility of undetected lightning-caused wildfires. Windy, dry conditions could cause some of these to flare up. Since April 1, 2023, 566 wildfires have burned over 960,000 hectares of land. One hundred of those fires are still active. 
Campfire prohibitions and new area restrictions have been implemented this week. Please be aware of any bans and restrictions in your area by visiting the BC Wildfire Service website and checking with local authorities. 
Nationally, there are 501 active wildfires with a total of 3,038 this year having burned 8.1 million hectares of land. The majority of wildfires have been in Quebec and B.C. International crews are supporting efforts across Canada, and B.C. is coordinating additional out-of-province resources through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
Weather
Thunderstorms are expected today and tomorrow, bringing potential for hail, localized downpours and strong, gusty winds along the Rockies, extending as far north as Fort Nelson. Smoky, cloudy conditions up north may help decrease current fire activity.
Over the weekend, very windy conditions are expected for the Central and Southern Interior, which may increase existing fire activity. A chance of showers along the mid-coast and northeast may reach the Donnie Creek wildfire come Sunday. However, conditions are expected to remain warm, dry and windy for most of the province.

Area Restriction in effect for vicinity of Nation Lakes Area,1687932000,"
PRINCE GEORGE – The BC Wildfire Service is implementing an Area Restriction Order for the vicinity of the Nation Lakes wildfires (G60861, G50872), located approximately 90km north of Fort St. James and 100 km west of the town of Mackenzie. The size of the area restriction reflects the continued need to protect the public in areas where there are ongoing fire suppression activities and hazardous fire behaviour conditions.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 26, 2023",1687759200,"
Following thundershowers and lightning over the weekend we are monitoring several areas of the province for lightning-caused fire starts. Since April 1, 2023, 521 wildfires have burned 919,665 hectares of land across the province, the majority of that being the Donnie Creek wildfire (574,511 hectares), north of Fort St. John.
The Prince George Fire Centre continues to see elevated wildfire activity. The area is being monitored for fire starts from lightning strikes that occurred over the weekend.
Nationally, fire conditions remain challenging, particularly in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. International crews have deployed to support response efforts across the country. B.C. is working closely with the Canadian Interagency Fire Fighting Centre (CIFFC) as discussions around additional out-of-province resources continue. 
Weather
This weekend brought over 12,000 lightning strikes to the province, with the majority striking in the Prince George Fire Centre. While the northern part of B.C. is expected to cool down a bit this week, overall warm and dry conditions persist. 
Tuesday and Wednesday, continued showers and a risk of thundershowers are expected, with a risk of lightning, particularly over the northwestern and southern parts of the province. Southwesterly winds are forecasted to pick up through northern regions of B.C. later in the week as temperatures cool temporarily.   No significant precipitation is forecast for the weekend.

Category 1 campfire prohibition remains in effect for the Nadina Fire Zone,1687413600,"
BURNS LAKE – The Category 1 campfire prohibition remains in effect across the Nadina Fire Zone, which includes Tweedsmuir Park and the Nadina Forest District. The Nadina Fire Zone extends from Babine Lake (in the north) to Tweedsmuir Park (in the south) and from Endako (in the east) to Hungry Hill (in the west). This prohibition came into effect June 8, 2023 and will remain in place until September 30, 2023, at 12 noon (PDT) or until the public is otherwise notified.
The Category 1 campfire prohibition applies to all BC Parks, Crown lands and private lands, within the Nadina Fire Zone unless specified otherwise in an enactment (e.g., in a local government bylaw). Always check with local government authorities for any other restrictions before lighting any fire.
Please view a map of the affected areas online: here.
This campfire prohibition does not include the Bulkley, Skeena or Cassiar Fire Zones; however, the prohibition on Category 2 and 3 open burning remains in effect for the entire Northwest Fire Centre. Please view restrictions specific to your region: here.
For more information on Category 2 & 3 open burning please click: here.
In addition to the Category 1 campfire prohibition the following activities and equipment are also prohibited within the Nadina Fire Zone:

Fireworks

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 22, 2023",1687413600,"
After a week of decreased fire behaviour due to cool, wet conditions, the BC Wildfire Service is preparing for a potential uptick this weekend, particularly in the northern half of the province. We’re mobilizing resources to be prepared for potential activity in the north.
A U.S. Incident Management Team has arrived to manage the West Kiskatinaw Fire (G70645) in the Prince George Fire Centre. B.C. is also welcoming two hotshot crews and smokejumpers (paraattack) from the U.S. to support response. These resources will allow for local crews to recover and prepare for the season ahead. 
Nationally, fire conditions remain intense, particularly in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. International crews have deployed to support response efforts across the country. B.C. is working closely with the Canadian Interagency Fire Fighting Centre (CIFFC) as discussions around additional out-of-province resources continue. 
Weather
While precipitation across the southern half of B.C. has helped to dampen risk, dryness persists, particularly in the Cariboo and southern Northwest Fire Centres and on Vancouver Island. Instability in the northeastern corner of the province could bring scattered showers with the potential for dry lightning, spurred by high winds.
Tomorrow the risk of lightning will expand to include the South Coast with increased risk through the North Peace and southward along the Rocky Mountains. Higher winds and increasing temperatures will support dryer conditions across the province as we move into the weekend.

Coastal Fire Centre partial rescind of Campfire Prohibition,1687240800,"
PARKSVILLE – Effective at noon Pacific Daylight Time on Wednesday, June 21, 2023, Category 1 fires (campfires) will once again be permitted in the Sea to Sky Resource District, Sunshine Coast Resource District, the Chilliwack Resource District, and the portion of the Central Coast Regional District that falls within the North Island Central Coast Resource District. Campfires will continue to be permitted in the Haida Gwaii Resource District. This change will be implemented due to cooler conditions and rainfall, which has reduced the fire danger rating in these areas. However, if conditions change, prohibitions may once again be enacted.
Campfires will remain prohibited on Vancouver Island and most Gulf Islands – along with tiki and similar kind of torches and chimineas — until October 31, 2023, or until the order is rescinded.
Category 2 and Category 3 fires will remain prohibited throughout the Coastal Fire Centre, and effective at noon Pacific Daylight Time on Wednesday, June 21, 2023, this will also include the Haida Gwaii Resource District. This prohibition is being enacted to help prevent human-caused wildfires and protect public safety and will be in place until Tuesday, October 31, 2023, or until the order is rescinded.
The Category 2 and Category 3 prohibition also restricts the following activities and equipment:

Fireworks
Sky Lanterns
Burn Barrels or Burn Cages of any size or description
Binary Exploding Targets
Air curtain burners

The use of outdoor stoves is not prohibited. As per the Wildfire Regulation, an outdoor stove is a CSA-rated or ULC-rated device used outdoors for cooking, heat or ambiance that burns charcoal briquettes, liquid fuel or gaseous fuel, and has a flame height that is less than 15 cm tall.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 19, 2023",1687154400,"
So far in 2023, 871,573 hectares have burned in B.C., compared to a 10-year average of 21,734 hectares. The Donnie Creek Complex (G80280) of fires, currently burning in the northeast corner of B.C., is responsible for 534,388 hectares, making it the largest fire, by area, in B.C.’s history. Donnie Creek continues to burn in highly volatile boreal spruce fuel types that have experienced prolonged drought conditions. It is not unusual to see large fires in this fuel type as it is a fire-adapted ecosystem.  
While these numbers are staggering, there are other important factors to consider when comparing seasons such as impacts to structures, lives, cultural values, ecological values, property and infrastructure, and industry. 
Resources from the United States are arriving in B.C. to support efforts in the Prince George Fire Centre, which will provide respite for our staff for the long season forecasted ahead. This includes an Incident Management Team, hotshots and smoke jumpers.   
Weather
Despite a cooling trend and the arrival of some localized precipitation over the weekend, the impacts of fall drought and a dry spring continue to impact fire behaviour. These elevated drought conditions will persist until significant and prolonged precipitation is observed.
Today, the southern half of the province can expect precipitation and cooler temperatures, while warmer temperatures are beginning to return in the north. Winds will ease overnight with localized gustiness along the Rockies, with some lightning risk in the Northwest.
Tomorrow should see warmer temperatures in the north with patches of sun and cloud. Cloudy showers continue to move across the Southern Interior and Southeast where temperatures will remain cool. Winds will remain light with occasional gustiness in the northeast corner of the Province. More precipitation is anticipated across the Southeast and Kamloops Fire Centres with lightning risk in the central north.

Understanding the 2023 wildfire season so far,1687154400,"
Since April 1, 2023, 457 wildfires have burned 869,861 hectares in British Columbia. The 20-year average for this time of year is 16,218 hectares. 
Across Canada, 5,792,184 hectares have burned since Apr 1. The national 10-year average for this time of year is 369,266 hectares.  
The amount of hectares burned this season is significant, drawing comparisons to previous, devastating wildfire seasons. However, there are key factors that have caused more hectares to burn this season as well as other things to consider when comparing severe seasons. 
Highest seasonal hectares burned in B.C. since 1950:
Fire Year Hectares Burned 2018 1,354,284 2017 1,216,053 2021869,3001958 855,968 1961 483,097 2014 368,786 1971 351,342 1982 348,695 1950 343,339 2010 337,149 1985 312,757 
Donnie Creek wildfire
The Donnie Creek wildfire on June 4, 2023. 
The Donnie Creek wildfire, burning in the northeasten corner of the province accounts for 534,388 of these hectares, or 62 per cent of the total area burned so far this season.  
On June 18, 2023, the Donnie Creek wildfire became the largest recorded wildfire in British Columbia’s history, excluding past wildfire complexes.
It was detected on May 12, 2023, and was caused by lightning. 
This fire has grown due to natural growth as well as combining with six smaller lightning-caused fires which is adding to its size.

G80582 (Bubbles Creek)
G80590 (Heck Creek)
G80633 (Holman Creek)
G80287 (West Conroy Creek)
G80315 (Hockey Creek)
G80274 (Katah Creek)

Conditions contributing to growth 
The Donnie Creek wildfire is burning in highly volatile boreal spruce fuel types, in a sparsely populated region that has experienced prolonged drought conditions. 

Drought code as of June 18, 2023
Boreal forests are fire-adapted ecosystems and this is a natural process. It is not uncommon for boreal forest types to experience fires of this size in the spring, and they are especially fire-prone during the prolonged drought conditions we are currently experiencing, which contribute to advanced fuel drying. 



Throughout May, temperatures were consistently above seasonal averages, with daily temperatures ranging three to 10 degrees higher than normal. The amount of rain received was also considerably lower than historical norms, with some areas receiving half of their average amount of precipitation. Sixteen of 23 Environment Canada weather stations recorded the warmest May on record. Nineteen of 23 Environment Canada weather stations recorded a drier than normal May. 
The Peace River Regional District, highlighted in red. 

Managing large wildfires
When wildfires become this large, wildfire response shifts to a management approach. 
Managing a fire of this size means a focus on suppression activities around communities and critical infrastructure and monitoring the fire where these values are not at risk.  
We expect the Donnie Creek wildfire will continue to burn into the fall, with possible extinguishment in the winter. Even with snow and winter rains, there is potential for fires to holdover and continue to smoulder through the winter months, and emerge the following spring.  This usually occurs when there is a thick layer of duff, which is made up of decaying needles, leaves and woody debris. These fuels allow for very slow, smouldering conditions that can linger through winter, re-emerging in the spring. 


Learn about the Duff Moisture Code

Is 2023 the worst season on record? 
While many hectares have burned so far this year, area burned is just one tool to measure the impact of a wildfire or wildfire season. 
There are other important factors to consider when comparing seasons such as impacts to structures, lives, cultural values, ecological values, property and infrastructure, local economies, tourism and industry.   
While wildfires are significant and challenging events to anyone impacted, as of June 19, approximately 10 properties are under an evacuation order because of the Donnie Creek wildfire. While it is challenging to quantify the human toll of challenging wildfire seasons, it’s important to note that hectares burned does not tell the whole story. 

What is the future of the season? 
Typically, the number and severity of wildfires in July and August depends on the amount of rain received in June. Despite a temporary cooling trend, Environment Climate Change Canada is indicating a high probability of above-normal temperatures throughout the summer. It is unlikely the amount of rainfall forecast for the second half of June will be sufficient to alleviate the elevated drought conditions that have persisted since last fall. 

Warmer-than-normal temperatures typically result in accelerated drying conditions and increase the risk of ignition from both lightning and humans in starting and sustaining wildland fires. Until significant and prolonged precipitation is observed, fuels will continue to dry, resulting in deep burning and challenging firefighting conditions. The number of new wildfire starts will increase as we move through June and into July and August, the two months that typically see the most lightning activity. Overall, an early and more active start to the core wildfire season is anticipated.

Open Burning 101 – Category 1 Campfires,1686981600,"
Many British Columbians enjoy campfires (also known as Category 1 Open Fire) during the summer months, and fire is often used for Indigenous cultural and ceremonial purposes. Every year nearly half of all wildfires are human caused, and a some of those are the result of unattended or irresponsible campfires.
In the first half of June, BC experienced record-breaking warm and dry conditions, significantly increasing the risk of accidental human-caused wildfire. That’s why the BC Wildfire Service enacted a Category 1 campfire prohibition for many parts of the province on Thursday, June 8, 2023. A recent return to more seasonal conditions allowed for those prohibitions to be rescinded in the Kamloops and Cariboo Fire Centres on June 16, 2023.
The decision to enact or rescind a prohibition is carefully considered based on several factors. Watch the video below to learn more about how wildfire experts make decisions about prohibitions:


Nearly half of all wildfires in B.C. are caused by human activity. Though campfires only represent a portion of human-caused wildfires, prohibitions are another tool used to reduce the likelihood of more human caused fires when conditions are dangerous. 
Category 1 campfire is defined as:

Any fire no larger than 0.5 metres high by 0.5 metres wide (a fire larger than this is considered a Category 2 open fire).
Used by any person for recreational purposes or for Indigenous cultural or ceremonial purposes.

Category 1 campfire prohibitions
British Columbia is a large and geographically diverse province. For that reason, decisions on when and where to implement fire bans and restrictions are made by B.C.’s six regional fire centres.
Multiple factors are considered when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement or rescind an open fire prohibition, including:

Current and forecasted weather conditions
Current wildfire activity
The availability of firefighting resources
Fire weather indices, including the Buildup Index (BUI)
Public events

The Buildup Index, or BUI, represents the total amount of fuel available to burn on the landscape, and considers moisture content and the overall effects of seasonal drought. Campfire bans are typically enforced when over 50% of the weather stations within a defined geographic area surpass the BUI threshold established for that area. BUI thresholds vary throughout the province.
The threshold for a given area is based in part on the area’s assigned fuel type. Different fuel types respond differently to fire, and fire behaviour experts use that information to determine how volatile a region may be, how intensely and deeply a potential fire will burn, and how difficult it might be to suppress that fire.
Learn more about BUI, fuel types and other fire weather indices.
Safety and responsibility
In areas where campfires are not prohibited, there are lots of things you can do to limit risk and enjoy campfires responsibly. Follow these essential steps before, during and after having a campfire:

Check with local governments and other authorities (e.g., BC Parks) to see if any burning restrictions or bylaws are in effect.
Choose a proper fire pit or make a ring of rocks at least three metres from trees, shrubs, structures and debris.
Always have at least eight litres of water or a hand tool available while your campfire is lit.
Do not leave a campfire unattended for ANY amount of time.
Before you leave the area for any amount of time, your campfi­re MUST be fully extinguished. The ashes of your fi­re must be cool to the touch.

Anyone found in contravention of an open fire prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs. Violators could also be held responsible for damages to Crown resources, which could be significant.
Reporting
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open fire violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.
Did you know you can now report a wildfire using our BC Wildfire Service mobile app? Use the “Report a Fire” function to submit an electronic report and upload a photo. You must have data or a WiFi connection to submit a report.

Category 2 open burn prohibition rescinded in the southeast,1686808800,"
CASTLEGAR – Effective at noon (PDT) on Friday, June 16, 2023, Category 2 open burning prohibition will be rescinded throughout the Southeast Fire Centre’s jurisdiction.
Due to decreased wildfire risk, the following activities will once again be permitted throughout the Southeast Fire Centre:

one to two concurrently burning piles no larger than two metres high by three metres wide
burning stubble or grass over an area less than 0.2 hectares
the use of fireworks
the use of exploding binary targets
the use of air curtain burners
the use of sky lanterns, and
the use of burn barrels or burn cages

Category 3 open fires, as defined in the Wildfire Regulation, remain prohibited throughout the Southeast Fire Centre until October 28, 2023 or the public is otherwise notified.A map of areas affected by the Category 3 open fire prohibition is available here.
Residents are reminded to take the following precautions with any Category 2 open burning:

Never leave a fire unattended.
Follow the Open Burning Smoke Control Regulation: http://ow.ly/9LnG50L1fjf
Check the local venting index. Venting index information is available by calling 1 888 281-2992 or visiting: http://ow.ly/5MHN50L15iu.
At least one person equipped with a firefighting hand tool must monitor the fire at all times.
Never burn in windy conditions. Wind may carry embers to other combustible material and start new fires.
Create a fire guard around the planned fire site by clearing away twigs, grass, leaves and other combustible material right down to the soil.
Make sure that your fire is fully extinguished and the ashes are cold to the touch before you leave the area for any length of time.

Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $100,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to up to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs, as well as the value of the resources damaged or destroyed by the wildfire.
These prohibitions apply to all public and private land within the Southeast Fire Centre jurisdiction, unless specified otherwise in an enactment (e.g., in a local government bylaw). Always check with local government authorities to see if any other burning restrictions are in effect.
The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to Mica Dam in the north, and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the west, to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east.
The BC Wildfire Service thanks the public for its continued support and co-operation during the fire season. To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 15, 2023",1686808800,"
After an early start to the 2023 wildfire season, cooler temperatures and rain have helped to reduce current fire activity in some parts of the province. As wetter weather has dampened the fire danger in some regions, fire centres are currently reassessing their current prohibitions. Learn more about what goes into campfire prohibitions.
There have been 442 fires since April 1, 2023, with 66 starting in the last seven days and 12 in the last 24 hours. To prepare for the season ahead and provide respite for BC Wildfire Service staff, one Incident Management Team will be imported from the United States this weekend. As conditions evolve, discussions will continue with our international partners on further support as needed.
Weather:
This week many regions of the province saw cooler temperatures and precipitation that brought a smattering of dry lightning in the northeastern corner of the province, particularly running along the Rocky Mountains.
Increased windiness is anticipated across the province today, driving lingering smoke east towards Alberta by the end of the week. West and southwesterly winds will gust through the Peace throughout the day. Cloud cover and showers will move into the North Island and Mid Coast this afternoon and temperatures will begin to climb, particularly in the Southern Interior.
Despite recent precipitation, the long-term drying trend that has driven extreme fire behaviour so far this season is forecasted to linger and overnight recoveries will continue to struggle. Widespread instability on Friday may see lightning impact the Eastern Cariboo and most of the Prince George Fire Centre.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 12, 2023",1686549600,"
Over the weekend, rain and cooler temperatures affected southern regions or the province, temporarily lowering fire behaviour. Wildfire activity was quick to rebound, however, once conditions cleared and temperatures returned to at least a few degrees above seasonal. The majority of wildfire activity remains concentrated in the northeast region of the province, where 99 per cent of the total area burned so far this season has occurred. 
Weather: 
After a temporary downturn in weather over the weekend, temperatures rose to 4-7 degrees above normal today. Hot and dry conditions are expected to favour the Cariboo, Bulkley and Lillooet Fire Zone in the short term. A chance of ongoing thunderstorms in the southeast corner of the province is expected to linger. Due to current fuel conditions in this region, the probability of lightning-caused starts is low. This probability will increase as this weather system shifts north. Come tomorrow, cooler and wetter conditions are forecast to reach the Interior and stretch north into reach the South Peace Region but stop before reaching Fort Nelson. High, gusty winds are expected to accompany this weather event, which could affect fire behaviour and growth of existing fires.

West Kiskatinaw River (G70645)
Peavine Creek (G70644)
Cameron Bluffs (V70600)
Chehalis River (V10588)

Of the current Wildfires of Note, three remain of particular interest. Over the past 24 hours, the Donnie Creek wildfire (G80280) grew by several thousand hectares to the south due to high winds and dry, receptive fuels. In response to this growth, evacuation alerts and orders issued by the Peace River Regional District have been expanded. Structure protection remains mobilized in response to the West Kiskatinaw River wildfire (G70645). Airtankers reinforced containment lines this afternoon by dropping retardant. There has been no growth observed towards Tumbler Ridge since Friday, June 9. The Cameron Bluffs wildfire (V70600) continues to burn in very steep, unstable terrain above Highway 4, which remains closed due to the risk of falling debris. The BC Wildfire Service is working with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) and other agency partners to mitigate hazards along the highway corridor.

Wildfire activity in B.C. continues to build as hot, dry conditions persist causing forest fuels to be highly susceptible to ignition. More than 80 new wildfires have sparked over the past week, and 11 have been detected in the last 24 hours. 
As of 12 p.m. (PDT) today, Category 1 open fires (campfires) are prohibited in many areas of the province. Visit bcwildfire.ca for details.
The Prince George Fire Centre experienced significant lightning over the weekend, followed by a period of heavy winds. These conditions have resulted in extreme fire behaviour across the northeast. Evacuation orders have been recently implemented in response to the West Kiskatinaw River (G70645) wildfire, located within the Dawson Creek Fire Zone. Please refer to EmergencyInfoBC for the most up-to-date evacuation information. 
The Cameron Bluffs (V70600) wildfire, located near Cameron Lake on Vancouver Island, continues to impact Highway 4. Please visit DriveBC for updates on road and highway closures.
Weather 
Thursday, June 8, is forecast to be the hottest day of the current heatwave. Into the evening, lightning is expected to touch down in the southeast, accompanied by only trace amounts of precipitation.
On Friday, subtropical moisture will begin to drift across the southern third of the province, increasing the chance of cooler temperatures and showers as well as thunderstorms and gusting winds.
Heavy smoke continues to impact the northeast, bringing high levels of fine particulate matter to the Peace Region. Some smoke clearing and improved visibility is expected over the weekend as a result of shifting winds and the subtropical airmass.

Area restriction in effect for vicinity of Donnie Creek Complex,1686204000,"
FORT ST. JOHN – The BC Wildfire Service has implemented an Area Restriction Order for the vicinity of the Donnie Creek Complex of fires (G80280, G80590, G90273), located approximately 158 kilometres north of Fort St. John and 136 kilometres southeast of Fort Nelson. The size of the area restriction reflects the continued need to protect the public in areas where there are ongoing fire suppression activities and hazardous fire behaviour conditions.
This order takes effect at 12 p.m. (PDT) on June 8, 2023, and will remain in force until September 30, 2023, or until it is rescinded. The order applies to crown land within the geographic boundary outlined below and shown on the provided map.

Summer 2023 Seasonal Outlook,1686204000,"
Spring summary
Since April 1, 2023, nearly 400 wildfires have burned more than 512,000 hectares in B.C. Ninety-nine per cent of this fire activity has occurred in the northeast regions of the Prince George Fire Centre. This area exceeds the total amount of hectares burned across the province in 16 of the last 20 fire seasons.
Throughout May, temperatures were consistently above seasonal averages, with daily temperatures ranging three to 10 degrees higher than normal. The amount of rain received was also considerably lower than historical norms, some areas receiving half of their average amount of precipitation.
Recent burning conditions
Under persistently dry conditions, wildfires will spread rapidly upon ignition when accompanied by strong winds, increasing the potential for wildfires to grow to a substantial size.

Donnie Creek wildfire – May 26, 2023
The lightning-caused Donnie Creek wildfire (G80280) was discovered on May 12, 136 km southeast of Fort Nelson. Between May 19 and 21, the fire received 40 mm of rain. In subsequent days, temperatures increased, and the wildfire saw significant growth in the span of five days. The Donnie Creek wildfire is the second largest wildfire ever recorded in B.C.
Summer wildfire outlook
Typically, the number and severity of wildfires in July and August depends on the amount of rain received in June. Current models predict the current drying and warming trend will continue through the first half of June. Despite a temporary cooling trend after this weekend, Environment Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is indicating a high probability of above-normal temperatures throughout the summer. It is unlikely the amount of rainfall forecast for the second half of June will be sufficient to alleviate the elevated drought conditions that have persisted since last fall. Until significant and prolonged precipitation is observed, fuels will continue to dry, resulting in deep burning and challenging firefighting conditions. The number of new wildfire starts will increase as we move through June and into July, the two months which typically see the most lightning activity. Overall, an early and more active start to the core wildfire season is anticipated. 
Beyond June, the longer-range forecast suggests that temperatures will remain above seasonal through the remainder of the summer. Warmer-than-normal temperatures typically result in accelerated drying conditions and increase the risk of ignition from both lightning and humans in starting and sustaining wildland fires.
Fire behaviour indices
The build up index (BUI) is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available to ignite and burn on the landscape. It considers the moisture content within the middle and deeper organic layers, which directly affects fire intensity.



The BUI anomaly charts below represent two scenarios: on the left are forecast BUI anomalies should normal June rainfalls materialize, which currently seem unlikely. On the right is the dry scenario without significant rainfall by June 30. In both cases, elevated buildup indices are likely to persist heading into the core of the fire season. 
Elevated BUI is consistent with fires that burn hotter and deeper, which can often challenge containment, especially during widespread or large-scale lightning events.

Partial Category 1 campfire prohibition planned for the Northwest Fire Centre,1686031200,"
SMITHERS – Effective at 12:00 (noon) Pacific Daylight Time on Thursday, June 8, 2023, Category 1 campfires will be prohibited across the Nadina Fire Zone, which includes the Nadina Forest District.
This campfire prohibition will prevent human-caused wildfires and protect public safety.
The province-wide prohibition on Category 2 and 3 open burning remains in effect. Please view restrictions specific to your region here: http://ow.ly/mwjh50OH9qI
For more information on Category 2 & 3 open burning please click Here.
Specifically, prohibited activities that would constitute a Category 1 campfire include:

Fireworks
Sky lanterns
Burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Tiki and similar kinds of torches
Chimineas
Air curtain burners

This prohibition does not include the use of outdoor stoves. As per the Wildfire Regulation, an outdoor stove is a CSA-rated or ULC-rated device used outdoors for cooking, heat or ambiance that burns charcoal briquettes, liquid fuel or gaseous fuel, and has a flame height that is less than 15 cm tall.
Anyone conducting a Category 1 campfire anywhere in the Nadina Fire Zone must extinguish any such fire by 12:00 (noon) PDT, June 8, 2023. This prohibition will remain in place until September 30, 2023, at 12 noon (PDT) or until the public is otherwise notified.
Please view a map of the affected areas online: https://ow.ly/AaCv50OIxY7
The Category 1 campfire prohibition applies to all BC Parks, Crown lands and private lands, but does not apply within the boundaries of a local government that has forest fire prevention
bylaws in place and is serviced by a fire department. Check with local government authorities
for any other restrictions before lighting any fire.
Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused fires. Always practice safe, responsible fire use where permitted.
Check with your local government or other jurisdictional authorities before lighting a fire of any size since they may have their own restrictions in place.
Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone.

Multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement an open fire prohibition, including: current and forecasted weather conditions; the availability of firefighting resources; and the Buildup Index (BUI).
The BUI rating is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape. It takes into account the fuel’s moisture content, since that can affect fire intensity.
Campfire prohibitions are implemented based on the particular region’s BUI values. The BUI allows the province’s six fire centres to follow a consistent and scientific process for evaluating the need for campfire prohibitions.
Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused wildfires.

Smoke visible in Quesnel Lake area,1685944800,"
There are currently five active wildfires in the Central Cariboo Horsefly Zone. Four of these wildfires are classified as Out of Control. Smoke from these fires may be visible in the areas of Quesnel Lake, Horsefly, Likely and 150 Mile.
The four Out-of-Control fires are monitor only. A monitor-only fire is a modified response fire that is being analyzed but is not receiving immediate suppression action and may be allowed to burn to achieve ecological or resource management objectives. All four of these fires are being monitored routinely by experienced officers, none of them are threatening structures or communities at this time.
Fire C30573 is classified as a modified response and is now considered to be Under Control. This means that it is being managed using a combination of suppression techniques to steer, contain or otherwise manage fire activity within a pre-determined perimeter.
Public and media are encouraged to monitor:

The BC Wildfire Service public map for local fire conditions,
The B.C. Air Quality website for current advisories and smoke forecasts,
The FireSmoke Canada website for current smoke conditions,
The DriveBC website for current road conditions and closures or delays due to visibility and/or wildfire, and

High winds forecast across the Cariboo,1685599200,"
WILLIAMS LAKE – High winds are forecast throughout the Cariboo with gusts up to 45 kilometres. Industry partners and members of the public are reminded to be vigilant and we recommend returning to check any burn piles or stacks that have been previously extinguished. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert firefighting resources away from naturally occurring wildfires in the region.
This spring has seen unseasonably windy, dry and hot conditions that have resulted in 58 fires with a total of 1,797 hectares burned within the Cariboo region, with the majority being human caused.
A reminder that there are Category 2 and Category 3 prohibitions in place throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre including the Tsilhqot’in (Xeni Gwet’in) Declared Title Area. The following activities and use of the following equipment, materials and substances are also prohibited:

Fireworks
Sky lanterns
Burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Air curtain banners

The current prohibitions do not ban campfires or cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes within the Cariboo Fire Centre. A reminder to the public on campfire safety and responsibilities:

No larger than 0.5 metres high by 0.5 metres wide
Must have a fire guard around the campfire
Must have ready access to 8 litres of water or a shovel for the entire time the campfire is lit
Never leave the campfire unattended
Must be completely extinguished and ashes cool to the touch before leaving the area

Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – June 1, 2023",1685599200,"
After a brief respite, conditions across the province are beginning to warm, and temperatures will continue to rise over the weekend. Despite green-up, drought-like conditions persist and there is little precipitation in the forecast. There have been six new fires in the last 24 hours, and Donnie Creek (G80280) remains the only fire of note in the province.
Wildfire activity across Canada is increasing, with 1,802 fires across the country so far this year. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) is now at a preparedness level of five with persistent challenges in Alberta and new starts in Nova Scotia.
Alberta continues to require international resources, including crews from the United States, Australia and South Africa. BC Wildfire Service continues to support and is deploying one Incident Management Team and two unit crews.
Weather 
Today, temperatures remain seasonal but are trending warm and dry with the potential for isolated lightning in the southeast. Gusting winds will blow along the east side of the Rocky Mountains into the central/northeast regions. Overnight recoveries continue to struggle in the northeast as conditions remain dry.
Tomorrow, the upper ridge over the Prairies will continue to build, bringing a clearing trend and a southeasterly wind into the northeast. There will be increased risk of lightning throughout the eastern side of the province, through the Cariboo and into the North Thompson. Temperatures in the southeastern/central regions of the province will rise, and the drying trend seen throughout the province will continue.

Please check the BC Wildfire Service Bans and Restrictions webpage for the most current prohibitions for your area.
Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused wildfires.
Multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement an open fire prohibition, including: current and forecasted weather conditions; the availability of firefighting resources; and the Buildup Index (BUI).
The BUI rating is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape. It takes into account the fuel’s moisture content, since that can affect fire intensity.
Campfire prohibitions are implemented based on the particular region’s BUI values. The BUI allows the province’s six fire centres to follow a consistent and scientific process for evaluating the need for campfire prohibitions.
Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may issue a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 an/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

Prescribed burn planned in the Mineral Creek area,1685426400,"
Castlegar – The BC Wildfire Service will be supporting Interfor in conducting a hazard abatement prescribed burn in the Mineral Creek area. The Mineral Creek prescribed burn will cover up to nine hectares and is located approximately 10 kilometres northeast of the community of Burton.
Smoke may impact the residents closest to the burn area and be visible from Burton and Nakusp. It may also be visible from Fauquier and Needles, as well as motorists travelling along Highway 6.
The exact timing of this burn will depend on weather and site conditions but could begin as early as Wednesday, May 31, 2023. Burning will proceed if conditions are suitable and allow for smoke dispersal, though smoke may linger in the days following the burn.
Key goals of both prescribed burns include:

long-term fire hazard abatement by reducing fuel loading
preparing the site for replanting
increase long-term nutrient cycling and biodiversity
contribute to landscape level fuel break and wildfire mitigation efforts

Fire is a normal and natural process in many of B.C.’s ecosystems. The BC Wildfire Service works regularly with land managers to undertake fuel management activities (including the use of prescribed burns), to help achieve land management objectives, reduce the severity of future wildfires and increase ecosystem and wildfire resilience.

Area Restriction for the Teare Creek Wildfire (G30210) rescinded,1685340000,"
ROBSON VALLEY – The Area Restriction that was established around the Teare Creek wildfire (G30210) has been rescinded effective as of 12:00 p.m. (PDT) on May 29, 2023.
With the reduced fire activity and behaviour, both current and anticipated, there is no longer a need to restrict public access in order for firefighting personnel to operate efficiently and safely in the area. The Teare Creek wildfire was classified as Under Control on May 24, 2023.
The BC Wildfire Service reminds members of the public and industry that the Teare Creek wildfire is still an active wildfire and caution should be exercised at all times while travelling or working in the area. Even if an area restriction has been rescinded, officials still have authority under the Wildfire Act and the Wildfire Regulations to order anyone to leave the area.
Before entering any area affected by a wildfire, members of the public should be aware that significant safety hazards may be present. Trees that have been damaged by fire might be unstable and could fall. Ash pits can be hard to detect and can remain hot long after the flames have died down.
Road closures and area restriction are subject to change depending on fire activity. For the most current information please visit the BC Wildfire Service’s Bans and Restriction Page.
Residents of the Village of McBride may continue to see smoke from within the perimeter and burned material; however, smoke that rises from green, unburnt fuel or from outside the perimeter should be reported immediately.
To report a wildfire or an open burning violation, call *5555 on a cell phone or 1-800-663-5555 toll-free. Reporting is also available through the BC Wildfire Service mobile app.

"Be prepared, help prevent wildfires this long weekend",1684476000,"
VICTORIA – Residents, travellers and campers are strongly urged to use caution and remain vigilant to prevent human-caused fires when enjoying the outdoors this weekend.
Above-normal temperatures, combined with drought conditions throughout most of the province, are increasing the potential for wildfires. People should be prepared for wildfire and heat, have an emergency plan and stay informed as conditions change.
Since April 1, 2023, more than 220 wildfires have burned more than 135-thousand hectares, largely within the Prince George Fire Centre. Of these fires, 85% were human-caused and were preventable. Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility.
Category 2 and 3 open burning fires are now prohibited across the most of the province. Campfires (known as Category 1) are prohibited throughout the Prince George Fire Centre as of noon on Friday, May 19, 2023. For information specific to your region, visit: Fire Bans and Restrictions
Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for 1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined as much as $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.
While the majority of wildfires that occur in the spring are typically human-caused, with the return to more seasonal conditions, there is an increasing probability of lightning-caused fires. The BC Wildfire Service is closely monitoring these changing conditions and making preparations with strategic aviation and crew placements.
To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone or download the BC Wildfire Service app. The mobile app allows individuals to submit photos along with their report which helps inform BC Wildfire Service operational decision-making.
Stay informed as conditions change by visiting www.BCwildfire.ca or through the BC Wildfire Service app.
Campfires:

While campfires are currently allowed in most areas of the province that fall under the BC Wildfire Service’s jurisdiction, individuals should check with local governments and other authorities (e.g., BC Parks) to see if any burning restrictions or bylaws are in effect.
Keep campfires no larger than 0.5 metres high or 0.5 metres wide.
Never light a campfire or keep it burning in windy conditions. Weather can change quickly and wind may carry embers to other combustible material.
Never leave a campfire unattended.
Have a shovel or at least eight litres of water available to properly extinguish a campfire.
Make sure the ashes are cool to the touch before leaving the area.

Additional precautions:

Anyone riding an all-terrain vehicle on or within 300 metres of forested land or rangeland must have a spark arrestor installed on the vehicle.
To help reduce wildfire risks, check the condition of the muffler, regularly clear buildups of grass or other vegetation from hot spots, stay on dirt paths and avoid tall grass and weeds.
Dispose of smoking materials responsibly, ensuring they are completely extinguished.

FireSmart tips for property owners/renters:

Remove branches, leaves, pine needles and other combustible material from roof, gutters, balconies, doorways, windowsills, etc. Pay particular attention to corners or other tight spots where debris tends to gather.
Mow any grass within 10 metres of your home regularly, preferably to a height of 10 centimetres or less.
If you have a deck with a crawlspace beneath it, clear combustibles from there.
Create a 1.5-metre non-combustible zone around buildings by raking and/or sweeping down to mineral soil, rock or concrete.
Any movable propane tank or wood pile should be kept at least 10 metres away from your home.
Check all exterior vents to make sure they are properly screened and in good condition.
Learn more about FireSmart: https://firesmartbc.ca/

Heat warnings:

Monitor Environment and Climate Change Canada for updates about heat warnings and temperature forecasts in your region.
During heat events, the Province works with health authorities, First Nations and local authorities to protect people and communities, and helps fund cooling centres.
First Nations and local authorities in affected areas will open cooling centres to the public if needed. Check with your municipality, regional district or First Nation for the most up-to-date information.

Preparing for and responding to hot weather:

If you have air conditioning at home, make sure it is in good working order.
If you do not have air conditioning at home:

Find somewhere you can cool off on hot days.
Consider places in your community to spend time indoors, such as libraries, community centres, movie theatres or malls.
Temperatures may be hotter inside than outside, so consider outdoor spaces with plenty of shade and running water.
Shut windows and close curtains and blinds during the heat of the day to block the sun and prevent hotter outdoor air from coming inside. Open doors and windows when it is cooler outside to move that cooler air indoors.
Ensure that you have a working fan, but do not rely on fans as your primary means of cooling. Fans can be used to draw cooler in late evening, overnight and early-morning air indoors.
Keep track of indoor temperatures using a thermostat or thermometer. Sustained indoor temperatures hotter than 31 C can be dangerous for people who are susceptible to heat.
If your home gets very hot, consider staying with a friend or relative who has air conditioning if possible.
Identify people who may be at high risk of heat-related illness. If possible, help them prepare for heat and plan to check in on them. The most susceptible individuals include adults over 60, people with pre-existing health conditions, people with mental illnesses and people with disabilities.



Health:

Drink plenty of water and other liquids to stay hydrated, even if you are not thirsty.
Spray your body with water, wear a damp shirt, take a cool shower or bath, or sit with part of your body in water to cool down.
Take it easy, especially during the hottest hours of the day.
Stay in the shade and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher.
Take immediate action to cool down if you are overheating. Signs of overheating include feeling unwell, headache and dizziness. Overheating can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
Signs of heat exhaustion include heavy sweating, severe headache, muscle cramps, extreme thirst and dark urine. If you are experiencing these symptoms, you should seek a cooler environment, drink plenty of water, rest and use water to cool your body.
Signs of heat stroke include loss of consciousness, disorientation, confusion and severe nausea or vomiting. Heat stroke is a medical emergency.
In the event of a medical emergency, call 911. However, it is important to use 911 responsibly to avoid overwhelming the system.
Never leave children alone in a parked car. Temperatures can rise to 52 C within 20 minutes inside a vehicle when the outside temperature is 34 C. Leaving the car windows slightly open will not keep the inside of the vehicle at a safe temperature.
Heat affects pets. Never leave a pet in a parked car. Limit pets’ exercise, and be sure to provide them with plenty of water and shade.

Travel:

Destination BC’s Know Before You Go is a regularly updated, one-stop shop for visitors looking to access key information resources, including DriveBC, the BC Wildfire Service and Emergency Management BC.
It is important to recognize that British Columbia is a large and diverse province. Many areas are not directly affected and are open for business.
If the area you were planning to travel to is affected by wildfires or under an evacuation alert or order, connect with a local visitor centre to rebook your trip to another area of the province.
The River Forecast Centre asks that anyone planning activities on rivers or waterways check any advisories for high streamflow or other concerns.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – May 18, 2023",1684389600,"
Exceptional summer-like conditions have accelerated the drying of fuels and have made some regions highly susceptible to ignition and rapid spread. To date, the most significant wildfire activity has been concentrated to the northeast region of the province, and the vast majority of ignitions have been attributed to human activity. 
The BC Wildfire Service has continued to support EMCR and CIFFC with freshet response and out-of-province deployments. Resources currently deployed to Alberta will be returning next week; and we will be looking at how we can best support our partners by assessing current capacity and forecast conditions.
Weather
Thursday afternoon, scattered thunderstorms are forecast across the Central and Southern Interior along with moderate winds and occasional gusts reaching up to 60 km/hr. The amount of rainfall accompanying these thunderstorms will be highly variable and therefore difficult to predict. Given the province-wide hot and dry conditions, lightning ignited wildfires are possible, particularly below the snow-covered peaks and ridges. This potential for lightning ignition is forecast to extend northwards into the northern Interior and along the foothills of the Northern Rockies on Friday and persist into the weekend. A transition to a cooler and wetter pattern is forecast beginning Sunday.

Category 2 & Category 3 open fire prohibited across Northwest Fire Centre,1684389600,"
SMITHERS – Effective at 12:00 (noon) Pacific Daylight Time on Thursday, May 18, 2023, Category 2 and Category 3 open fires will be prohibited across the entire Northwest Fire Centre. Category 2 and Category 3 open fires were already prohibited in the Bulkley and Nadina Fire Zones, and this prohibition is now being extended to the Skeena and Cassiar Fire Zones.
The BC Wildfire Service is implementing this prohibition to help prevent wildfires caused by Category 2 and 3 open burning and to protect public safety.
This prohibition will remain in place until June 15th, 2023, or until the public is otherwise notified.
Specifically, this prohibition refers to the following activities:
Category 2 open fires:

material in 1 or 2 piles not exceeding 2-metres in height and 3-metres in width,
material concurrently burning in 2 piles each not exceeding 2-metres in height and 3-metres in width, or
stubble or grass burning over an area that does not exceed 0.2 hectares.

This prohibition will remain in effect until 12 p.m. (noon) on Sunday, October 15, 2023 or until it is otherwise rescinded. Prohibitions apply to all public and private lands unless otherwise specified (e.g. in an enactment or local government bylaw). A map outlining the area affected by this prohibition is available online and below.
In addition to prohibiting the use of open fire of any size, the following activities and apparatus are also prohibited:

Tiki and/or similar kinds of torches
Chimineas
Outdoor stoves or other portable campfire apparatus without a CSA or ULC rating
Fireworks
Sky lanterns
Burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description
Binary exploding targets
Air curtain burners

During campfire prohibitions, only CSA-rated or ULC-rated outdoor stoves or portable campfire apparatus that use gas, propane or briquettes may be used; however, when conditions warrant, the use of portable campfire apparatus or outdoor stoves may be further restricted or prohibited. Please check our website for current prohibitions in your area.

If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

The B.C. government recognizes that camping is a long-standing tradition in this province and that people enjoy having campfires, so it takes any decision to implement a campfire ban very seriously.
Multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement an open fire prohibition, including: 

Current and forecasted weather conditions;
The availability of firefighting resources, and 
The Buildup Index (BUI).

The BUI rating is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape. It takes into account the fuel’s moisture content, since that can affect fire intensity. Campfire prohibitions are implemented based on the particular region’s BUI values. The BUI allows B.C.’s six fire centres to follow a consistent and scientific process for evaluating the need for campfire prohibitions.

Wildfire Community Preparedness Day (WCPD) 2023,1683957600,"
Wildfire Community Preparedness Day (WCPD) is a national campaign that encourages communities and organizations to come together on the first Saturday of May to take action to raise awareness and reduce wildfire risks. This year, WCPD is May 6, 2023.
The purpose for this day is to increase a community’s resiliency to wildfire, primarily by reducing the fuel on homeowners’ property. The exercise of planning, organizing and carrying out this kind of work helps raise awareness among the general population, especially people who live on or near the wildland-urban interface. Working together to protect shared interests can help forge stronger bonds within a community, which can be of enormous value, before, during and after an emergency.
WCPD was started by FireSmart™ Canada in 2015 and communities from all over the country have participated to raise awareness and increase wildfire resiliency. Neighbourhoods and communities from all over Canada can apply for a $500 grant to be applied to FireSmart practices to increase wildfire resiliency. For the past three years, B.C. communities have received the most grants in Canada and 118 grants were awarded for the 2023 season.



WCPD is a national program by FireSmart™ Canada that encourages everyone to increase resilience to wildfire for their homes, neighbourhoods, and communities. Located in the Columbia Valley, Castlerock Estates in Invermere is an example of an active, progressive FireSmart BC Community. Castlerock was officially recognized in 2017 and has conducted multiple projects around their community over the years to continue building wildfire resiliency. Watch the video and read the blog to learn more about Wildfire Community Preparedness Day and how the community of Invermere B.C. is recognized as leaders in community wildfire preparedness.
Ideas for neighbourhood activities: 

Rake and remove pine needles, dry leaves and combustible debris from within 1.5 metres of neighbourhood homes. As time permits, continue up to a 10-metre distance around each home.
Grab a measuring tape and see how close wood piles are located to homes. Woodpiles must be at least 10 metres from structures.
Clear leaves, needles and debris from roofs and gutters.
Sweep porches and decks clearing them of leaves, pine needles, and combustible matter. Rake under decks, porches, sheds and play structures, and dispose of debris.
On mature trees, use hand pruners and loppers to remove low-hanging branches up to two metres from the ground (be careful not to remove more than one-third of the branches).
Collect downed tree branches and take them to a disposal site.
Move items under decks and porches to garages, basements, or sheds that are enclosed with screened vents (maximum three millimetre screening) to prevent ember intrusion.
Screen or box-in areas below decks with wire screening (no larger than three millimetres) to help keep embers out during a fire.
Work with neighbours to assess homes and properties using the FireSmart Begins at Home app.
Help each other perform recommended activities or simple, cost-free renovations.
Pool neighbourhood resources to pay for a chipper service to remove slash.
Spend the day with neighbours building or updating 72-hour emergency kits for each household.
Work with neighbours to ensure that the addresses of all homes in the neighbourhood are visible from the street.
Help neighbours with mobility challenges FireSmart their homes.
Locate two routes out of your neighbourhood (besides the one normally used), and plan and practice an evacuation drill. Review the FireSmart Canada evaluation checklist with neighbours.
Work with local emergency management authorities to develop and practice a neighbourhood evacuation plan.
Work with neighbours to develop a phone or text tree to alert everyone about a fire or evacuation.
Invite a horticulturist to review the FireSmart Guide to Landscaping with you and your neighbours and suggest which types of FireSmart plants might work best in your neighbourhood.
Identify and remove high flammability plants (junipers and cedars) from within 1.5 metres of neighbourhood homes.
Host a BBQ and invite your Local FireSmart Representative to run a FireSmart workshop to learn about the Neighbourhood Recognition Program and FireSmart principles.

Important dates/Timeline:
The WCPD application period will reopen late fall 2023 and close January 31, 2024.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – May 11, 2023",1683784800,"


The BC Wildfire Service continues to respond to elevated fire activity in the northeast corner of the province. In addition, the organization remains on standby for flood support operations and has deployed a 16-person incident management team and several structure protection resources to Alberta. 
An unseasonably strong ridge of high pressure will build over British Columbia beginning Friday and persist through the weekend. This will mean summer-like conditions with temperatures forecast to be several degrees above seasonal normals, likely breaking temperature records for mid-May.
Watch BC Wildfire Service Superintendent of Predictive Services, Neal McLoughlin provide an update on what this weather will mean for wildfire conditions across the province, including areas of particular concern in the northeast.



Weather forecast
The upper ridge starts to gain momentum today with temperatures pushing upward through all areas with relative humidity values falling. Light and variable winds in most areas with occasional gustiness, and convective potential moving east, could see clusters of storms in the Peace region.
Daytime maximum temperatures are expected to reach into the low to mid 30s over the Southern Interior while highs across the Central and Northern Interior will approach the high 20s or low 30s. 
The ridge is forecast to persist well into next week delivering several consecutive days of hot, dry weather. While there remains uncertainty with the eventual dissipation of the ridge, current forecast models are indicating a shift to a cooler and more unsettled pattern near the end of next week, around Thursday May 18.

The next Provincial Wildfire Status Update will be provided on May 18, 2023.

Fuel types in northeastern B.C.
Bryan Bowman is the Fire Behaviour Specialist on the Incident Management Team that is currently based out of Fort St. John, responding to the North Peace complex. The complex consists of the Boundary Lake (G80220), Red Creek (G80223) and Cameron River (G80175) wildfires.
Located in the northeastern part of the province, the fuel types in the area range from stands of Black Spruce, to mixed coniferous and deciduous stands, as well as large areas of blow-down and agricultural lands.
In this video, Bryan talks about the fuel types on the Red Creek wildfire which is located approximately 32 kilometres northwest of Fort St. John, and discusses the conditions on site and how fire behaves in these fuel types. He also highlights the challenges of working in these fuel types, including the risks it poses to response personnel and the potential effects that the forecasted warming and drying trend and potential increase in windspeeds could have on the rates of spread and fire behaviour when combined with the fuel types on the Red Creek wildfire.



BC Wildfire Service Flood Support
The BC Wildfire Service is being increasingly called upon to support communities with hazard response outside of wildfire. Members of the Sentinel unit crew were deployed to support with flood response in Grand Forks last week. BC Wildfire Service crews were also supporting similar operations in Cache Creek, Lumby, Midway, Lower Nicola and Salmo.
Learn more about what flood support looks like on the ground in this brief video.

Prescribed burn planned for the Sutherland Creek area,1683612000,"
CASTLEGAR – The BC Wildfire Service, Southeast Fire Centre, will be supporting Interfor to conduct a prescribed burn covering up to 44 hectares in the Sutherland Creek area, 10 kilometres east of Christina Lake.
Smoke may impact residents down valley of the burn and may be visible from Christina Lake and surrounding areas, and to motorists travelling along Highway 3.
The exact timing of this burn will depend on weather and site conditions, but it could begin as early as Thursday, May 11. Burning will only proceed if conditions are suitable and allow for good smoke dispersal during operations. However, smoke may linger onsite for several days following the burn while crews conduct mop-up and patrol.
Key goals of this prescribed burn include:

reducing forest fuels to decrease the long-term risk of wildfires,
helping to restore forest health and a properly functioning ecosystem,
preparing the site for replanting, and
returning a natural and necessary process to the landbase.

Fire is a normal and natural process in many of B.C.’s ecosystems. The BC Wildfire Service works regularly with land managers to undertake fuel management activities (including the use of prescribed burns), to help achieve land management objectives, reduce the severity of future wildfires and improve ecosystem and wildfire resilience.

Changes to B.C. Wildfire Regulation,1683612000,"
Amendments to the B.C. Wildfire Regulation, a regulation under the Wildfire Act, were approved by the Province of British Columbia on April 24, 2023.
The changes clarify responsibilities related to high-risk activities and open fire use within provincial jurisdictions and help prevent human-caused wildfires. Category 1 campfires and category 4 resource management open fire have been renamed to match the existing wording in the Wildfire Regulation (there are no changes to the definition or size of any of these open fires).
A definition of an outdoor stove has been added to the Regulation. An outdoor stove is a CSA-rated or ULC-rated device used outdoors for cooking, heat or ambiance that burns charcoal briquettes, liquid fuel or gaseous fuel, and has a flame height that is less than 15 cm tall.
Some obligations of people using open fire have been clarified. For example, where a fuel break must be placed and where an open fire must not spread from. For category 3 open fire, which includes larger-scale pile burning, a new requirement has been added to document actions taken to confirm that these open fires are extinguished.
The Wildfire Regulation has also been amended to clarify that an open fire must remain in control at all times even if the fire is still within a fuel break. If a fire becomes out of control – regardless of whether the fire is within or outside of the fuel break – the person must carry out fire control immediately and extinguish and report the fire.
The duties related to fire watchers, which are sometimes required after high risk activities occur, have been clarified to better describe when a fire watch needs to begin, and to ensure that fire watchers may detect and respond to fires during the fire watch period.
First Nations woodland licences are now included in the definition of a qualified holder. These licences have the same rights and obligations as other tenure types included in the definition of a qualified holder. The implication of being a qualified holder is that the timelines for completing fire hazard assessment and abatement are more flexible than for a non-qualified holder. In addition, there are different requirements for fuel breaks for qualified holders when using category 3 open fires for hazard abatement within a cut block.
You can read the Fact Sheet here for some common questions about the changes.

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – May 8, 2023",1683525600,"
There are currently 62 active wildfires in the province. Of these 62 active incidents, 91% are under control or being held. Only five active incidents remain out of control. While all six regional fire centres are experiencing wildfire activity, the majority of active fires, and all current wildfires of note, are in the Prince George Fire Centre. 
Alberta is current experiencing catastrophic wildfire activity. A 16-person BC Wildfire Service Incident Management Team has been deployed to Alberta to assist with response efforts. Structure protection crews, a structure protection specialist and structure protection units have also been deployed. 
In addition to wildfire response in B.C. and Alberta, the BC Wildfire Service is also supporting flood response in the southern interior and Grand Forks area.



Summary
Weather forecast
We are expecting cloudy skies and scattered showers across much of the province today. Throughout the week, we will see gradual warming and drying affecting all regions except the northwest and northern areas of the coast. 
Currently, there is a risk of thunderstorms currently the southeast. This is expected to elongate towards the northwest as the week progresses. Temperatures expected to trend significantly above seasonal by the end of the week/weekend.

Fire bans and prohibitions 
B.C. is a large and geographically diverse province. For that reason, decisions on when and where to implement fire prohibitions are made by B.C.’s six regional fire centres. In deciding to implement a prohibition, they consider:

level of fire activity
fire danger ratings
current and forecasted fire weather indices
long-range weather forecasts
short term (3-day to 5-day) weather forecasts
the possibility of lightning in geographically specific areas
risk of human-caused fires
fuel types
fuel volatility

The process for determining fire risk is complex and may differ from one part of the province to another, depending on local conditions.
Additionally, multiple factors are taken into consideration when assessing wildfire hazards and deciding whether to implement an open fire prohibition, including current and forecasted weather conditions; the availability of firefighting resources; and the Buildup Index (BUI).
The BUI rating is an estimate of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape. It considers the fuel’s moisture content since that can affect fire intensity. Campfire prohibitions are implemented based on the region’s BUI values. (Previously, campfire bans were date-driven or based on Fire Danger Ratings, depending on the fire centre.)
A campfire ban will be enacted when over 50% of the weather stations within a defined geographic area surpass the BUI threshold established for that area. BUI thresholds vary throughout the province. The threshold for a particular area is based in part on the area’s assigned “fuel type”, which indicates how volatile those fuels are, how intensely and deeply they will burn, and how difficult it might be to suppress a fire in that fuel type. A campfire ban will usually be rescinded once the BUI reaches a value that is 20% lower than the threshold value that triggered the ban’s implementation. The Buildup Index allows the province’s six fire centres to follow a consistent and scientific process for evaluating the need for campfire prohibitions.
In order to have a safe and successful burn:

ensure an open burn is never left unattended
use tools like windy.com (this includes local wind speeds and direction, and provides more detail than high-level weather forecasts – there is also a layer for windy.com data available in our mobile app)

"Provincial Wildfire Status Update – May 4, 2023",1683180000,"
A cool, dry spring has resulted in delayed green-up. Combined with drought conditions over the winter, fine fuels continue to be quite susceptible to ignition. Above seasonal temperatures last weekend further increased wildfire risk. This has resulted in 104 human-caused wildfires since April 1, 2023. While the predominance of human-caused fires is not unusual for this time of year, the dryness of fuels has resulted in fires growing quickly, especially in windy conditions.
This weekend, conditions are expected to return to seasonal in the southern half of the province. However, the Prince George Fire Centre is expected to remain hot and dry. Fire risk and behaviour is expected to decrease in areas experiencing green-up. Increased fire risk may persist in areas where moisture content of fuels remains low, a phenomenon known as the spring dip.
Onboarding and training of wildfire personnel is on-going, and crews are supporting with flood response in the Northwest, Kamloops and Southeast Fire centres. 



Summary
Weather forecast
We are expecting cloudy skies and scattered showers across much of the province today. Throughout the week, we will see gradual warming and drying affecting all regions except the northwest and northern areas of the coast. 
Currently, there is a risk of thunderstorms currently the southeast. This is expected to elongate towards the northwest as the week progresses. Temperatures expected to trend significantly above seasonal by the end of the week/weekend.

Considerations for open burning 
In British Columbia it is common for grass fires to ignite and spread quickly in early spring. Typically, fine fuels remain quite dry in March and April, when daytime temperatures begin to increase but the snow remains at high elevations. While these dry conditions are favourable for prescribed fire and open burning, the risk and prevalence of human-caused wildfires increases as a result.  As the province transitions into spring weather patterns, it is important to remember that much of the northeast and southwest regions of the province were experiencing drought conditions late into the fall last year, which may impact spring burning conditions.
Open burning can be a useful tool when conducted responsibly while it is permitted. If conducted irresponsibly or in unsafe conditions, the potential of a human-caused wildfire increases. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable. Always practice safe, responsible fire use where permitted.  If there are no open burning prohibitions established by the Province, it is important to check with local government authorities for any other open burning restrictions.
Learn more: Open Burning 101
In early spring, most escaped open burns have one or all of the following factors in common:

the burn has been left unattended (even for a very short duration)
changes in wind behaviour
poor venting conditions

In order to have a safe and successful burn:

ensure an open burn is never left unattended

Prescribed burn planned for Selous Creek area,1683007200,"
CASTLEGAR – The BC Wildfire Service will be supporting the Regional District of Central Kootenay and Kalesnikoff Lumber Company in conducting a prescribed burn covering up to 65.2 hectares in the Selous Creek area of the Southeast Fire Centre, about two kilometres south of Nelson, to help reduce wildfire threats.
Smoke may impact residents near the burn area and may be visible from Nelson and surrounding areas, and to motorists travelling along Highway 6 and 3A.
The exact timing of this burn will depend on weather and site conditions, but it could begin as early as Friday, May 5, 2023. Burning will proceed if conditions are suitable and allow for smoke dispersal during burn operations, though smoke may also linger in the following days. Since 2017, this project has been an example of the high level of collaboration between regional and municipal governments, fire services and a local timber licensee.
Key goals of this prescribed burn include:

preparing the site for replanting,
returning a natural and necessary process to the land base, and
removing forest fuels to reduce the long-term risk of wildfire.

Fire is a normal and natural process in many of B.C.’s ecosystems. The BC Wildfire Service works regularly with land managers to undertake fuel management activities (including the use of prescribed burns), to help reduce the severity of future wildfires and related threats to communities.

Public urged to use extreme caution when burning throughout the Cariboo,1682661600,"
WILLIAMS LAKE – The BC Wildfire Service is encouraging members of the public and industry personnel to exercise extreme caution when conducting any outdoor burning due to the warmer weather, increased winds and lower humidity levels that are predicted within the Cariboo Fire Centre over the weekend.
Over the past 48 hours the Cariboo Region has experienced 12 wildfires. The majority of these wildfires are currently classified as Under Control; however, some have presented significant challenges to suppression and containment efforts. Please exercise extreme caution when conducting outdoor burning.
There are currently no open burning prohibitions in effect within the Cariboo Fire Centre. However, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that burning is done in a safe manner and in accordance with regulations. Before lighting any fire, it is advised to monitor the upcoming weather forecast and check with your local governments to see if any local burning restrictions are in place.
Anyone conducting an outdoor burn must adhere to the following precautions:

Ensure that adequate resources are on hand to control the fire and stop it from spreading;
Never burn in windy conditions. Weather conditions can change quickly, and the wind may carry embers to other combustible material and start new fires;
Create an appropriately sized fireguard around the planned fire site by clearing away twigs, grass, leaves and other combustible material, right down to the mineral soil;
Never leave a fire unattended;
Make sure that any fire is completely extinguished, and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area for any length of time.

The Cariboo Fire Centre would like to remind all burn registration holders that there is always potential for winter burn piles to “holdover” until the spring. What this means is that burn piles can burn deep and smoulder until the spring. When the weather warms, these smouldering fires can become more active and turn into a wildfire.
Burn registration holders, both current and over the past winter, are encouraged to check on piles that were burned throughout the winter to ensure they are fully extinguished ahead of the Category 3 prohibition coming into effect on Thursday, May 4, 2023.

Category 3 open fire prohibition planned for Cariboo Fire Centre,1682661600,"
WILLIAMS LAKE – Effective at 12 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on Thursday, May 4, 2023, Category 3 open fires will be prohibited across the entire Cariboo Fire Centre region. This prohibition includes the Cariboo Chilcotin Forest District, the 100 Mile House Forest District and the Quesnel Forest District.
This open burning prohibition will prevent human-caused wildfires and protect public safety.
Specifically, prohibited activities that would constitute a Category 3 open fire include:

any fires larger than two meters high by three meters wide;
three or more concurrently burning piles no larger than two meters high by three meters wide;
burning of one or more windrows; and
burning of stubble or grass over an area greater than 0.2 hectares.

Anyone conducting a Category 3 open fire anywhere in Cariboo Region must extinguish any such fire by 12 p.,m. (PDT) May 4, 2023. This prohibition will remain in place until 12 p.m. (PDT) October 27, 2023, or until the public is otherwise notified.
Please view a map of the affected areas below. A map is also available online.

This prohibition does not ban campfires that are half-metre high by a half-metre wide or smaller, and does not apply to cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes.
This prohibition does not ban Category 2 fires, which include one or two concurrently burning piles up to two metres high by three metres wide, or the burning of stubble or grassover an area less than 0.2 hectares.
The Category 3 open fire prohibition applies to all BC Parks, Crown lands and private lands, but does not apply within the boundaries of a local government that has forest fire prevention bylaws in place and is serviced by a fire department. Check with local government authorities for any other restrictions before lighting any fire.
The Cariboo Fire Centre stretches from Loon Lake near Clinton in the south to the Cottonwood River near Quesnel in the north, and from Tweedsmuir Provincial Park in the west to Wells Gray Provincial Park in the east.
Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable and divert critical resources away from lightning-caused fires. Always practice safe, responsible fire use where permitted.

To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cell phone.
Check with your local government or other jurisdictional authorities before lighting a fire of any size since they may have their own restrictions in place.
Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

Public urged to use caution when outdoor burning,1682488800,"
SMITHERS – With the warmer weather and lower humidity levels that are predicted within the Northwest Fire Centre over the next week, the BC Wildfire Service is encouraging members of the public and industry personnel to exercise caution when conducting any outdoor burning.
The weather forecast is calling for a drying trend and as the temperature increases, the grass cures and dries, becoming extremely flammable, especially in windy conditions. Local winds are often strongest in the afternoon and also just as the sun is going down. There are currently no open burning prohibitions in effect within the Northwest Fire Centre. However, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that burning is done in a safe manner in accordance with regulations. Before lighting any fire, it is advised to monitor the upcoming weather forecast and check with your local governments to see if any local burning restrictions are in place.
Anyone conducting an outdoor burn must adhere to the following precautions:

Never leave a fire unattended;
Make sure that any fire is completely extinguished, and the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area for any length of time

The NWFC would like to remind all burn registration holders that there is always potential for winter burn piles to “holdover” until the spring. What this means is that burn piles can and do burn deep and smoulder until the spring when warm weather and snow free conditions allow these smouldering fires to become active and turn into a wildfire.
Burn registration holders, both current and over the past winter, are encouraged to check on piles that were burned throughout the winter to ensure they are fully extinguished.

April 2023 Spring Wildfire Outlook,1681365600,"
Fall 2022 conditions
October 2022 was one of the driest and warmest Octobers on record with daytime highs consistently 4-10 degrees above normal. British Columbia saw very limited precipitation during what is typically a wet month. With very limited moisture, drought conditions in forests were much higher than normal for the late fall.
The elevated drought codes in certain regions, namely the Kamloops Fire Centre, the Rocky Mountain Trench, the Peace Region, and southern portions of the Cariboo, have carried over into spring 2023.
Recent burning conditions
The BC Wildfire Service has observed unusually advanced fire behaviour for this time of year as a result of the current drought conditions and the public should know the majority of spring wildfires are caused by people and are therefore preventable.
Last spring wildfire season (April 1 – June 30, 2022) there were a total of 135 wildfires. 99 per cent of these were human-caused.
This is compared to the summer/fall wildfire season (July 1 – Dec 1, 2022), which included 1,569 wildfire ignitions; 25 per cent of these were human-caused and 74 per cent were naturally caused.




Left: 99 per cent human-caused; 0 per cent natural; 1 per cent undeterminedRight: 25 per cent human-caused; 74 per cent natural; less than 0 per cent undetermined

In early spring, most escaped open burns have one or both of the following factors in common:

the burn has been left unattended (even for a very short duration)
sudden changes in wind speed and direction

In order to conduct a safe and successful burn:

ensure an open burn is never left unattended
use free weather forecast tools such as www.spotwx.com or windy.com (this includes local wind speeds and direction, and provides more detail than high-level weather forecasts – there is also a layer for windy.com data available in our mobile app)
check the venting index

Fires may burn deeper and for longer periods in areas where drought conditions have persisted from the fall of 2022. Be prepared to exert greater effort to extinguish spring burns this year.
If you would like to consult with a professional meteorologist before burning, you can call Environment and Climate Change Canada’s weather one-on-one consultation line at 1-888-292-2222.

The ‘spring dip’ refers to the period after the snow melts and before significant spring rainfall when forest fuels are cured and available to burn. As a result it is common for grass fires to ignite and spread quickly in early spring.
Watch Matt MacDonald, lead fire weather forecaster for the BC Wildfire Service deliver a brief presentation on the spring wildfire outlook. This spring readiness call also includes presentations by Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, Bowinn Ma and technical specialists from Environment and Climate Change Canada and the River Forecast Centre. It includes information on the spring snowpack, freshet and flood season.



Spring wildfire outlook
The BC Wildfire Service anticipates a relatively normal spring pattern with cool conditions and scattered showers across much of the province.
Early season lightning fires are unlikely as the snowpack persists at elevation and continues to bury fuels that are otherwise receptive to lightning ignitions. The Interior is already experiencing valley-bottom grass fire activity (primarily human-caused) and the potential for early-season grass fires elsewhere will depend on the persistence of valley bottom snow.
Elevated drought conditions from fall 2022 will persist until significant and prolonged precipitation is observed.
Possible scenarios


Dry
A dry spring would exacerbate the already dry conditions in some regions and prolong the dry spell that began in the fall.


“Normal”
“Normal” spring convection would result in scattered showers across much of the province. Spring is typically the wettest season of the year in the Interior.


Wet
A wetter than average spring would reduce drought conditions and fire hazard.


Rain over the Easter long weekend helped alleviate drought conditions in some regions including the B.C. Coast and portions of the Kootenays. The rain shadow effect of the Coast Mountains resulted in less rainfall over the Kamloops Fire Centre and the Cariboo where elevated drought codes persist.

Open Burning 101
Open burning can be a useful tool when conducted responsibly while it is permitted. If conducted irresponsibly or in unsafe conditions, the potential of a human-caused wildfire increases. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable. Always practice safe, responsible fire use where permitted.

Strong winds forecast across Cariboo Fire Centre,1680760800,"
WILLIAMS LAKE- Strong winds are forecasted to sweep across the Cariboo Fire Centre over the weekend. The BC Wildfire Service is urging members of the public and industry personnel to exercise extreme caution when conducting any outdoor burning and consider postponing burning until a calmer day.
Currently, there are no open fire prohibitions in effect in the Cariboo Fire Centre. Those conducting any open fire should use caution and be aware of local conditions that might impact their ability to burn safely and control their open fires. Before lighting a fire, please check with your local authority, ensure you are properly prepared, aware of the conditions, and follow open burning regulations:

Establish a fuel break around your Category 2 or Category 3 burn and ensure the fire site is away from buildings, trees, and other combustible materials.
Ensure someone is always monitoring the fire so it doesn’t spread beyond its intended size.
Ensure that sufficient tools and water are on site to control the fire.

Piles to be burned in Seymour Ridge area,1680760800,"
SMITHERS – The BC Wildfire Service will be supporting the Ministry of Forests Wildfire Risk Reduction Program with firefighting personnel to burn piles of wood debris. These piles were created through a 10-hectare fuel management project along the Seymour Ridge trail in effort to reduce the risk of unwanted wildfire. The piles are located on Seymour Ridge, about seven kilometres up Hudson Bay Mountain Road.
This project is scheduled to start as early as April 11, 2023.
Smoke from this burn may be visible from Highway 16, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the surrounding area.
The exact timing of the pile burn will depend on site, weather and venting conditions. Pile burning will proceed only if conditions are suitable and allow smoke to dissipate. Staff from the BC Wildfire Service will carefully prepare, control and monitor these fires.
The intent of the prescribed burn is to remove these debris piles and help reduce fuel in the event of an unwanted wildfire in the area.

Public reminded to be cautious with open fire use,1680760800,"
KAMLOOPS – The Kamloops Fire Centre is urging members of the public to be cautious with open fire use this spring to help reduce the risk of human-caused wildfires. Valley bottom areas continue to be very dry as a result of elevated drought conditions from the fall and receiving little to no precipitation so far this spring making forest fuels easily susceptible to ignition.
Currently, there are no open fire prohibitions in effect in the Kamloops Fire Centre. Those conducting any open fire should use caution and be aware of local conditions that might
impact their ability to burn safely and control their open fires. Before lighting a fire, please check with your local authority, ensure you are properly prepared, aware of the conditions and follow open burning regulations:

Establish a fuel break around your Category 2 or Category 3 burn and ensure the fire site is away from buildings, trees, and other combustible materials.
Ensure someone is always monitoring the fire so it doesn’t spread beyond its intended size.
Ensure that sufficient tools and water on site to control the fire.
Anyone who lights an open fire must also comply with B.C.’s air quality control legislation and follow the Open Burning Smoke Control Regulations . Check the local venting index by calling 1 888 281-2992 or visiting: Venting | Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy 
Make sure the fire is completely extinguished before leaving the area.

Open Burning 101 – Category 2 & Category 3,1680242400,"
In British Columbia it is common for grass fires to ignite and spread quickly in early spring. Typically, fine fuels remain quite dry in March and April, when daytime temperatures begin to increase but the snow remains at high elevations. While these dry conditions are favourable for prescribed fire and open burning, the risk and prevalence of human-caused wildfires increases as a result.  As the province transitions into spring weather patterns, it is important to remember that much of the northeast and southwest regions of the province were experiencing drought conditions late into the fall last year, which may impact spring burning conditions. 
Open burning can be a useful tool when conducted responsibly while it is permitted. If conducted irresponsibly or in unsafe conditions, the potential of a human-caused wildfire increases. Human-caused wildfires are completely preventable. Always practice safe, responsible fire use where permitted.  If there are no open burning prohibitions established by the Province, it is important to check with local government authorities for any other open burning restrictions. 
In early spring, most escaped open burns have one or all of the following factors in common: 

the burn has been left unattended (even for a very short duration)
changes in wind behaviour 
poor venting conditions

In order to have a safe and successful burn:

ensure an open burn is never left unattended
use tools like windy.com (this includes local wind speeds and direction, and provides more detail than high-level weather forecasts – there is also a layer for windy.com data availabe in our mobile app) 
check the venting index

Learn more about what you need to know before lighting an open burn of any kind below. 

Open burning is classified into four categories with separate criteria. To learn more specifically about Category 2 and Category 3 open fire, safety an responsibility, how to register and more continue reading below. 
Category 2 Open Fire   

This category refers to fires, other than a campfire, that burn: 

material in one pile not exceeding 2 metres in height and 3 metres in width 
material concurrently in 2 piles each must not exceed 2 metres in height and 3 metres in width
stubble or grass over an area that does not exceed 0.2 hectares

Example: During the spring, farmers and ranchers may conduct controlled burns for agricultural purposes. 




Category 3 Open Fire

This category refers to an open fire that burns: 

material concurrently in 3 or more piles each, not exceeding 2 metres in height and 3 metres in width 
material in one or more piles each exceeding 2 metres in height or 3 metres in width,  
one or more windrows (row of cut hay or woody materials or small grain crop) and/or stubble or grass over an area exceeding 0.2 hectares

Example: The forestry industry may conduct “slash” burning to remove wood debris left behind after timber harvesting.  




Safety and responsibility 
Always check with local authorities and weather conditions before lighting a fire of any size. Before lighting a fire, even if the burn category is not currently prohibited, ensure you are properly prepared, aware of the conditions and following open burning regulations: 

Establish a fuel break around your Category 2 or 3 burn or fire guard around your campfire. 
Ensure someone is always monitoring the fire so it doesn’t spread beyond its intended size.  At least one person equipped with a fire-fighting hand tool and a fire suppression system must monitor the fire at all times.  
Do not burn when venting conditions are “Poor” or “Fair”. 

Registering
A burn registration must be obtained by anyone lighting a Category 3 fire by calling 1 888 797-1717. These numbers are logged into the Open Fire Tracking System (OFTS) along with details about the registered burn. This makes it relatively easy to revoke or reinstate these registration numbers as local weather impacts fire danger. 
Unsure if you need to register your burn? Want to know what your legal obligations are when open burning? The Government of BC has produced a series of pamphlets which detail safe practices and the regulations around open burning.   

Backyard & Industrial Burning – Category 2 (PDF, pamphlet) 
Industrial & Resource Management Burning – Category 3 (PDF, pamphlet) 
Open Burning Practices for Farmers and Ranchers (PDF, factsheet) 

Open Fire Tracking System (OFTS)  
Burn registration numbers are logged into the Open Fire Tracking System (OFTS) along with details about the registered burn. This system allows the BC Wildfire Service to track regulated burning across B.C., manage firefighting resources and minimize false reports of wildfires. Check if local burns are taking place in your area before reporting a suspected wildfire.

Prescribed burn for Boitanio Park and Stampede Park Grounds,1680069600,"
WILLIAMS LAKE – The BC Wildfire Service, in partnership with the City of Williams Lake and Williams Lake First Nation, plans to conduct two prescribed burns within the city of Williams Lake in efforts to reduce wildfire risk in the area.
These prescribed burns will cover a combined 9.5 hectares in Boitanio Park and the Stampede Park Grounds. Burning may begin as early as April 4, 2023 and will continue periodically until April 21, 2023. Ignition will proceed only if conditions are suitable and allow for quick smoke dissipation.
A low- to moderate-intensity surface fire will be lit within pre-established boundaries to remove combustible materials and mimic a naturally occurring ground fire. BC Wildfire Service staff will be working with members of the Williams Lake Fire Department to carefully prepare, control, and monitor the fires at all times. Smoke and flames will be visible in the city of Williams Lake and surrounding area.
While burning is underway, traffic control will be on-site to ensure the safety of public and firefighters, short delays may occur. Fires will be extinguished at the end of the day with on-site monitoring for the evenings.
The intent of the prescribed burns is to reduce the risk of a wildfire spreading within city limits and to promote the growth of local plant species while reducing the spread of invasive plant species.
These prescribed burns will also allow the Williams Lake Fire Department and BC Wildfire Service to work together outside of emergency response activities, which is important for strengthening inter-agency coordination. This is a continuation of a relationship with Williams Lake First Nation to grow capacity and knowledge for cultural and prescribed burning.
