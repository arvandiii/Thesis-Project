DOTD decided to postpone the concert to Thanksgiving long weekend, they have also switched tickets for individual day holders (original Saturday ticket is not a Friday ticket etc.). Given that the dates have materially changed to a date that a lot of people will not be able to attend for various reasons (most common is family thanksgiving) I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with deadline with Thick’s as Thieves entertainment.

They have suggested we donate the tickets or sell on marketplace. For many that were directly impacted by the fires, or have given elsewhere this does not make sense financially. For selling on marketplace , this has not been successful for most as DOTD as reopened ticket sales as a direct competitor.

They have also “updated” their policy on their site to state that refunds will not be provided should the event be postponed. This was not there before the wildfires. 

Has anyone had any success with getting their tickets refunded?

I know this post likely won't reach the intended person but still, I feel the need to vent my frustration with yet another example of people's unhinged stupidity and ignorance these days.

Tying your dogs immediately in front of the door is bad because:

1. Blocking a fire exit
2. Someone could get attacked if the dogs get spooked or accidentally stepped on, or they aren't friendly dogs
3. Irresponsible ownership of animals. Either don't bring them, have a trusted person watch them while your in the store, or if you absolutely MUST bring them, tie them up out of the way where they'll be more relaxed and not likely to cause an incident.
4. There's likely other issues with this whole scenario that aren't coming across my mind at this exact moment.
5. EDIT: Some stores are actually dog friendly and will let you bring them in, provided they're on a leash and not making any mess. Never hurts to try asking the employee(s).

Tuesday, August 22, 2023 - 11:07[McDougall Creek Wildfire 2023](https://www.cordemergency.ca/emergencies/mcdougall-creek-wildfire-2023)

Kelowna, B.C. – Assessments to identify properties with significant structural damage from the wildfires in the McDougall Creek Wildfire are now complete. Damage assessments conducted by the Canada Task Force 1 Team, is the first step in aiding the public notification process. The release of this information to affected residents is a priority today for the communities of West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation and the Regional District of the Central Okanagan Electoral Area West, in learning the status of their properties. 

To date, three of the four property owners in the City of Kelowna and three properties in the District of Lake Country have been contacted to confirm significant structural damage on their properties. Residents currently on order are strongly encouraged to register with Emergency Support Services at [https://ess.gov.bc.ca*open\_in\_new*](https://ess.gov.bc.ca/) to support contacting property owners affected. Patience is requested during this process as assessments are conducted within a large area with ongoing wildfire hazards and will require time to ensure accuracy.  

As Evacuation Orders are downgraded, residents returning home can access frequently asked questions and other [resources](https://www.cordemergency.ca/resources) to aid in a safe return. The public is reminded, for the safety of the public and fire crews, please do not enter areas under an evacuation order. There are still many areas where active firefighting is underway and dangers like downed power lines, hazardous materials, damaged trees, debris and equipment pose a safety risk.  

Residents are asked to stay up to date with the status of evacuation alerts and orders through the CORD emergency site and also subscribe to receive e-updates. Go online to [cordemergency.ca](https://www.cordemergency.ca/). View the up-to-date evacuation order and alert areas on [cordemergency.ca/map](http://www.cordemergency.ca/map).  

For more information, contact the information line at 250-469-8490 (local) or 1-877-569-8490(toll-free).

[Source](https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/442949/The-province-has-lifted-the-travel-ban-to-interior-communities-except-West-Kelowna)

Just announced by MinisterMa  - effective Midnight tonight.

It still could be imposed or extended again, depending on conditions.

The ban opened up thousands of rooms they needed, so it appears they aren’t as short on rooms now. Recommended you should still not travel to these regions, mentioned in the initial [**Travel Ban Order**](https://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/provincial-state-of-emergency-august-18-2023/) \- This now includes the amendment made today:

In a [Statement issued Tuesday, August 22nd,](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023EMCR0057-001332) Bowinn Ma, Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness, announced the Emergency Order restricting non-essential use of temporary accommodations **will be lifted** for Kelowna, Kamloops, Oliver, Osoyoos, Penticton and Vernon effective Wednesday, August 23rd.

Restrictions will remain in place for West Kelowna, where non-essential travel **for the purpose of staying in temporary accommodation, including hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, hostels, RV parks, and campgrounds, remains prohibited.**

This restriction will support access to accommodations for evacuees and personnel providing emergency and critical services. The public is asked to avoid non-essential travel to areas impacted by wildfires. Roadways must remain clear for emergency response operations.

**ATTENTION!!** The full order from the BC Government is linked above for you to read in full.This —-> [**Travel Ban Order**](https://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/provincial-state-of-emergency-august-18-2023/) \- Please note this is still only about Accommodations and there is no order preventing you from travel along these routes. You are only being asked to avoid travel to the fire regions if you can do so. West Kelowna remains as a city where you are prohibited from booking accommodation.

But deep down inside you know you’re dirty, disgusting and nothing but an annoyance. Sure, they say that during a drought you can take a smoke bath. You know who takes smoke baths these days? Nobody. We have soaps with lotions and creams. You, on the other hand, are good for making beef jerky. I don’t want to smell like beef jerky. It’s not a flattering perfume. 

You’re the worst thing about a campfire. Like an unwanted guest at a cocktail party you hover and mingle in the faces of people who just want to roast their weenies, perhaps toast their buns on the metal grill and keep warm. But no…you gotta get up in everybody’s faces and make people crazy until they start screaming nonsensical words like *White Rabbits* over an over again like inmates at the Hickory Farms Insane Asylum. 

I was walking down Enterprise earlier today and there was this dude screaming *White Rabbits! I Hate White Rabbits!* at the top of his lungs. He wasn’t a crazy street person. He wasn’t on drugs. He said he was the freaking mayor. 

I asked the mayor, “What’s wrong?” I shook his hand and said, “You’re doing a good job. This smoke isn’t your fault. None of this is your fault…”

“White Rabbits…white rabbits. They used to be on Enterprise, but now they are on Harvey and only I can see them!”

Maybe that guy wasn’t really the mayor. Perhaps he was crazy. Or perhaps you made him crazy, Smoke.

Do you want to know why people say *I Hate White Rabbits* when you get all up in our faces? Well, it’s an interesting story that dates itself to the Boy Scouts. Apparently a camp councillor told the kids that smoke was made of billions of tiny white rabbits, fluttering about in random trajectories by the wind and the heat of the flames. The story gained enough traction to become an urban legend.

But the real question we have to ask is, what the hell were you doing hanging around with a bunch of underage children, Smoke? And why were you prancing around their bodies doings little seductive dances? If you don’t quit that behaviour Ronan Farrow gonna write a *Vanity Fair* article about you. 

Okay, I will concede you do make a hotdog taste better. But why must you insist on smoking all the humans? What are you planning, Smoke? Why are you trying to seal in all our succulent juices?

I think it is time to leave town, Smoke. While you might be the inspiration for Wayne Wang’s second best movie, your time has come to pass. The problem is you are lazy. You just sit there, doing nothing like a nihilistic teen asking adults if they can by them cigarettes outside the 7-11. You have no skills outside of flavouring meats and signalling nomadic hunter gatherers when they can’t find their IPhones. 

And yet, some day soon a hard rain will fall, or perhaps a mild breeze will dance down this valley and carry you away. And as you drift away from our memories until next fire season, remember: you are not made of little rabbits. You are a suspension of airborne particles and gasses mixed with air. Technically you are an unwanted byproduct of fire. That’s right, Smoke, even Fire doesn’t want your lazy ass hanging around.

If you have a window AC unit, floor (portable, with tubes) AC unit, or even an old box fan, all you need is a furnace filter. I used one of these: [https://www.homedepot.ca/product/filtrete-filters-filtrete-healthy-living-maximum-allergen-filter-mpr-1900-16-in-x-25-in-x-1-in-3-per-pack/1000668614](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/filtrete-filters-filtrete-healthy-living-maximum-allergen-filter-mpr-1900-16-in-x-25-in-x-1-in-3-per-pack/1000668614)

This is similar to the Corsi-Rosenthal Box concept created during the COVID 19 pandemic, however it only uses one filter instead of 4 and uses equipment that many people already have. I don't know many people who have box fans, but I know countless people with portable/window AC units. The boxes are undoubtedly better, but this still works and is much cheaper and easier to make.

Simply pick a filter that fits your AC's interior air intake closely in one dimension, and then cut it to size in the other dimension. In this case a 16 inch wide filter fit my unit perfectly, I just had to cut it in half to fit the vertical dimension. Then, making sure you align the airflow direction arrow correctly (these are directional filters) tape it to the unit with whatever you have. I used some aluminium tape because I wanted to do a fairly neat job, but you can use duct tape, electrical tape, or anything else that will hold it on. The suction will pull the filter against the unit, you just want to seal off as many gaps as possible so that most of the air goes through the filter. You can usually get two uses out of a single filter, so it's cost effective, with the filters usually costing $20-$30 each. I usually have to replace them during smoke season once per month, your mileage may vary depending on your AC. Mine is a 12,000 BTU Toshiba unit from 2019, and does an excellent job of moving lots of air, and in my experience has beat out a $250 Danby purifier with one of these filters.

You can also do this with an industrial box fan that can be purchased for cheap at most hardware stores and are normally not in super high demand as they are large and can be loud, so find one that is bearable for you and accept the tradeoff of a bit more noise for cleaner air. You can always run it during the day when you are away from home and turn it off when you get back, it'll still filter a lot of air in that time.

Keep in mind if your AC has an especially weak fan, this may not work super well, and may trip the machine's circuit protection, causing it to pulse the fan. I've had this happen with another machine, and the solution was to leave a gap at the edges, after which it worked fine and still managed to turn the filter entirely dark brown after the fire season in 2021 so it did obviously still did something.

&#x200B;

During the White Rock Lake fire we came across this FireSmart BC thing which details what you can do around the around of your house to better protect it from the wildfires nearby. It goes over the different types of mulch, fuel sources, plants and landscaping features which can make it easier for fires to start and spread around your home. 

&#x200B;

We found it helpful as a guide while we were on evac alert to try and help protect our house as much as possible in the event the fire got close to our house. Moving mulch away from the house itself, pruning trees and cutting down the landscaping grasses can slow the fire or stop it from burning up against your house, as well as remove a flammable source where embers can land.

Edit: thank you all for your help! My issue has luckily been solved thanks to a super nice person at Airbnb Support. If you are in a similar situation, as in you were supposed to leave out of the province and Airbnb is refusing to allow you under their policy to get a refund, then definitely call them, explain you couldn’t leave because of a natural disaster, and when they eventually say there’s nothing they can do ask to talk to their boss or someone that can actually do something. If you treat them with respect in a calm manner they are very likely to help you as they did me. An hour after talking with this person and asking for someone that can do something they got back to me with a full refund. 

Again thank you for your help and fight for your money especially in these trying times!

Hi my name is josh I'm posting this on behalf of my disabled mom. Any help would be greatly appreciated!


------------------------------------------------------------------------

I currently have a hotel room. But I haven't been able to speak to the emergency services. With regards to getting help with the cost. I have my card to get in line to get the ticket that I need to get to the hotel but I have to go over to the westside to line up to obtain this ticket.  The hotel wants to wants to me to leave the hotel room.  

  Right now, the University is on full  evacuation and because my apartment building (800 academy way) is tied to the University Mission Group told us to evacuate last night i was  put on  a evacuation alert.


  The rest of my neighbors have evacuated. Im not sure how close the fire is im worried im going to have to return only for the fire to change and i wont be able to get out.   My son was able to help me get out but he is also physically disabled, has autism, and lives in assisted living so he is unable to help

I have a small senior dog and i cannot walk without assistance and i am in a huge amount of pain. Im worried about losing my place to stay.

Am I qualify as officially evacuated because I can't afford another night at the hotel?  Should I keep the room? I don't know what to do.  Anybody got any information like they could tell me before I leave the hotel? 

Thanks you so much for your time. I know this is a stressful time for everyone and my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected or has lost their homes.

The fires were then fuelled by strong winds from an offshore hurricane. 

With Kelowna being a city obviously at risk from wildfires and sometimes prone to storms, it sounds like burying our power lines could be an effective strategy to help mitigate fire risk. I know some of the more expensive real-estate streets near where I live in the Mission already have buried lines, and maybe it's already policy for newer developments. But does anyone with more knowledge of this than me have any insight into the feasibility of doing it for existing overhead lines? Is it already on the city's roadmap?

You may think you’re so hot, but really…it’s the CO2. You ain’t got nothing compared to those younger, stars. They’re bigger, alright. But they’re bigger in all the right places. It’s that low metalicity. Super, sexy, low metalicity.

Sure you’re not as old as the Red Dwarfs in the neighborhood, but you go to the same parties. Astronomers say you both may have life, which means you have the same lifestyle. You shop at the same boutiques, while the younger, hotter suns shop at Forever 21.

And some day you’re going to get fat…so fat that your circumference will extend all the way to Mars. Perhaps Jupiter. Say what you want about the Red Dwarfs, but they manage to keep it tight. 

Oh, and by the way, sun…all those little forest fires just make people hate you more. It’s super annoying and some of us have asthma.  And the boiling of the salmon in the rivers is borderline sociopathic. Like you would even eat salmon. You’re the kind of sun that eats nothing but pizza. We see all those little spots on your surface. You don’t get that kind of complexion eating boiled salmon.

And enough with the Northern Lights, honey. It comes off a little desperate and a tad dramatic. You’re not Michelangelo. You’re a big ball of gas. We haven’t even named you. We just call you *sun*. You’re name isn’t even capitalized when written in the middle of a sentence.

The City is seeking the public’s help to identify the culprits who poisoned a mature tree at 1055 Sunset Drive. This incident is the third of its kind within the last 12 months, excluding a separate incident involving a burnt tree on Earth Day.



“It’s hard to understand how someone in our community would go out of their way to kill a tree like this, to drill 25 holes in it and fill them with herbicide,” says Infrastructure General Manager Mac Logan. “The City will have to recover the cost to eventually remove the tree replace it, but the idea that someone would actively choose to harm their community in this way bothers me greatly. It’s now happened for a third time in less than a year and we as a community need to stop such acts.”



Tragically, the poisoned tree will perish over the next two to three months and City staff will seek to preserve the tree in an effort to continue to support local wildlife until it is deemed a safety hazard and needs to be removed.



Previous acts of intentional vandalism targeted urban trees on Manhattan Drive and in the Clarence Greenspace area. The vandalism at Clarence Greenspace last summer led to the harm of more than just the initial target. Due to a connected root system, six other Aspen trees died as a result.



In addition to the targeted poisonings, on Earth Day this year, the Kelowna Fire Department responded to a fire burning in the root system of a mature tree in Kelowna’s waterfront park on Cedar Avenue, and while extinguished, the tree was significantly damaged and had to be removed.



Investigations to identify individuals responsible for this latest case of vandalism are underway and we strongly encourage residents to come forward with any information they might have. 



Anyone who may have witnessed, or has information relating to, this incident is asked to phone the Kelowna RCMP at 250-762-3300 referencing file number 2023-800746.



If you wish to remain anonymous, you may also contact Central Okanagan Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or leave a tip online at crimestoppers.net.",,,kelowna,Why????,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/13lgiss/why/

Are there walk in clinics? Might be a stupid question but there arent any where I am now despite the fact that I live in a major city. Its emergency room or nothing. And people have started dying before they can be seen.

My second biggest concern is does home insurance cover wildfires? Or is it like Florida where they won't cover any storm that has a name because they happen so often?

My last concern is how badly does fire season affect quality of life? Like is from June to September basically a wash in terms of outdoor activity? Is the air dangerous for someone with asthma/lung issues?

TLDR; I love gardening and know Kelowna is well known for its fruits and veggies and farm stands etc but what is the average home gardener experiencing in terms of growing things with frequent water bans, scorching Temps etc? This wouldn't keep me from moving there I am more just curious about this one.

Thanks for any insight 😊. I have read thru other posts like this but couldn't find answers to these questions.

Kelowna, B.C. – The Emergency Operations Centre has launched an online search tool for City of West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation and Central Okanagan West Electoral Area properties that have experienced partial to full structure loss resulting from the McDougall Creek Wildfire. 

Property owners who have been placed on Evacuation Order can search to see if their property has incurred losses by visiting [www.cordemergency.ca/propertyinfo](http://www.cordemergency.ca/propertyinfo). If your property has not been placed on Evacuation Order, your address will not show. The Emergency Operation Centre asks the general public to be respectful of this process – if you are not on evacuation order do not use the search tool. 

The search tool follows the work of Canada Task Force 1 Team, which completed assessments to identify properties that incurred losses in the wildfires. This was the first step in aiding in the public notification process. Further hazard assessments must now be completed at each property, to determine the number and types of structures lost on each property. That process is completed in the City of Kelowna and District of Lake Country. The process will take longer but remains a priority in the communities of West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation and the Regional District of the Central Okanagan West Electoral Area where losses have been greater.  

To date, three of the four property owners in Kelowna and three properties in Lake Country have been contacted to confirm significant structural damage on their properties. These properties are not included in the search tool. 

The EOC expresses condolences to everyone who has experienced losses from the McDougall Creek, Clifton/McKinley and Lake Country Wildfires. 

“Some of the most challenging days are ahead. People and communities will learn of monumental loss. This will be a process of grief collectively. As we move into recovery, the needs of each impacted community will be different,” said Loyal Wooldridge, Regional District of Central Okanagan Chairperson. 

“Communities have experienced great impacts and losses and will take more time to recover. I am confident that our collective resilience will guide us forward,” Wooldridge said. “Let us honour the sacrifice and efforts made by so many over the past few days by confronting these challenges with unity and compassion. United as a region, we will recover, rebuild and restore.” 

Residents currently on evacuation order are strongly encouraged to register with Emergency Support Services at [https://ess.gov.bc.ca*open\_in\_new*](https://ess.gov.bc.ca/) to ensure contact information for any affected property owners is up to date.

SouthernAccident4,,,,1692488702,,,15vvgac,,,,,,t3_15vvgac,9,,/r/kelowna/comments/15vvgac/emergency_mental_health_tips/,,,," As a community, we are going through what are likely some of the most harrowing days of our lives thus far. My heart goes out to everyone who is on the front lines, who has been evacuated, who is anxiously anticipating the further unfolding of events, and who is offering help to those in need. Friends and neighbours, we are in this together!

I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor who lives and works in Kelowna. During my Masters in Counselling, I did extensive research into the mental health impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. Based on my research, here are a few practical tips we can use to support ourselves and each other during this truly unsettling, truly unprecedented time:

1. **Connect with your community.** Coming together in community is one of the best things we can do in this dire situation. If you are able, find ways to help people out by donating to support agencies, offering space in your home for evacuees, or volunteering your time.
2. **Lean into relationships.** When you are able, be a support to others by reaching out, talking with them, helping them out if needed, and making yourself available. When you need support, reach out to friends, family, and loved ones. There are always people who are able to offer help and people who need assistance!
3. **Talk about your feelings.** Any emotional response you are having is normal and valid. If you are afraid, that is completely understandable; if you find yourself in emotional denial, that’s normal too; or if you are feeling positive, energetic, and eager to help - also a normal response! Everyone’s nervous system reacts differently to emergencies. Again, the best thing we can do is lean into our communities in whatever capacity we have.
4. **Know whose mental health is at risk.** Not everyone is at equal risk of developing adverse mental health during extreme weather events. Anyone who lives in close relationship with the land is at higher risk. This includes Indigenous peoples, farmers, outdoor workers, and anyone who is concerned about the environment. Minority groups, individuals with a history of trauma, and individuals with already present mental health concerns are also at heightened risk. Take a moment to think about who you know that falls into one of these categories; if you are able, reach out to them.
5. **Be aware of long-term mental health impacts.** Individuals who have past experience with traumatic events and/or extreme weather can develop longer-term mental health challenges such as Acute Stress Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. These conditions do not always develop right away; it can take up to a year or more for symptoms to emerge. Don’t be afraid though - mental health struggles are treatable! Be aware of symptoms associated with these challenges. If you notice symptoms developing in yourself or someone you know, reach out for professional support. Also be aware that experiences of extreme weather and natural disaster can become cumulative, leaving an individual at higher risk of developing adverse mental health in the future.
6. **Advocate for climate action.** Human-caused climate change is making extreme weather such as wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, and floods more frequent and more severe. If you are concerned about climate change then find ways to advocate for climate action. Here are some ideas: write to your elected officials, write letters to the editors of your local news outlets, join a climate advocacy group like one listed below, and talk with family, friends, and loved ones about your climate concerns. Research suggests that the one of best things we can do is to use our collective anger, grief, and anxiety to fuel conversations about climate action.

I’m adding the obvious, but will update as suggestions come in:

- photo albums
- passports
- birth certificates
- wills
- home videos
- essential legal documents (any lawyers willing to weigh in?)
- medicine
- all ID
- non perishable snacks
- water
- 4 socks 5 undergarments 4 shirts 2 pants
- Hygiene stuff (try not to bring large soaps and zip lock bag them)
- 8"" by 8"" valuables box
- Charger & phone.
- Small pillow or garbage bag for your shirts. (Use plastic garbage bags to make sure your bag doesn't get wet)

Don't bring toys, just take pictures of your stuff. People are more important than stuff

If you have enough room for 1 book, or sketch pad and pens it's a good idea.

If you must bring your PC, just bring the tower, have it in a garbage bag and use shirts / pants to cushion it. Double knot it so its easier to carry and quickly get on a bus.


If you have pets:
- pet food
- pet kennel ( most evac Centers have rules about containment)
- treats
- bed

I want to use this picture for a piece on climate change, but I just want to make sure that it's legit and everything. Is this definitely a real wildfire like it's supposed to be? Just checking because so little information is provided. I wonder if it's actually a controlled burn of some sort rather than a wildfire. 

Also, what *stage* is this wildfire in? What's going on? Is that *after* the wildfire has done the vast majority of its damage? It doesn't seem like the trees have been reduced to just char or anything like that. 

Lastly, take a look at the very leftmost tree in the photo. That tree has a ring of fire around its base. What might explain that ring of fire around the base? It's interesting. I'm not sure why the fire is doing that or what explains that.

Someone said this: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/forestry/comments/16flxfg/can_someone_help_me_understand_this_picture_of_a/k02ljv1/

>Pretty hard to give a definitive answer based off a single picture. I would say it isn't really safe to try and tie a story to a photo when you don't have any real source information for the picture . Best guess this is a picture taken from a containment line after a burnout. So firefighters have constructed a line to try and stop an approaching fire and then purposely ignited fires along that line to burn back toward the approaching fire. They do this in an attempt to reduce fuels available to the approaching fire as it moves toward their line. My speculation is based off this looking like an underburn and it would make sense why someone was there to take a picture. The rings of fire around the base of the trees is likely do to a build up of needles and other fuel around the bases. When I say this looks like an underburn I mean the fire has stayed in the lower levels and doesn't appear to have consumed the tree canopies but again that is hard to say definitively from a single picture.

My worry is that it's not a natural fire.

Hey all,

I did wildfire for several years (T2IA, Helitack, Fuels) and, had every intention of staying for life. Like most, however, I made the decision to move on for the sake of my family.

* Should I stick to seasonal with my only one season of experience? (I break past the 90 day fire experience mark)
* Am I overlooking anything important in this quest for fed life? I'm single, no dependents or pets, no lease, no real responsibilities apart from my fitness and safety.

I feel like I post something like this in here every week but USAJOBS isn't exactly a class in college where they teach you this stuff.

My understanding is that this (probably?) put me in the WA DNR IQCS(?) database for mobilization purposes. My department routinely mobed a strike team every summer for both in and out of state deployments.

Fast forward 12 years. My department leadership has turned over. The chief who was our wildland crew boss retired and moved away, and the department no longer trains wildland or mobes. The new department training leadership can't find my red card and doesn't have reason to look very hard.

Nobody is saying you have to have all the answers right now but keep your long term perspective, be conscious of your cash flows, and engage in moderate hedonism along the way.

I’m brand new to the world of fire so sorry if this is a stupid question. I saw some permanent jobs in my region (4) opened up this week and I was wondering if I should apply now or keep waiting just a little longer. 

What does permanent position mean? Wildland firefighting year round? Because as far as I’m aware fire season is just the summer right?

Also, the posting on usajobs said it was for my region and Alaska, but I live in idaho and sure as hell can’t work in Alaska. Should I still apply or just keep waiting?

I know this is nooby as hell. Sorry about that. I’ve never had any exposure to firefighting until this last year and I kinda had to learn it all myself.

One more thing, I shouldn’t bother to go for a GS4 job right? I don’t have any relevant experience but I do have an EMT class in progress right now that should be done in December.

ANY AND ALL tips are welcome and greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I am returned once again to impart some financial knowledge for your end of season. While you were all waiting for fire season (finally here) I studied the blade. Big shouts out to Santaclaus Hotshots, saw you boys flowing north as I ripped south to go get fucked up at a wedding in Napa, so happy day 5/6, get that paper. Instead of blowing up this sub every couple of weeks, I decided maybe it would be better to give you totally unsolicited advice when it comes to personal finances at the end of the season before y'all do something dumb with your money. Up to you all if you want to use it or not. TO BE CLEAR - I'm not telling you to YOLO your fire season into 0DTE calls on AMC, that would be 100p on you. This is simply an attempt to help you grow your wealth and not go into next fire season broke. 

&#x200B;

* If you have a retirement account with your agency and they match your contributions, awesome, you're a good little saver! It's free money so don't leave it on the table. If you do **NOT** have a retirement account or refuse to let the government invest on your behalf (I don't blame you) here is what I would do:
   * Go to your bank or another financial institution and open a Roth IRA. You can contribute $6,500 annually unless you make over $153,000 as a SINGLE tax filer ($228,000 for y'all married folks/joint filers). Roth IRA's give you the benefit of using post-tax income and you wont have to pay any subsequent income tax in the future on any gains from your investments. Additionally, a Roth has ZERO penalties if used before retirement for education expenses AND financing a home will only require around 3% down. Pretty neat, innit?
* Determine your investment style and objectives. I commented on someones post about this earlier this season and included it here. Buy low sell high. 
   * [How to think about your investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/12qtdp2/post_your_personal_finance_for_firefighters_tips/jgtg21a/?context=3)
* DEBTS
   * Know the difference between ""good debt"" and ""bad debt."" Pay off your bad debt first while making the minimum payments on your good debt to avoid getting murdered by interest rates.
      * Good debt - anything less than 5%
      * Bad debt - anything over 5%
EDIT: good debt would also include something that GAINS intrinsic/extrinsic value like student loans, mortgages, business loans. Bad debt would be thing that depreciate in value such as a vehicle or a credit card. One loses value while the other has an absolutely jacked interest rate. 

* The 1x1 or 2x rule
   * Do you ever feel guilty about making a frivolous purchase after the season ends? Me either, thats why I have a Tikka T3X A1 tactical in 6.5 with a Viper PST Gen II MRAD scope and Harris bipod. But on the flip side of that, any time I make a ""large"" purchase out of pure hedonism I also put the same amount (or more) into my retirement/investments. This way I don't feel so bad about being a degenerate. Whatever you are willing to spend on yourself, double it. Now you'll be wealthier in the years to come AND you have a new snowmobile (its a 2012 skidoo but its new to you).
* Broad based exposure, long term perspective
   * You are absolutely not going to beat the investment banks or hedge funds. Many have tried and few have succeeded. Capturing alpha in a world where there is less and less every day is a fools gambit. Trust me, I've been doing quantitative analysis on stocks for years and if theres anything I have learned its that markets and banks will stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent.
      * Example - backtest to 1982, if you had invested $10,000 in the S&P that would be worth $1.5m today
   * ETF's, index funds, and mutual funds are your friend here. They are very similar as far as structure where you own a bundle of stocks rather than one on its own. Much more tolerant to risk and negative volatility.
* Dividend Snowball
   * Dividends are just payments companies make to investors for owning their assets, not all companies pay them out but there are some powerhouse companies out there that return astounding amounts of capital over time. 
      * For example - you bought 10 shares of Company ABC for $100/ea. ABC pays you a 4% annual dividend on a quarterly basis (4% for the year, 1% every three months). While $40 doesn't seem like a lot, you are essentially buying 40% of one stock in your first year and as it pays out over time that will compound into more shares and higher payout so long as you hold onto your shares. 
   * It may look small now but the power of compound interest and dividend reinvestment will grow overtime. This is almost exactly how Berkshire is structured now. Warren doesn't really seek out individual winners or hedge risk anymore because the portfolio generates insane amounts of free cash flow. Stick with it for the long run and keep stacking it up. 

Thats all I have for you. Think of investing as sacrificing some purchasing power today for WAY more purchasing power down the road. It's the difference between financing an F-250 King Ranch right now vs paying cash somewhere down the road. With any luck, some of y'all will put away 10% of your cash to make it more bigger. Use that information as you will and I hope you all have a safe rest of your season. Be the American the Japanese believe you to be. 

Also shouts out to all the contractors who got butthurt when I told the goggins wannabe to go suck his dick. Keep it up and one day you’ll be able to pass the fitness test.

Fit: size 9.5D and they are made slightly wider to support a bigger foot which was very nice, not too much bite

In case of paywall: 


British Columbia has pulled firefighting crews out of the North Shuswap area after a group of protesters confronted RCMP at a highway checkpoint, where the demonstrators argued the Mounties do not have the authority to block people from entering a wildfire evacuation zone.

Forrest Tower, a spokesperson for BC Wildfire Service, on Thursday confirmed the Wednesday evening retreat and attributed it, in part, to the protesters on the Trans-Canada Highway near Sorrento. The crews were reassigned to neighbouring firefighting efforts and have not yet returned. BCWS said the protest, in an area where tension between local residents and fire officials is high, put its teams in danger.

A video of the Shuswap clash, posted on Facebook, shows a small group challenging RCMP officers at a checkpoint, with orange pylons and what appears to be a spike belt separating the two sides.

Jeff Rosner, a Sicamous resident who recorded the incident, said the crowd members attended the checkpoint to seek answers about the fire. They tried to bring supplies such as food and fuel to friends inside the evacuation zone who remained to defend their property, he added.

The protest was reminiscent of those that unfolded during the pandemic, when some people opposed to COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates banded together to challenge politicians and those who enforce the law. Misinformation, a distrust of authority and the belief that individual rights trump all defined the extended pandemic protests – and the themes resurfaced on the video of the Wednesday clash.

Derek Sutherland, the head of protective services at the Columbia Shuswap Regional District, said that while local community members have not always agreed with how fire officials have managed fires in the area, North Shuswap residents told him they reject the group that gathered at the police barricade.

“They are not supportive of this freedom convoy that was coming to the area,” Mr. Sutherland said. Local residents, he said, were not part of the confrontation.

Mr. Rosner, on the other hand, said everyone in the crowd was from the Shuswap area, including evacuees.

Janis Smith, a Celista resident, said the agitators should leave the community: “I don’t know who they are and what they are trying to accomplish but they are making it worse, so if they could just go home that would be great.”

RCMP, in a statement Thursday, said no one was arrested and that the Mounties do not expect to press any charges: “It appeared that the intentions of those involved were to overwhelm the police road block and gain access to the area.”

Police have increased their presence in the area in response to what they described as “ongoing efforts by some individuals who have undermined BC Wildfire Service fire suppression work through the movement of vital equipment, and have compromised emergency personnel safety through threats of violence.”

The area, RCMP said, is not safe because of the threat from wildfires, as well as damage to power lines and unstable trees and buildings.

Mr. Tower, BCWS’s information officer, said fire officials considered a number of factors, including the protest, before pulling crews out of the North Shuswap area and temporarily reassigning them to other parts of the Bush Creek East and Rossmoore Lake wildfires.

BCWS, on social media Wednesday, said it was aware of an “organized effort to dismantle” an RCMP checkpoint.

“This is the latest of several decisions that have significantly impacted operational activities in the area. At this time, the environment is unsafe for BCWS operations,” the post said, adding it would pull crews out of the North Shuswap area.

“This decision was not made lightly. The safety of people is our primary concern.”

The BCWS posts, which appeared shortly before 10 p.m., were quickly deleted. Mr. Tower said BCWS made the posts based on information from RCMP and other partners. As it was posted, RCMP informed BCWS that the “situation that we were describing was not as serious in the moment,” Mr. Tower said.

BCWS opted to delete, rather than revise, the post “in an effort to not give something steam that didn’t, and doesn’t, deserve to have it,” he said. “We know the power of social media in terms of making something bigger than it might be.”

Mr. Tower said crews were constructing a fireguard near Sorrento prior to leaving the area. BCWS estimated it had about two days worth of work left to do there once crews return, he said. Fire behaviour in the area was not “significant or concerning” Thursday and while ground crews have moved out, Mr. Tower said that helicopters continue to work on the entire Bush Creek East blaze.",,,Wildfire,BC Wildfire Service pull firefighters out of North Shuswap after protestors confront RCMP,1.0,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-wildfire-service-pulls-firefighting-crews-out-of-north-shuswap-area/

Power dynamics are such a weird thing.
Talking to a friend and us both realizing that our ascent to power in our careers has been very different.

My friend (white) is very mild mannered he is kind of a push over(admittedly) he assumed his position of power in the same career as me, same position as me. He has had very little to no pushback for implementing new ideas and direction.

Myself? I have had to fight for the most basic shit for the last 3 years of my career(i’ve worked on two different forests in this span of time)  i have been constantly questioned, I have subordinates scream in my face. I’ve been told that I, the superior person in the chain of command need to compromise. I’ve been routinely ham strong by the people above me who tie my hands behind my back. And ask me to manage that way.

Talking to my friend about our very different climb in this career, has been so eye opening.

I thought that getting higher in this job it would change things.

My 2nd year in fire a person high up who I respected told me “people in this line of work are going to have a hard time taking orders from a nigger” that stung like hell. I remember it like it was yesterday. What stings worse is that 10 years later he is still being proven right everyday.

I’ve been physically attacked for being black and doing my job, i’ve been hate crimed in the middle of the woods, in the middle of a rural town. I could go on… but i wont.

I’ve been told i was the aggressor, i was the reason, that it was my fault. Truthfully i was the reason, it was the color of my skin.

These last few months in this job have been especially hard on me and i just needed somewhere to vent.

But i’m not special, this isnt just a problem i am facing.

If you are reading this I just want you to take a tactical pause. I want you to think if there was a time where you couldve stood up for someone who wasnt being treated unfairly, maybe it wasnt their skin color, but maybe it was their sex, or sexual orientation. If you failed them, i want you to atleast think about how you could do better in the future.

I dont want your pity, i want you to do better.

Some additional nuance to my question, by ""how fast does it pass"" I mean, if you were to be stuck in an emergency and have to deploy a fire shelter and ride out the passing fire, how long would you actually have to remain in shelter before it's safe to expose yourself again? I imagine you would have to wait out not just the flames but for an extended period until the temperature winds down, smoke thins out?

Their reasoning is that since they have been working multiple days on district they need to reset before they leave so they don't go over on the maximum days worked for the length of an assignment. 

I was always under the impression that days worked on district would not affect the length of your assignment and they started once you arrived on scene for your assignment. Of course it's nice to take days off before leaving for a couple weeks but I never believed it was actually necessary. I can't find anything that's specifically talks about going from home unit to an assignment though.


What is everyone else's take on this?

Some references:

According the the red book for Forest Service

Maximum Consecutive Days Worked – Home Unit...
FS – During extended periods of activity in support of local fire management, personnel will have a minimum of 2 days off in any 14-day period.


Interagency business management handbook (yellow book)

Management Directed Days Off at Home Unit Supervisors must manage work schedules for initial attack, dispatch, and incident support personnel during extended incident situations.  During periods of non-routine or extended activity, these employees will have a minimum of 1 day off in any 21-day period.  This minimum requirement should rarely be needed since scheduled days off are normally given much more frequently during periods of routine activity.... Indicators of the need for a day off include long shifts, but equally important, the actual observation of the physical and mental condition of the employee.",,,Wildfire,Days off and district days to an incident.,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/15wxe7s/days_off_and_district_days_to_an_incident/

Overlapping jurisdictions were a thing, but for the most part I always felt like IA’s were at least organized chaos and the ICS structure made sense even if it meant in the middle of it a fed fire might become a state fire or vice versa. Maybe it’s just the benefit of the state being contracted to manage the county’s fire management, but upon getting toned out, you at least always knew who the IC was, where you’re going, and what the command and tac channel were, and if I were the first unit on-scene, I knew exactly who to talk to as far as communicating needs, requesting additional resources or whatever. 

I just volunteer now, but we got called out for mutual aid on a larger incident on the Flathead Reservation, and I don’t understand how or why things function the way they do here. The tribe has jurisdiction of the fire, but we as local units aren’t accountable or communicating with their dispatch.

To give some background - I’ve been a marketing technology consultant for 4 years now and have long been considering a career with the forrest service or something else that’s more outdoorsy, hands on, and serving the general public. I have a bachelors degree in business administration from Montana State University with a focus in marketing and a minor in international business. I have little to no experience with fire, medical, or emergency services but spend quite a bit of time outdoors hiking, rock climbing, skiing, or backpacking in my free time. I’ve been involved with sports my whole life. I’m in pretty decent shape, although I should start running or hiking more regularly to prepare my lungs and heart. I’m 5’8 and 165lbs, played team sports most my life growing up (football, wrestling, and baseball) and I miss the camaraderie from those teams quite a bit. 

I’m mostly seeking advice on where I should start. I’m living in Denver, CO at the moment and would prefer to get a job somewhere in the state of CO. Should I look into Americore or should that be a last resort? Would I be better off gaining experience as a volunteer at a fire department while working a side job? I’m also wondering if I should start taking EMT classes in the spring in hopes of improving my chances of getting a job?

So if you were not aware of NFFE until now, it is because we have changed our priorities since 2020.

We encourage everyone in the community to check out what we have been doing lately, which can be found on our [NFFE Wildland Fire](https://nffe.org/wildland-fire/) advocacy webpage. If you have any questions on who we are or how you can get involved, please let us know.

First of all, we share your frustration that this bill is not all encompassing. 

However, NFFE did not “water down” the bill, nor did USDA. NFFE pushed for the maximum percentage pay increase above and beyond the retention pay provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. The compromise that was reached in the bill was due to the political reality of Congress and was out of our hands in the final draft.

NFFE understands that folks do not want to chase hours or assignments. However, is this not the reality at present? Now factor in making $20k less should this bill fail to pass. Is that the situation we want for folks? No.

Yes, it is unfortunate that this bill does not allow for OT to count towards retirement. We will need support for that initiative to be included in future legislation. Are you going to join your colleagues in making that possible?

**This bill was never intended to be permanent fix. It is however the best opportunity that we have to ensure wildland firefighters don’t lose $20k come October 1st.** Again, the political reality is that Congress ran out of time to avoid the pay cliff and legislation like this cannot simply be drafted and passed overnight. NFFE, Grassroots, and others will continue to lobby Congress to pass more comprehensive legislation, including Tim’s Act, moving forward. This will NOT be the end of pay reform, nor addressing other issues.

It is unlikely that folks will see their pay cut if this bill is passed. See the below graphic.

Sure, if the bill passes Congress will take credit, but look at what the fire community has been able to achieve the past few years. There is huge potential for major changes via future legislation. Congress understands that significant reform is necessary on top of this bill.

At the end of the day, you can either join your peers in advocating for improvements, or you can do nothing. Change will be much easier with collective action from the fire community as a whole. Be a part of the solution instead of sitting on the sidelines. What are you doing to help?

Hi everyone,

NFFE invites you to [write to your representatives in Congress to urge them to pass the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-congress-to-cosponsor-and-pass-the-wildland-firefighter-paycheck-protection-act?source=direct_link&). Thank you to those of you who have already written letters (over two thousand in just a few days).

We lobbied for this bill daily behind the scenes for over two months to help avoid the pay cliff this fall, BUT, we know it's still not enough. The reality is that certain members of Congress are opposed to spending in the federal sector, so it is far more feasible to pass smaller bills than everything we need at once. We are still lobbying for Tim's Act and encourage you to do the same. Moving forward, NFFE will also be lobbying for supplemental bills to permanently fix pay, including real pay parity in wages and portal to portal pay. We will also be bargaining with USFS and working on bills to address mental health, housing, and other issues. (We are also circulating a [survey on housing issues](https://forms.gle/x7UCWqQBNXpMYtCV6) to use for bargaining in the next couple weeks with the Forest Service.)

We know most all of you are fed up, and we are too. But we are doing everything we can, alongside Grassroots and other advocacy groups. It will take all everyone in the fire community if we are going to implement truly permanent solutions.

&#x200B;

The article presents a number of studies that have found an association between breathing the pollutants contained in wildfire smoke and suffering from worse mental health.  The mental health afflictions found to be more common in breathers of polluted air include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, self-harm, and suicide.  The relationship may be causal, although the biological mechanism involved is not known (inflammation and oxidative stress within the brain are suggested as plausible candidates).

The article is geared toward the general public, and firefighters are not mentioned.  But it got me thinking: maybe this is one contributing factor in the unusual prominence of depression and suicide in the wildland fire community.

These last few months have been a bit of a doozy. Last year I finished up my fourth season on a fed engine crew, and unfortunately I will not be returning, almost certainly for good. 

I had some issues with anxiety and depression stemming from a rough childhood throughout junior high and into early high school, but by the time I graduated I was pretty much good. It wasn't perfect, but I was on a med which was working pretty well, and it got to the point where I no longer felt the need to attend therapy as the meds seemed to be enough.

I got hired my first eligible season out of high school on a district that was basically entirely a super dry steppe out west. Despite this my first two seasons were mostly project work and a few small IAs. My third and fourth seasons I was off district for a good forty perfect of the time, and was able to spike out and do some WUI stuff in quite a few different states on some pretty large incidents. 

Despite some stressful times on rolls, it wasn't really the work that started getting to me, as it was the neglect of my own mental health with no work life balance. I would go back to the bunkhouse on my off days after rolls and after regular shifts and just sit there. I'd listen to podcasts and it wouldn't even register. No book could keep my attention. I was completely out of it, and if I wasn't working then I wasn't happy. The only thing that invigorated me was the job. If I wasn't working, I was thinking about going back to work. It's the only thing that really gave me any happiness, especially in that last season.

The season ended, and I went back east. I started looking for jobs and after a couple months I found a fuels crew job out west, and I was getting ready to head back. 

To date I have no idea how it flipped on me so quickly, but it was like half a decade of shoving down my emotions came crashing down in about a week. I was absolutely distraught, and I couldn't do a damn thing. Suicidal ideation unfortunately has happened on both sides of my family, and I regret to say that I was that low for a significant portion of my time. I finally told my uncle (who raised me, and for all intents and purposes is my father) everything, and being a CNA who had worked a bit in the psych ward, he took me to the emergency room. He knew how serious it was, and it was. Had he not been there, I probably would have jumped off a bridge.

I spent about a month in the psych ward. If you've ever seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest its honestly not that far off. Not the chaos, but the hours of heavily medicated people sitting in front of the television in a white room with scrubs. They tried some new medications on me, and I got lucky. Some people need years to find the right combo. For me it was only a matter of weeks.

I'm out now, and generally stable. I would probably be dead without the med combo I'm currently on. I have made a promise to myself to never return to fire. It's honestly shocking, but I never once felt anxiety on the job. I just got into this mindset where I was able to perfectly compartmentalize any and all feelings, and just focus on work. That being said, someone who has had as serious of anxiety attacks as me probably shouldn't be in emergency services. I never had a severe panic attack on the job, but if I do, I'm going to get somebody killed in a burnover. There is no way in good conscience that I could go back to my crew when the risk is that high.

Please note, that is NOT me saying that people with mental health issues should not be in fire. Some of the best firefighters I know opened up to me about overcoming addiction, mental health issues, rough relationships, and incarceration. Life's challenges often breed the strongest people. This is simply me saying that, knowing my current situation and mental history, I am no longer a suitable candidate for this job.

I'm looking for another job now, something less stressful. I got pretty good running a saw so I'm going to apply for one of the state parks or city Parks and Rec boards. Everyone I've talked to says you get to be outside make these spaces nicer for people to spend time in I did some trails work, so I think that I'm going to enjoy my future. It breaks my heart into a million pieces that I can't do fire anymore, but that's just something that I'll have to accept and move forward with.

Please, if you're experiencing anything like this, depression, anxiety, ptsd, doesn't matter, there is no alternative to healthcare. No amount of zyns, jack daniels and hours in the gym can compensate for the love and support of your family, therapy, and meds if you are determined to need them. Going to a doctor doesn't mean you need meds, just remember that. Everyone's case is different, and mental healthcare is a hell of a lot more these days than just shoving prozac down your throat. You never know what might work for you.

Health insurance is obviously a big issue with this position, and also obviously the biggest barrier to getting decent mental healthcare. I'd be willing to argue that most people reading this (if any of you have read this far) don't currently have a health plan as a default perk of your employer. That being said, there are options. It would obviously be a big change, but lots of state agencies give health insurance out to their wildland firefighters. I've met a few people with ODF who say one of their primary reasons for staying with the state of Oregon is the pretty decent health plan that they get.

Furthermore, since most of us here are still getting paid peanuts as seasonal employees, lots of us qualify for some okayish prices on health insurance plans. My home state of Arkansas has a state run health insurance marketplace that I got my plan through. It's Arkansas, so the program isn't great compared to other states, but I was able to pull off a half decent plan from it that isn't completely batshit in price. Lots of other states have something similar, and also have people whose sole job is to help clients sign up for them. Do some digging, you never know what you might find.

TL:DR Take care of your mental health, American healthcare sucks, but it can be okayish if you get lucky like me.

Hopefully someone can relate to my circumstance here.

I’m a 19 y/o male and just finished my week of classes to become an FFT2. Firefighting has been a job I wanted to try ever since seeing local wildland firefighters put out a mountain fire where I used to live in Arizona, and I was going to do it last summer, but ultimately decided against it due to the fact that I had just started a wonderful relationship that I wasn’t prepared to leave for an entire summer. 

Throughout my entire week of classes, I felt like I didn’t belong. You see, although fire was something I want to do for the challenge, help to environment, and money, I am in no way what you would call a blue collar type person, or someone who has worked at a physical labor job before. My background is in the arts such as writing and performing. I love nerdy things like anime and video games and books. But at the same time, I enjoy camping and working out. 

Almost everyone during my classes, crew-bosses included, were very much the opposite of myself. During the class, especially during the field day, my anxiety crept in as I felt like I never fit in with any of these people and that I wouldn’t be good at the job. The way everyone communicated was loud, blunt, and direct—-something I’m not used to. As a rather quiet, sensitive person, it has been hard to remind myself that the way these people talk isnt meant to be a jab against me, or anything personal. They even said that everyone fails at the beginning, but learns a lot throughout their first few days on dispatch.

As it stands, then, I’m just terrified of my first deployment. I didn’t realize how much thought went into this work. It’s not just being told what to do then doing it. I need to know how fire behavior works, how to construct a proper line, do hose lays, etc. I can’t just turn my mind off and dig. Communication was something I struggled with during my field day, and I don’t want to become a laughing stock on the fireline because I dont know what to do, or be seen as “weak” by my fellow crewmen. But at the same time, I WANT to do this work to prove to myself that I can do something scary, something uncomfortable. That I can push myself through unfamiliar environments and help the earth and get paid to do so. 

So then, I ask, any advice for guys like me? Anyone out there who was in a similar boat to me? Do things get better after the first few days on deployment? Do people get pissed at you for not meeting expectations your first time around?

As the deadline to avoid a severe pay cliff for federal wildland firefighters approaches, the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) is focusing on House and Senate [leadership](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/05/politics/congress-wrestles-over-firefighter-pay/index.html) to pass critical legislation by the end of the month. If funding is not approved by Congress by September 30th, federal wildland firefighters will see their base pay cut by 50 percent, up to $20,000.

Union officials and wildland firefighters are meeting with members of Congress next week to lobby support for the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act (WFPPA) and the Tim Hart Wildland Firefighter Classification and Pay Parity Act (Tim’s Act). Both pieces of legislation would permanently increase pay for federal wildland firefighters and help avert a wave of mass resignations within an already understaffed workforce.

Facing a potential government shutdown, Congress is saddled with several other significant political [issues](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/firefighter-health/) that have taken priority over increasing spending to protect wildland firefighter wages, such as aid for the war in Ukraine and natural disaster relief funding. With those spending concerns, as well as legislation to avoid the pay cliff for wildland firefighters, it is critical that House Republicans join their colleagues to approve additional funding.

“We are incredibly close to an absolute disaster for not only our wildland firefighters, but the country as a whole,” said NFFE National President Randy Erwin. “If Congress allows this pay cliff to happen, the federal government will not have a workforce to protect our lands from the wildfire crisis. Communities will burn and people will die. NFFE and wildland firefighters across the country have worked tirelessly over the past year to have legislation introduced to avoid this catastrophe. Congressional leaders, especially House Republicans, must listen to their constituents and understand that their inaction on this issue will be devastating. Congress must pass a bill to avoid the pay cliff before it is too late.”",,,Wildfire,NFFE Targets Leadership in Congress to Pass Wildland Firefighter Pay Cliff Bill,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/16cn9sg/nffe_targets_leadership_in_congress_to_pass/

I explained that this is out of my hands and for what it's worth, some of them are duds.

&#x200B;

Am I right to keep some of these guys on the forest? I consistently have to tell them to turn off the hot shot wakeup podcast so we can start briefing, and they tell me that he has the real inside info that the sitreport can't provide. Everyday in PT I attempt to implement a robust calisthenics program, but they ignore me and bench press because ""it's what hot shots do"". One of my firefighters always yells ""HEY"" at me and when I don't respond he yells ""HEY"" even louder. When I finally ask what he wants he just stares at me. It's really scary. Today we were on patrol and he freaked out at me when I said we couldn't stop at Qdoba. He thought I was joking but then gave me the silent treatment while simultaneously slamming his head into the seat when I drove past the restaurant. I literally cannot stand coming to work anymore. I told one of my firefighters that I was buying a new car and he told me that it was a bad idea because I need to build credit up and that I might want to go to college for a second degree. When I rolled into work with a new truck they all laughed at me and said that a real man would've bought a two door manual. Everyday this guy complains about how he had benefits at his old job at Taco Bell and I think him and the rest of the crew are going to work there next year. I got squad wiped by Taco Bell.

Does anybody have advice on how to break through to these guys? Or are they just stupid?

Lulu_lu_who,,,,1693709570,,,168ll9a,,,,,,t3_168ll9a,4,,/r/Wildfire/comments/168ll9a/wfppa_congressional_engagement/,,,,"Hey y’all. I shared this in another thread regarding Congressional engagement surrounding the WFPPA. 

If all you can do is write a form letter, do that. But if you possibly can, call your congressional delegation and speak to their constituent liaison. 

A phone call is going to hit their radar much higher than a form letter or even a personal email. 

You can look up your Congress members here:
https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member. 

You can call their DC office or find local office contact information, usually in the “Office 
Locations” or “Contact” section. Sometimes it’s as easy as scrolling to the bottom of their 
website.

Tips for your phone call:
1. Call during business hours and on the weekdays; sometime office are not staffed on 
Friday afternoons.
2. Identify yourself as a constituent of the Congress member
3. Tell whoever answers the call that you’re calling to find out what the Congressperson’s 
position is on the WFPPA (have the bill numbers handy in case they need those S.2272 and H.R. 5169).
4. If they support it, ask them what they’re doing to ensure it gets passed before the 
deadline. Acknowledge that they might not serve on the committee it’s being vetted 
through but emphasize the tight deadline and the need for it to be prioritized (if it’s 
important to a lot of Congress members, they will make sure it gets scheduled quickly).
Ask them to sign on as a cosponsor. 
5. Have talking points ready to educate your Congressional office if they’re unaware of the 
issue. 
a. Highlight the 50%/$20,000 cut in pay, that 30-50% of firefighters are considering 
quitting and that this poses a safety risk for WFFs and the communities they 
serve.
b. Let them know the bill has bipartisan support and has companion bills in both 
chambers.
c. Emphasize that this will protect equitable pay for a dangerous and demanding 
job.
6. Make it personal; let them know that you will be personally impacted and how.
a. Express gratitude for the incentive pay and share what quality of life it’s given
b. Tell them what you’ll lose if you lose the incentive pay; share the same things you 
shared in the letter you wrote.
7. Don’t bring up extemporaneous factors not included by the bill (things like improved 
mental health, housing, etc. are important but not going to be addressed by the WFPPA).
8. Urge the Congressperson’s support of the bill.
9. Thank them for their time.

Some of the partners of WFF who are engaged on this issue are working on making sure resources are accessible and posting them all here:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c3zz0bitkp7281p/AAAX1hL9rqX4xf4Vx9VPjzxPa?dl=0

There’s also a group headed to DC in mid-September and we’ve been advised to bring hand written and signed letters. We’re also getting a dropbox upload link set up if you’d like to write a letter, take a picture of it and upload it. They’ll get printed and hand delivered.

NFFE spends more time on reddit and other social media accounts than IAFF and has nothing to show for it.

NFFE is an afl-cio union, which means that as long as we are 'represented' by NFFE, we will never be allowed to join/form another union under the threat of NFFE suing the competing union. NFFE has claimed in this very subreddit that they work closely with IAFF, and yet I know for a fact that most of the people running IAFF have legitimately never even heard of NFFE. Might have something to do with the fact that IAFF is a firefighters union, wheras NFFE is an aircraft mechanics union that has grown into a disgusting overgrown monster representing far too many employees and departments to ever be able to focus on us and our individual needs.
IAFF recently secured 'forever pay raises' for calfire, you know, the people who were already making twice as much money as us 'forestry techs'.

What federal firefighters need is a federal firefighters union.

I wanted to talk to some climate scientists & fire fighters about an idea I've been working on. I've built a weather station that can reliably send data from a forest (using LoRa) every minute on:

* Temperature
* Pressure
* Wind Speed/Direction
* Soil Moisture/Temperature
* Smoke detection
* Tree sap flow/tree diameter (if desired)
* Fuels level detection using Machine Learning (if desired)

So basically a RAWS device with more bells & whistles, but it cost me \~$300 to make (top 5 bullets).

I've talked to a few people at Dept of Forestry, but it seems like there's a lot of hesitation to adopt new technologies that can potentially produce false-positives, which is why I want to try and hop on a government grant... but then it seems like there's hesitation since I'm structured as a for-profit company.  


Before I start build a web-application that would combine this data with remote-sensing data, I wanted to get people's input on if this would even useful?

I'm a rookie looking at two agencies to take a job. I am about to decide between working for the ODF and the feds, and I've got a few questions about the differences between the two. I have heard that the ODF is focused on full suppression of fires, no prescribed burns, mainly there to protect timber stock. The station that I'm talking to for the feds is actively out doing Rx burns, and seems to be pretty pro-responsible fire management (not that I've heard negative things about the ODF per se). I was just wondering what some of your perspectives on this were, and if anybody has experience with both/either I would love to learn more.

&#x200B;

I was also curious about pay over a season. I'd be a GS-03 (or whatever the lowest is for the state if I work there), and the fed station I'd be working at is understaffed so I could get a lot of overtime - not sure about the ODF station. Is there much of a discrepancy in pay working for either one of them?

My question is simple: I'd really rather not lose a job offer because I piss hot due to the presence of said benzo that has been prescribed to me by a doctor. I would bring these concerns to my FMO but I'd rather not start my job by saying something to the effect of ""hey boss, I get anxious sometimes and take an FDA approved medication for it instead of coping in ways that are more USDA friendly, ie alienating friends and family by crushing a 30 rack of Coors Banquet and chugging half a fifth of jim beam.""

My department has only dealt with one pregnant women before and she was fighting to stay in full duty till her 3rd trimester. 
I’m fully against that since with wildland we don’t have scba’s, no way around carrying a loaded pack, tools ect. And my biggest worry is the increased exposure of smoke, excessive heat and heavy stress will lead to a miscarriage. There’s so little data we have about firefighting and pregnancy and none of it is good news. Firefighters have a significantly higher miscarriage rate compared to the average population.

I’m one of few officers on my department that runs a crew full time. So if I get a Dr note say light duty asap my boss is going to flip fucking shit. Even though i have preexisting conditions that will already make me high risk. I fully expect this one individual will hinder me ever going back to full time. Especially if this where to all happen in the middle of the season.

How do I go about convincing my chiefs that light duty asap as a option should be a choice? While not trying to seem lazy or like a bitch. Not just for me but because we don’t know the full risks yet but what we do know is alarming.",,,Wildfire,Pregnancy Policies?,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/119rsy0/pregnancy_policies/

I’d quip, “I’ve lived four lifetimes; none of which was my body designed”. Laughingly saying, “I’ll worry about it when I’m old”.

Guess what, I’m old now and my body is trashed. My joints, my muscles, my bones are just, worked. Beat to shit. Double knee replacement is not far out and I’m only 56. 

I bought the ticket & took the ride. 

Wouldn’t have it any other way. My life is about trade-offs, risk:reward ratio and my satisfaction of “sending it”.

For y’all, start early with damage control, if you’re not willing to pay the price later. It’s really challenging being in pain ALL THE TIME!!’

The good Dr. once wrote:

Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming ""Wow! What a Ride!”

I fully embraced this prophecy. However, the only worrying detail is the cumulative brain damage from more concussions than I care to (or able) remember.

I have not received the letter telling me to schedule a drug test but I just found out it will be in the next couple of weeks, then 3 days to take it.

Should I tell the person hiring me that I will not pass the test if I take in the next week? Do they have any power to assist me? I assumed the test would be in person in a few months like when I worked for other agencies. Boy was I wrong! Thanks.

Update/advice: So I finally took my drug test and passed. I am 6 foot 160lbs, so fairly lean. I would first suggest that moving your appointment by saying you are out of town, working away from the address listed, after they schedule an appointment. Take the time you need to clear your system. Work out as much as you are comfortable with until 3 days before. So do not work out on monday if your appointment is on tuesday but sunday is fine. Also drink a little more water than usual during the time you stop smoking and the test. On top of that I would recommend Detoxify precleanse capsules. They're most impactful ingredeants are creatinine monohydrate and b12. A pack for 6 days is about 6 bucks; less expensive than buying a full bottle of b12 and creatinine. This stuff lets you drink more water before the drug test, so your sample will be dilluted but the stuff in precleanse will make it pass without looking dilluted when tested.

HighFlight51,,,,1692545982,,,15wemvq,,,,,,t3_15wemvq,200,,/r/canada/comments/15wemvq/how_to_increase_enlistment_in_volunteer_fire/,,,," As  a former member of the military, and a former volunteer firefighter after that, and now a longstanding volunteer with various community groups,  I  just don't get it.  Why are so few young Canadians attracted to the idea  of service above self, and the prospect of doing exciting, demanding,  and immensely rewarding jobs?  Do they need to be asked to step up?

This  past week various news outlets have reported on multiple recruitment  crises in front-line agencies. Volunteer fire departments are down some  30,000 volunteers from a previous high.  The RCMP and other police  services across the country are struggling to meet recruitment targets.   And the military is vastly under-strength (by 16,000 members) and is  not attracting anywhere near the numbers needed to meet the needs of its  various missions.

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/volunteer-firefighter-shortage-new-brunswick-1.6865721](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/volunteer-firefighter-shortage-new-brunswick-1.6865721)

[https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/canadian-armed-forces-facing-member-shortage-crisis-1.6344761](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/canadian-armed-forces-facing-member-shortage-crisis-1.6344761)

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-duheme-recruitment-1.6937969](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-duheme-recruitment-1.6937969)

It's  commonplace for the news media to cast blame for these problems on poor  working conditions, scandals and under-funding, but are those  explanations adequate?  Recruitment campaigns all seem to take the  approach of appealing to the selfish gene: join us: here is what we  offer you!  No-one these days is appealing to the notion of service  above self.  No-one is asking the younger generation to step up,  shoulder some of the burden, or do their duty.   We just NEVER hear that  kind of thing anymore.

What gives, Canada?  What needs to change?

>OPP say people should avoid engaging with members of biker gangs after violence broke out between two rival motorcycle clubs in eastern Ontario this week.

The situation is serious enough that the OPP is even cautioning people not to wear gang-related clothing, as it could make them targets of biker violence.

Saturday evening, police say a fight between two biker gangs in Cornwall, Ont., the Outlaws and the Loners, left three people injured, two with stab wounds and another with gunshot wounds.

Less than two days later, the Outlaws hangout in Brockville, Ont., was severely burned in a fire that spread to nearly a dozen other homes in the area, police said.

This is why Wade and the OPP’s biker gang unit thought it best to ask the community to avoid wearing gang paraphernalia at this time.

They are criminal organizations.”",,,canada,‘Do not approach’: OPP warn public as biker gang violence erupts in eastern Ontario | Globalnews.ca,0.96,https://globalnews.ca/news/9824546/do-not-approach-opp-warn-public-as-biker-gang-violence-erupts-in-eastern-ontario/

In the 156 years since Confederation, our country has experienced great change and growth. Today we celebrate the country we all are fortunate enough to call home.

The last couple of years have been extremely challenging for many Canadians. While last year we saw a return to in-person and community celebrations, this year, thousands of Canadians are now being impacted by wildfires removing them from their homes and communities. As you celebrate, think of those who are unable to enjoy the weekend and who remain impacted. Please also look to your local fire and firework restrictions to ensure you are safe and responsible. While we might not be able to celebrate Canada Day in the ways we are used to – we are still incredibly lucky to live in a beautiful country that offers us so much incredible natural beauty and amazing people.

​

Throughout the weekend, the moderation will be relaxed to allow more content to be shared. Please share your Canadiana, your experiences, and how you are choosing to spend your Canada Day weekend. We encourage you to share here in this thread, or in your own posts, all of your long weekend traditions and experiences in our great country.

As many Canadians will choose to celebrate Canada Day, we must also respect those who choose to reflect on Canada’s past treatment of indigenous people. Every individual will make their own choice as to how they will spend their Canada Day, and we should be respectful of each other. We would all benefit from understanding our past and our country's relationship with the Indigenous people of Canada.

Regardless of how you choose to spend your Canada Day, please be safe and drink (or smoke) responsibly.

​On behalf of the entire moderation team, have a safe, healthy, and happy Canada Day!

Bonne fête du Canada r/Canada !

Au cours des 156 années qui se sont écoulées depuis la Confédération, notre pays a connu de grands changements et une grande croissance. Aujourd'hui, nous célébrons le pays que nous avons tous la chance d'appeler chez nous.

Les deux dernières années ont été extrêmement difficiles pour de nombreux Canadiens. Alors que l'année dernière, nous avons vu un retour aux célébrations en personne et communautaires, cette année, des milliers de Canadiens sont maintenant touchés par des incendies de forêt qui les chassent de leurs maisons et de leurs communautés. Pendant que vous célébrez, pensez à ceux qui ne peuvent pas profiter du week-end et qui restent touchés. Veuillez également consulter les restrictions locales en matière d'incendie et de feux d'artifice pour vous assurer que vous êtes en sécurité et responsable. Bien que nous ne puissions peut-être pas célébrer la fête du Canada comme nous en avons l'habitude, nous sommes toujours incroyablement chanceux de vivre dans un beau pays qui nous offre une beauté naturelle incroyable et des gens incroyables.

​

Tout au long du week-end, la modération sera assouplie pour permettre de partager plus de contenu. Veuillez partager votre Canadiana, vos expériences et comment vous choisissez de passer votre week-end de la fête du Canada. Nous vous encourageons à partager ici dans ce fil, ou dans vos propres messages, toutes vos traditions et expériences de long week-end dans notre grand pays.

Comme de nombreux Canadiens choisiront de célébrer la fête du Canada, nous devons également respecter ceux qui choisissent de réfléchir au traitement passé des peuples autochtones par le Canada. Chaque personne fera son propre choix quant à la façon dont elle passera sa fête du Canada, et nous devons nous respecter les uns les autres. Nous gagnerions tous à comprendre notre passé et la relation de notre pays avec les peuples autochtones du Canada.

""Agok (one of 3 shooters) faces charges of carrying a concealed weapon, possessing drugs for trafficking and failing to comply with a release order""

""Agok was under court orders not to leave his house, possess weapons or associate with McIntyre (another one of the 3 shooters) at the time of his arrest, according to court documents that listed the drugs seized Friday as fentanyl, cocaine and oxycodone""

Both out on bail, or house arrest, from previous firearm and drug related offences that took place only 1 year ago. They are under court orders to not associate with each other and are under a weapons prohibiton. Both still associate and get guns illegally and get into a shootout. 

The removal of the mandatory minimum sentencing for firearm related offences, with the additon of bail reform has only further insentavised criminals and puts them back on our streets to continue commiting crimes. My home town, London, has seen an unprecedented 11 shootings in just 4 months. 

The London Police Service shows on their website a statistic comparison of crimes commited for the years 2017-2021. In 2017 violent crimes (assault, sexual assault, robbery, attempt murder & murder) shows 2,148 charges laid. In 2021 is shows 3,142 charges laid. 2022 was a bad year for crime and i imagine the stats would follow the upward trend. And so far, 2023 is already beating out 2022. I don't feel safe in my city. The government needs to wake up and address the real issues to reduce crime. 

Go after the illegal gun market instead of spending billions of tax payer dollars and police resources on law abiding citizen gun owners. Instead put that money into CBSA to better equip them in stopping illegal guns from entering. Put that money into addressing the mental health and housing crisis. The rates of homelessness, mental health and addictions is stagering in London, we are drowning. 

They need to de-centivise criminals by bringing back mandatory sentencing for firearm related offences. They need to revamp their bail system so we dont waste police resources arresting the same person 2-3 times a day. 

This is a massive issue that is happening all across our country. Im fearful for the future if nothing meaningful is done to address the crime rates in this country.",,,canada,"Police charge two men with attempted murder, seek third in core shootout",0.73,https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/two-men-charged-in-downtown-shootout-police-seek-third

Like many of you, we have only just begun to learn and understand the depth and breadth of the mistreatment of Indigenous children at residential schools under a government policy of assimilation. A recent, dark, and tragic period in our Canadian story that we have a responsibility to face with open minds, humility, and compassion to improve our understanding, learn, and be part of the process of healing.

Today offers a continued opportunity for all members of the subreddit to pause, recognize, and reflect on the malicious legacy of residential schools. Please, seize the opportunity by participating and learning for the betterment of our society.

**Opportunities to participate:**

* Both the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation and Orange Shirt Day take place today. Orange Shirt Day is an Indigenous-led, grassroots commemorative day that honours the children who survived Indian Residential Schools and remembers those who did not.
* There are various sacred Fires and Vigils in cities across the country that are held from sunrise to sunset today. We encourage you to seek out one in yours to respectfully participate in.
* CBC is hosting a series of Indigenous-led programming for television and radio audiences.  Links and details for these programs and offerings can be found [here](https://www.cbc.ca/arts/how-to-watch-and-listen-to-national-day-for-truth-and-reconciliation-2022-on-cbc-1.6595830)

Just this morning my fiancé and I had to cancel our wedding for the 31st in the interior due to the fires. We're obviously pretty bummed about this, but we still wanted to get married on the 31st and do something very small locally.  


We're just looking for small spaces (around 30 people) or even parks that we could go to for a quick ceremony in or around Vancouver. If anyone knows of any potential spaces around the lower mainland that they would recommend it would be helpful. Also looking for any recommendations for a local officiant to help with our last minute change in plans.

Thanks in advance from a stressed engaged couple


Update:
My fiancé and I have managed to find a beautiful venue for our wedding. We’ve scheduled almost the entire wedding from scratch in around 72 hours.

The fire department has come by once already, and put it out the first time. I don’t know if the pallets were here then. The second time it was a tenant that put it out.

This is absolutely fucking ridiculous and if this building catches fire, there is going to be a lot of seniors and young working people homeless. It is ridiculous that in this housing crisis, we have somebody motivated to make even more people homeless. This city needs to do something because this is just absurd.

We are living in a concrete condo built in 2020. During the annual dryer vent cleaning (*our first one as it's our first year moved into this building... really not sure how this was not discovered by previous owners. Building manager said this year the contractor has been doing a very thorough job*) that our dryer vent isn't connected to anything, there is no hole for any of this hot air to escape and instead has been trapped inside a cavity in our condo... What the heck. We've noticed that our condo can get warm (but not uncomfortably warm) when we use the dryer but we offset this by turning on the central AC. Thought it was fairly normal.

Contractor and everyone I spoke too said this is shocking and extremely rare, spoke to residents who are concerned as well as this could be a fire hazard. Has ANYBODY dealt with a similar situation? What is the approach here? Emailed the developer and strata has been notified but feeling extremely anxious to get this rectified. If this is a building code violation, who is liable?

We have no idea if a channel has been drilled in the concrete or not for ventilation. Balcony shows there are two vents.

It does sound like this is not in compliance with the BC Building Code. Do violations like these get taken seriously if reported? I believe the channel is to report with our City (City of Richmond).

TLDR: We have a terrible shortage of housing, especially affordable housing. The province has agreed to build three non-market rental buildings in False Creek North, including two high-rises, with a total of 650 apartments. The city still needs to say yes. There's a public hearing Thursday afternoon, and there’s significant opposition (27 comments opposed, 3 in support). If you'd like to counterbalance the opposition (or if you're also opposed!), it takes literally 60 seconds to [submit a comment](https://vancouver.ca/your-government/contact-council-public-hearing.aspx). It can be as simple as ""I support this plan."" Just set the Subject to ""False Creek North Non-Market Housing.""

&#x200B;

[Non-market housing is planned for sites 3, 4, and 5](https://preview.redd.it/74qqp7xoqjbb1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=054d0af5af81e16645246abdfa2a17b5c52aa13c)

When False Creek North (the former Expo Lands) was being planned for redevelopment, the goal was always to have it be mixed-income, with 20% non-market homes. Over the last two or three decades there's been 540 non-market homes built (I think a bit less than half of the target), but there were long delays in getting anything else built.

The city of Vancouver announced in February that it had reached an agreement with Concord Pacific to acquire three sites in False Creek North for non-market housing, between Granville Bridge and Cambie Bridge. BC Housing will build a 28-storey building, a 29-storey building, and a seven-storey building, all with non-market housing. The proposal also includes a new fire hall and a daycare. There'll be a total of about 650 homes.

You sometimes hear housing skeptics say, ""We don't need more housing, we need more *affordable* housing."" They're wrong (we need both!), but it's certainly true that there’s a huge shortage of housing that’s affordable to people with regular jobs.

There's limits to how much non-market housing you can build, because unlike market housing, it requires public subsidy (typically contributions of land or capital). But when there's an opportunity to get 650 non-market homes built, with construction fully funded by the province, it seems like a good idea to take it.

The target is that 30% will be ""low end of market"" (helping to cross-subsidize the lower-income apartments, but run on a non-profit basis), 50% will be lower-income (household income below a certain threshold), and 20% will be ""deeply affordable"" (shelter/pension rate). The lower-income thresholds are: annual household income of up to $58,000 for a 1BR or studio, $72,000 for 2BR, $86,000 for 3BR. 25% of the apartments will be 2BR or 3BR, so suitable for families. 

Because these are non-market rather than market, I expect there’ll be an application process to apply for them. (For an example of what this might look like, see the application process for [Catalyst Community Development’s rental buildings](https://catalystcommdev.org/rent-with-us/).) But for renters (more than half of Vancouverites), this helps even if you’re not living there yourself: when there’s 650 renter households who are living in non-market rentals, that’s 650 fewer households competing for market rentals. When we’re trying to drive up the vacancy rate, everything helps.

Thing is, **non-market housing runs into exactly the same obstacles as market housing**. The city’s zoning is quite restrictive, and actually allowing BC Housing to build these projects requires the city to change its laws. So there’s been several months of public consultation, and now a rezoning hearing Thursday afternoon. It looks like there’ll be a fair amount of opposition.

Confusingly, the city’s term for non-market housing aimed at lower-income households is “social housing,” but it also has an entirely separate category for “supportive housing,” i.e. housing for people who are homeless or destitute. This is non-market, mixed-income housing, not supportive housing. Reading through the comments from opponents, a lot of people talk about “increased criminal burden.” I think they’re imagining that this will be supportive housing.

Comments from opponents:

* I'm concerned my view of False Creek will be blocked, and feel that the space could be better used as a park. 
* The initial plan to build 8 storey buildings was what drove us to buy at 930 Cambie Street. This updated plan is jeopardizing the value of our condo and obliterating the views of False Creek we currently enjoy. This change of plan is unacceptable. 
* An excessively large development could lead to overcrowding, increased traffic congestion, limited parking spaces, and decreased privacy for residents. Such negative impacts would compromise the character and charm of our community, potentially diminishing property values and causing distress to current homeowners.
* This project will obviously damage Yaletown and increase the criminal burden of our communities!
* Social housing needs to be balanced with market housing to integrate all members of society, to ensure integration, diversity and safety. Having 2 large high rises concentrated in one small area risks creating an area that is no longer safe for tourists on the False Creek walkway, children and families in Cooper's Park.

- Decriminalize small possession of all drugs
- Government approval/licensing process for drug manufacturers and distributors (safe supply with no fentanyl, tranq, etc., warning labels, ethical/legal source materials, 19+, taxation, etc.)
- Drug usage only in private residences, SRO’s, approved locations away from schools, tourist sites, shops, restaurants, bars, etc.
- Massive spend on drug addiction and mental health treatment facilities/options, with huge incentives to use these (employment opportunities, criminal record reduction, child care, better housing, etc.)
- Ban on unapproved homeless encampments, sidewalk tent villages, etc., with accompanied spend on housing (with mental health, addiction counseling and heavy police presence).
- Big spend on policing. Arrests for public disturbance, dangerous littering and usage in unapproved areas (includes parks, streets, Chinatown and alleyways). Teams of police responsible for forced relocations of homeless from encampments into housing, with enrollment into treatment and mental health options.
- Big spend on public education of what help, treatment and accompanied incentives are available and how to enroll. Public awareness campaigns for teaching drug use side effects - aimed mostly at youth, to possibly dissuade them from starting (this seemed to work for tobacco smoking, and most recently alcohol).

The compassionate part of me hates a lot of this list, but the rational part of me thinks it’s needed. Thoughts?

I should add, that I view the drug crisis homeless and the un-addicted homeless as somewhat separate populations with different solutions. For both groups, I think the government needs to have Roosevelt-level public works spending to train the working class unemployed to build massive infrastructure to address flooding/forest fire/climate change. Heck the rich folks of Vancouver will gladly fork over their tax dollars for training a million forest fire fighters alone, and these jobs will be in every city and town across BC!",,,vancouver,Vancouver’s Drug Crisis - some possible solutions,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/14pxabm/vancouvers_drug_crisis_some_possible_solutions/

I think I speak for literally everyone when I say we do not want yet another year of out of control wildfires. It's inevitable that we'll get some that won't be human caused, but it's everyone's duty to be responsible for themselves.

That being said, here are some things you can do to minimize the risk of starting a fire:

* Don't toss cigarette butts out the car window or carelessly onto the ground. If you see your friend do this, PLEASE call them out on it. Be that stick in the mud. Remind everyone you hang out with that it's irresponsible.

* Obey local/provincial fire bans. Look, I know some people really really like bonfires out by the lake or whatever.. but all it takes is one ember to fly off in the wind and land on a patch of dry grass for disaster to strike. Your desire to have a bonfire at the lake does not override nearby residents' right to not have their homes burn down.

* Get familiar with how to use fire extinguishers and carry some with you if you go out RVing/camping. Look up YouTube videos if you need to, ask/show your friends how to do it. It's never a bad idea to familiarize yourself with this invaluable tool.

* Report any dangerous fire activities to authorities. See some drunk college kids being reckless with a bonfire? Call it in. See a fire started by a lightning strike? Call it in. The sooner it's known about, the sooner firefighters can act.

* Know when to use water to put out a fire and when not to. Anyone who's been a cook knows you should never use water to put out a grease fire. Cutting off oxygen is the key, as that is the fuel for most fires. Throw dirt on it, use an extinguisher, or cover the fire with a lid if it's small enough.

I want to enjoy this summer as much as the rest of you do. Please feel free to add more fire safety tips and remember to tell your friends to be responsible.

The email (from the stranger) did not have any back up as to their charges, and the wording sounded very emotional and sensationalized. 

*""Please boycott JJ Bean.  They are being sued in the Supreme Court of BC""*

...but I can’t find such a filing.

  
It went on to describe an:  
*""employee who chews on a toothpick and wears her baseball cap backwards and looks like a pitbull” ""Then she even made him leave.""*

Really? They want to bash a female employee for her style? 

It didn’t explain the situation in which apparently the *“middle eastern man”* was asked to leave, only a bunch of emotional words and a statement that the CEO was evil because they supported his employee. The business apparently has video footage. I’m happy for it to get subpoenaed there and get worked out there instead of trial by on-line emotional rants hurting a BC business.

*""And why is the CEO unwilling to watch the video of the middle-eastern man being (verbally) attacked and slandered by JJ Bean employees?  Does he condone a white-power female attacking a middle-eastern man who chews on a toothpick and wheres a baseball cap BACKWARDS !?!""*

Um...maybe if it’s heading to court they are preparing to show the video there as opposed to responding to unreasonable attacks? The email states that the CEO is *""either a ""proud boy"", or simply a lawless and unprofessional nutjob.  See the Picture attached of him.”* (the photo seems like a nice, smiling normal young guy??)

*""By the way.  Were you aware that in February the JJ Bean Burrard location all of sudden went up in flames?  Many say that is Karma or divine justice.  Picture attached.”* 

They posted “Karma” memes suggesting the business deserves the explosion/fire. That's just mean, imo.

I call bullshit, but interested if anyone knows anything that was clearly not shared in the emotional rant.

Numbers were actually pretty good - along with this, it was a nice mild sunny day so I had my first day this year riding in a t-shirt and shorts, and I saw many others doing the same. A perfect day for CM really. We started off at the art gallery, as usual, and then headed along Hornby towards the Granville bridge, where we stopped for a minute to let everyone catch up and do a chicago bike hold-up. Then we proceeded onto Broadway for a few km, going back on the Cambie bridge, and then after some riding along W Georgia the mass decided to go over the Burrard bridge onto Cornwall Ave, where a 5 year old was seriously injured by a speeding car this past summer. After this, we headed back onto Broadway and ended the ride at Olympic Village, so we did around 30km more or less.

I really liked how the mass decided to focus their attention on routes that had sub-par or non-existent bike infrastructure; biking on Broadway and seeing all the bikes and shops around me without having to worry about being hit by a car was a pretty euphoric feeling. Along with Cornwall Ave, where community members have been advocating for lower speed limits as it passes through pedestrian heavy vibrant neighbourhoods - and of course, again, a 5 year old kid was almost killed by a speeding car while she was standing on the sidewalk.

Overall morale was pretty good, I'd say. Most drivers were very supportive and we got a nice stream of friendly honks going for quite a while. There wasn't really any antagonizing of drivers or starting fights for no reason - everyone was just there to have their voices heard, and to have fun. And yes, we did let road cyclists pass, for the naysayers.

Of course, when you have a big enough mass, you've gotta start corking - and I was one of the corkers for about half of the red lights we passed through. 99% of the time, drivers simply waited patiently for the mass to pass through the intersection, which we were very thankful for. There was only one time where a taxi driver started laying on his horn and yelling, and we simply responded with clapping and positivity. Remember, corking allows the entire mass to clear the intersection faster than if we had split up into multiple groups, and it keeps people safer as cars aren't trying to force their way through the group. If you ever get caught in a CM, please be patient - I'm sure you're able to wait a minute.

There was one time where a fire truck was zoomin down the road and it was almost like Moses parting the sea, the way a hundred people all moved over to the right at the same time in order to clear a lane to let them through. Ironically, because of us, the fire truck most likely made it to its destination quicker than if the street had been filled up with cars all trying to get out of the way.

There were also two times on Broadway where some idiots in luxury SUVs decided to cross the yellow line into *oncoming traffic* in order to pass the mass and there was one instance where they got trapped by an oncoming car and had to sort of force-merge their way back into our lanes. It's very telling where motorists' priorities are when they'll happily wait in rush hour traffic twice a day five days a week, but as soon as they get delayed for 5 minutes by anyone who isn't in a car, they'll start performing dangerous maneuvers and using their vehicle as a weapon to force their way past other people. We're just as entitled to the road as much as they are. When people go ""but you don't need bike lanes on broadway!!11!11"", this is literally a prime example of why we do. Cars and bikes just don't mix well.

It was a great feeling to take back our streets for a few hours. I'm totally headed to next month's ride and I hope to see some of you there as well.",,,vancouver,Critical Mass Ride Report (April),0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1335uu6/critical_mass_ride_report_april/

Our birds are delightful, hilarious and add a lot to our local communities. They're also nesting right now! If you want to help them out this year, here's a list of things to be aware of that'll make their lives easier.

&#x200B;

* Cats. Cats decimate bird populations. Truly, birds have little chance against even the laziest indoor/outdoor feline (lookin' at you, Earl). Bells do not work very well. Google ""coloured cat collars"" and consider putting one on your cat. Yes, they'll look like an (even more) deranged member of the Insane Clown Posse, but they'll murder less. And less murder is good. Or keep them inside. Just for Spring. They'll live. The birds probably will not.
* Keep dogs on-leash in on-leash areas. Many forest trails, particularly in the North Shore, are on-leash. Birds nest both low and high, and when your dog goes traipsing through bushes they may be unintentionally stomping on bird nests. Their energy freaks birds out, too, so even if your bud didn't step on anything, it might have scared mom so bad that she won't return to her eggs.
* Do not -- ever-- put mouse traps out in the open. You ever see a bird, probably a crow, with a smashed top-beak? Mouse trap. Let's apply some empathy. ""Oh, hey, cool, cheese"" -- SLAM. ""OW! WHY?"" Beak broken forever. It doesn't grow back. Your crow friends laugh at you. You have to sleep on the lower branches and you get pooped on at night. If you must trap your mice, please use a box -- that's what they're for! Open traps are brutal bird killers.
* Put reflective stickers on your windows. Birds smash into them all the time and it's very sad. If they aren't killed outright, often time they're concussed and easy prey (see #1). My partner and I saw a mother Flicker teaching her babies about glass by having them try to fly into it for an afternoon. It blew us away and broke our hearts; they're so much smarter than we think. 
* Clean your feeders and fountains. If you have them, please keep them clean. While we were slammed with COVID, our local birds were slammed with Avian Pox. It was gruesome... We suffer together, truly; clean food and water for them means healthier fledglings. 
* Pause any major yard work such as bush/tree removals until the second half of June. The sun makes us eager to get out there, but jumping in too early with the saw is a sure-fire way of freaking birds out. Naturally, planting local flowers and bushes helps our ecosystems, which benefits the birds.

I'm absolutely winter biased but I am genuinely curious why you summer lovers actively look forward to it.

My personal hate of summer stems from me being bad at regulating heat and when summers were mid to low 20s that was fine but now that 30 degrees is feeling like the norm I am in hell. My 3rd floor apartment has 3 massive west facing windows that absolutely get bathed in sunlight in the afternoon and just cook the hell out of our whole place. We have no sliding windows so the best I can do is get a dual hose AC that underperforms cause I can't properly seal the sliding door it sits in (old 70s ass apartment with shoddy doors) and we got blackout curtains last year that still only helped a bit. During the heat dome my girlfriend and I literally had to just leave the apartment one night cause it was actually unbearable. Heat means fires which means smoke so even if you like going out in the sun and heat odds are it's gonna be brown and hellish so whats the point?? I just spend 3 months sweaty, grumpy, worried about my cat, and unable to escape any oppresive heat. Very few buildings are built to deal with the heat (no AC, good at insulating heat) so it just feels like there is no escape. I can only get so naked and absolutely drenched in wet towels.

Sure winter is dark early and cold but I can bundle up with nice movies or video games and just escape it really easily.

So recently I’ve gotten a job as a Customer Service Fundraiser a fancy word for canvasser and It is a predatory middle man. We go door to door and ask for donations for  the charity’s if you live in a house you probably have had this happen to you. Don’t get me wrong this isn’t a scam more or less but we make commissions on how many monthly donors we can acquire. You need 1 everyday to keep your job and minimum wage and if you get 2 a day u can earn about 20-22$. If you get 12 Monthly donors in 10 Days you can be a team leader and make more money. Why this is a predatory middleman service? We basically knock on doors and persuade you to sign up for a monthly donation we are taught to use emotions and feelings to hook you and will get you invested before we tell you that it is a monthly payment. Don’t get me wrong these charity’s are good causes but you can donate directly to their websites so they receive all of your money. If you do decide to donate monthly through a canvasser the company usually receives half of your donation.
(We have multiple offices and branches so we are profitable) We also have cash incentives to get you to become a monthly donations (thousands of dollars spread out with each top seller) We have 10 days to get 5 donors or we get fired.
So I will be telling you about the charity i’m working and to donate thru the websites until i get fired :)
if you have a job opening thats not as scummy as this that I can interview for let me know.

PLEASE DO NOT BE RUDE TO CANVASSERS
UPPER MANAGEMENT ARE THE LEECHS THEY ARE SELLING YOU A CHARITY( A GOOD CAUSE) AND MAKING MONEY FROM IT THEY MAKE 30+ A HOUR 



most canvassers are immigrants or students who believe in what they are doing raising money for charity’s
If we don’t meet our quota we get fired
this is a job like everything else some are amazing people. 

Tips to send canvassers away.

Put a No Soliciting sign up we will usually not knock

Tell us you are already contributing we will usually thank you 

A simply no I’m not interested saves a lot of time.


If we stop donating to canvassers and donate directly to charities more of our money will be going to a good cause then to someone who is selling u the idea of helping when they are taking most of your money.

We aren’t actually doing your tax forms or anything like that we are just signing you up thru our end so we have proof we signed you up to donate. 

Charity’s that we work with they are good cause and you should donate if you are able to afford it.(Please donate through the website and not thru canvassers)

Looking for advice or tips on current tutoring scene. Current UBC student. Took a break from the tutoring scene during the Pandemic when I was in HS. Looking to get back into it. Any advice on what I should do or who to talk to? Craigslist and Facebook not too helpful atm.

Hey Vancouver,

Hope you're all doing well after all that snow; at least the sun's coming out now. Just wanted to fire this quick post out to ask you all for any advice on what the tutoring scene looks like right now.

For some context, I'm a current UBC Student living in Metro Vancouver, and I was looking to offer my services as a tutor, primarily in Metro Vancouver. I have had 1 year of experience tutoring Math and SAT prep, but I wanted to see if I could start tutoring with people around Vancouver. I just feel it'll be a more fulfilling experience to give back to the community where I have my roots. I'm comfortable teaching almost anything up to High School - anything after that might be a little bit of a stretch (my specialization is Science). I've been looking around on Facebook and Craigslist, but it seems that I haven't received any replies for the past few weeks, nor does it seem like there are any postings that fit my niche. Those who do put out posts are really lowballing it; around $15 an hour or are way out in Maple ridge or Surrey.

Just wanted to get some information from the community on where I should look or who I should talk to; you can probably see I'm still pretty green (went to Uni right after graduation HS). This is NOT AN AD, I haven't really put any of my achievements or anything here, just wanted to learn more about what I can do.

And this mfker is watering his lawn in the early early mornings to avoid getting caught. 

Everyone is doing their part and not watering their lawns so we can have that water for drinking or other essential purposes.

Everyone's lawns are yellow and this guy's is bright green.

Where can I report him anonymously?

Edit: it seems that people are accusing me of wanting to report him after seeing him water a single time. That or they themselves sneakily water their lawns during the wrong days and don't want people reporting them.

The reason I'm reporting him is because:

He waters almost every day. He's an even numbered address so he should only be allowed to water on Saturdays. 

He waters past 7am every day with sprinklers, you're supposed to stop before 7am and only on the allotted days.

And he hasn't just redone his lawn nor has he applied for a water exemption because he is supposed to display the paid permit in the front and he has not.

He is heavily breaking the water restriction laws and we're in the middle of a fking drought. That's why.

I also love everyone's trying to come up with excuses for the watering and the moment I confirm that the neighbor is watering too much and not on the allotted time, everyone just shuts up or resorts to name calling. 

It's clear to me that people are unhappy with me because they probably also water outside the current water restriction rules and don't care about how there's a fking drought going on as long as their lawn looks pretty and green. 

Funny how every time someone breaks rules, this subreddit screams for punishment and turns into discount judge Dredd.

And yet when homeowners are the ones breaking the rules, everyone suddenly acts like it's the fking LA gang streets ""no snitching, snitches get stitches, no one tell on anyone for over-watering.

So I was very surprised to learn that it *did* happen here:

> In 1910, Vancouver became the first large city to cease collecting any taxes on buildings and movable property. Municipal revenue was instead based exclusively on the value of land. ... By 1914, approximately two-thirds of cities in British Columbia, all of Alberta, and one-fourth in Saskatchewan taxed land alone. Most of the remainder of the region taxed land at a higher rate than improvements. [#](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ajes.12218)

Why the enthusiasm for LVT in the early 1900s? There were many reasons but the main one was that cities were competing for new residents:

> Land value taxation spread like wildfire throughout Western Canada as a consensus emerged that it spurred development. In this rapidly developing region, where municipalities were competing for population and investment, the pressure to adopt a more efficient basis of taxation was irresistible. [#](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ajes.12218)

LVT didn't last long as the only tax. Enthusiasm for LVT waned after the world entered a recession and Vancouver's first property bubble burst. In 1918 Vancouver switched to a hybrid of LVT and something similar to today's property tax. 

Over the next several decades, homeowners became an increasingly powerful voting bloc. Tax policy was incrementally changed to be more favourable for them. The changes would:

> ""reduce the relative tax load on vacant land and single-family dwelling groups but would increase the tax load on apartments, industrial and commercial groups” (VCC Minutes 1969). [#](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ajes.12218)

In 1984 LVT was fully eliminated.

EDIT: just realized I posted the title going backwards whoops!

Given the heavy smoke expected in the next few days and having nothing to do on a Friday night, I decided to loop the Central Valley Greenway (CVG) and BC Parkway (BCP) tonight from Commercial and Broadway to New Westminster. Earlier this week someone was discussing the awkward Rupert Station transition (it's gotten worse!) but there's other screwy spots that make this an intermediate/advanced ride, which is a shame because this could otherwise be a really fun day trip/outing. The following is a pretty comprehensive review

BCP Eastbound Vancouver - 8/10 Overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride in Vancouver proper. Heading through Trout Lake on the dedicated bike path is pretty easy and people generally stick to the gravel pedestrian path. There's a short but steep climb between 19th and Stainsbury to reconnect with the skytrain line at Nanaimo. The bike path at Nanaimo has been really improved recently, with clear separated lanes to a dedicated incline at Nanaimo Station up to Slocan st. There's an awkward transition at Slocan to 29th ave that requires a bit of road use, but then the dedicated path behind 29th is pretty well developed and spills on to Vaness, which is not a busy road when it needs to be taken. Passing Joyce station I find it much simpler to take Venables St to Boundary than the separated bike path because of heavy pedestrian use, and relatively light vehicle traffic with intersections only on the south side.

BCP Burnaby - 6/10 Similar heavy pedestrian use on the path in Central Park path with no real work around. The Metrotown area again has heavy shared pedestrian use on the bike path, and I found it was better to ride Beresford alongside very light traffic. Crossing the road at Willingdon requires a lot of caution. The transition at Central Blvd and Imperial has been improved from a very thin awkward sidewalk riding against traffic, it's been widened with a vehicle fence which feels so much safer. Once you get back on the parkway the ride gets pretty choppy with many busy and undeveloped vehicles crossings that require a lot of caution until you return to Beresford. I also found the road to be better than the bike path, although I've taken both without issue. The traffic is very light and there's no absent minded pedestrians. Crossing to Prenter St the path gets very narrow, with construction entirely blocking a transition on to the bike path. Edmonds Station gets very nice again with a short dip through a park and a dedicated path behind the skytrain maintenance yard.. The path is winding with a steep decline, so it's definitely best to have the brakes ready! Overall this stretch is a real joy until 22nd Station in New Westminster.

BCP New Westminster - 4/10

What. The. Fuck. As soon as you get across 22nd station you're riding a thin sidewalk along Stewardson, which is the BCP in both directions and the only pedestrian sidewalk. Thankfully I was the only using it at the time. Lots of intersections to be cautious of right turning drivers along. This is NOT a safe path to ride, use a lot of caution. Once you get to Quayside things open up a bit again with shared road and light vehicle traffic. There's one section of diagonal train tracks to watch out for along this stretch lest you catch a wheel! Crossing the train tracks to Columbia St leads to a nice separated bike path downtown, the transition to the CVG at the Patullo.

CVG New West (Westbound) - 4/10

Things are really nice until you pass the Patullo. Then you're stuck on a thin stretch of sidewalk with only plastic pylon barriers, riding against traffic until Mcbride st. This section is very unsafe to navigate without a lot of caution, nerve wracking, it's a busy road and there's nothing but a few plastic bumpers between you and the oncoming traffic. Things get nice and riding through the park at Victoria Hill, only to end up back against traffic, crossing driveways and intersections on the sidewalk at E Columbia.... Not ideal but not scary like the previous, and next part. As soon as you cross Cumberland St there's about two blocks of incredibly narrow shared use sidewalk, with pedestrians and two way bike traffic for about 200m. Like this would be nerve wracking to walk along if it was busy, much less ride. I would even have trouble dismounting safely here, so thankfully there was no pedestrians. Then there's a massive hill to climb on E Columbia heading to Royal Columbian, followed by a downhill to catch your breath at Kelly St. Following Kelly to Hume Park the CVG gets a dedicated lane again, which is a nice descent that wraps around the park to the bottom of E Columbia/North Road. A clear crossing, a slight separated path, then you're back on the sidewalk against traffic on North Road. With no signage to tell you to follow a dim path east off North Road on a gravel path, I lost the connection and ended up taking Lougheed Highway to Vancouver.

CVG Burnaby - 8/10

Again I missed the connection and ended up going against traffic on North Road until getting to a bunch of parking lots, where I took a break and walked it through. However I've ridden the Burnaby portion of the CVG before and can say that this is a much nicer bike path with dedicated trails through Burnaby Lake and shared lane with light traffic along Winston and Still Creek. the only issues that really presents itself with crossings is an awkward intersection at Douglas Rd and Still Creek. There's no simple way to navigate this intersection so use caution. I'm also not a huge fan of separated lanes running along sidewalks that cross parking lots, so tend to just use Still Creek when traffic is light. The little path connecting Gilmore is really cool, but it tends to flood in the spring/fall. A little path behind the home depot to Boundary, and a large crossing with a pedestrian light connect to Vancouver. Honestly pretty good!

CVG Vancouver - 8/10

Honestly this path is generally well thought out and straightforward with very few inclines. It's one of the ideal bike paths I've seen in this city with minimal light shared road use EXCEPT for Rupert Station. You may as well just walk it right now anyways, since the East side of the street next to the station is barricaded to dismount anyways. A steady incline to Nanaimo st (felt brutal by this point haha) and then a mix of dedicated and traffic controlled lanes to E 10th ave. Technically the path crosses Broadway here and continues left on 8th, but for transit connection go left. There's an awkward hard left turn and a mixed use pedestrian crossing, but the short stretch of 10th between Victoria and Commercial has again been greatly improved.",,,vancouver,Cycling review (long): Central Valley to BC Parkway Loop,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/15v8sue/cycling_review_long_central_valley_to_bc_parkway/

Some backstory: I rent an apartment in a house built in the 80s in Vancouver.  At some point; around 20 years ago, the house was gutted and turned into 4 separate residential units. Apartments, if you will. 

Ever since the day I moved in, the neighbours upstairs have been giving me trouble. Literally, my first night spent in this place I woke up to banging on my door from the guy upstairs telling me that my stereo system was humming all night in the living room. I do *not* have a stereo system, and at the time I literally had almost no possessions. I showed him my empty living room, told him I don’t have a stereo system, and he left disgruntled. 

Ever since then it’s been a bombardment of complaints from him. In the 1.5 years I’ve lived here he has come down 100+ times. He complains about the slightest noises, he’s interrogated my friends and guests, asking them who’s living in my apartment. He’s accused me of using his trash cans, and a bunch of other crap that I have never done. Sometimes his wife will send me a kindly worded text about something, but when he comes down and bangs on my door he totally blows his top. 

The last time he came down, a few days ago, he accused me of smoking pot inside (which is something I don’t do). Other tenants in the building smoke weed, and the ventilation is all connected, but he insists that it’s me. I told him to fuck off or I’ll call the cops and he called the landlord, who basically just called me and apathetically reiterated the buildings no smoking policy. 

In the past few days he’s been wearing shoes inside and stomping on the floor like crazy, and letting his kid go crazy with playing/screaming/etc. Its really petty. I know I’m a good tenant and neighbour because I’ve never had any issues like this in my life before, and I’ve rented lots, shared rooms, you name it. I’m not sure how to deal with this guy.

I was feeling pretty low at my work today with all the overlapping urgent projects and deadlines, so I just starred out my window blankly (I know, nice to have a window). 

I then noticed a very old gentleman walking across Smithe street with a seeing eye cane (more commonly known as a “probing cane” or “white cane”) very slowly, and I thought to myself “man, he better get a move on before the light changes.” And he didn’t get a move on, but he made it across without getting smoked by a blind bmw. 

He then needed to traverse Hornby street when a large young punk approached him (not really a punk, but had large headphones on and I feel like “punk” enhances the story) approached the gentleman and bent down – and I thought to myself “that old dude is going to lose his seeing eye cane now.”

BUT, the large young man must have said something nice – BECAUSE they held hands and walked across Hornby Street! They held hands, and the young man helped that old dude across the street. Then, the young guy just said “bye” and hustled up the other way! And didn’t push anyone or take anything.

I still can’t believe it. And it really made me feel good about everything.

 * Message me with the business name, website, and small blurb (see below for examples)
 * Represent the business in some fashion (Owner or Employee - The original idea is we help promote /r/Vancouver businesses during the holidays)

If you don’t represent the business but want to give them a shout out, feel free to do so in the comments!

I'll add categories as the list progresses, but I want to explain/talk about the following:

 * *Store of the Week* - This is a store that was nominated from /r/Vancouverites or where I've shopped because they were on the list. Normally it's a small write up.
 * *Flash Deals* - This is a section for stores doing special deals for a limited time like Black Friday or Boxing Day.
 * *Friends of /r/Vancouver* - This is a section for stores that give /r/Vancouver a small discount. Categorized by discount and then by alphabet.

**STORE OF THE WEEK - [Small Noggin Studios](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Smallnogginstudios)**

I’ve learned small, cute stationery are great ways to cap off a gift to a friend, co-worker, or even some family members. It’s like a *bonus* surprise to them, and chances are you can find one that is personal to you and the individual. A great example with Small Noggin Studios that I’ve used is Awkward Monkey with a few co-workers as an inside joke.

One other thing I love is their reversible magnets. They have one for dishwashers and feeding pets.  

Small Noggin Studio is filled with cute stickers and magnets, it’ll be difficult not to find one that is funny to you.

He then called me yesterday morning saying he was kicked out of his moms and in bad shape (he is an adult, lives in Fraser Health region) so I picked him up and brought him to my place to talk.

^^^^^

I then realized the extent of the situation as he pulled a roll of tinfoil out of his bag and started smoking what I assume is some sort of super-heroin (worse than fentanyl because somehow he still passed a urine test for his father this morning after I had him picked up from my house).

^^^^^

The way he was acting on it makes me think it was one of the new variants that contains Benzodiazepine analogs that are not yet identified here so tests won't show them, but I have never seen anyone more incapacitated in my life and I was unable to have a real conversation with him the entire time he was here. He fell down multiple times, had scrapes and bruises already when I picked him up, and was in and out of states of what seemed to be psychosis saying things that made no sense and even walking back in to the house thinking he was at his dad's house at one point.

^^^^^

I was just in awe because this is someone i've watched battling addiction for many years, he's overdosed multiple times, but finally was stable and building his life again until this week I guess. I sat there with Narcan the whole time as he came in and out of consciousness with no sense of reality. I texted his dad and told him what was going on and he came and picked him up to take him straight to Royal Columbia in the hopes they would do a 72hr psych hold or whatever the standard protocol is, but somehow, they let him refuse treatment and walk away despite the fact that he looked like he was about to die. His dad told me he just asked ""Am I being detained?"" Repeatedly and they let him walk away.

^^^^^

He is currently sleeping at his dads house and I know as soon as he wakes up he will head out to find more of that shit. He said multiple things about self-harm last night, but problem is that he often would sarcastically say that for as long as i've known him so it would be disingenuous for me to say that he meant it this time, so IDK what to do.

^^^^^

 I am the only one he trusts, he's having paranoid delusions with everyone else, so if he knows that I called in and got him picked up I would potentially lose all contact with him and maybe never see him again. At the same time, he's so gone right now that I have no hope of any sort of personal intervention, HEAVY duty medical intervention is likely the only way he lives in this scenario. I don't know what to do, his parents don't know what to do (they are divorced and don't speak but i've been in touch with both of them exchanging info and filling them in on the reality of the situation).

V_imaginary,,,,1663725450,,,xjrjgu,,,,,,t3_xjrjgu,146,,/r/vancouver/comments/xjrjgu/saved_a_life_today_reality_vs_theorynews/,,,,"I (F28) am an HCP (health care professional) and during my workday was called to bring a naloxone kit to the front of the building because they suspect someone was overdosing. My coworker D (F) came with me as support. 

When we arrived on scene there were a couple men surrounding a man who was collapsed on the sidewalk, blue in the face, not breathing. I’ve never seen someone like that before. One person was giving (poor) CPR. 
Nobody called 9-1-1 yet so D got on the phone right away while I get started on the naloxone. I point at an onlooker staff and yell to get an AED. (I should mention as per my job requirements, I have to have emergency first aid and CPR-C, and thankfully I just renewed at the end of august) everyone around me looked clueless. They had no idea what an AED was.

When the first dose gets into this guy’s system, he gasps for air, and I can actually see his face become more pink. But the effects are short-lived and I continue giving naloxone until I’ve run out of doses. I continue to yell for an AED (surprisingly at my job there isn’t one) until someone understands). Somewhere in between my manager S (F) comes out and she takes over CPR. This guy would breathe for a little, and then slip back into unconsciousness. I finally got an AED at the same time the paramedics arrived. They took over and so we left the scene to give them space to work. 
Later we find out he declined the ride to hospital, is up and talking and having a smoke. 
The paramedics said if we had not been there, he would not have lived. He said thank you to D when she saw him later. 

I’m generally very calm and logical during emergencies as I’ve been through a lot now (even though it shouldn’t be common my my profession). But I’ve never actually had to use naloxone, or use/see actual CPR, or see someone dead/dying/brink of death, or need to control the scene. I’ve learned that again theory is very different than reality. 

1. Naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose but definitely does not last as long as we were taught
2. CPR looks way different on an actual person

4. Someone who looks like they’re dying is more obvious than I thought (vs sleeping) 

Anyway, I just wanted to share what I learned today, and maybe discuss any tips or advice for future emergencies or any “firsts” that wasn’t what you expected. 

TL;DR Me and my coworkers brought a man back to life from the brink of death from opioid overdose and this was my first big emergency scenario and it was way different than what I learned

ETA: thank you for the awards! Thank you for letting me know about potential PTSD. I will be more aware and mindful of my mental state and speak to a professional if needed. I really appreciate all the kind words and advice/tips as well!

Looking to get other peoples thoughts, suggestions, and resources on the question!  This is flaired ""discussion"" for a reason!

I believe we are headed for some very rough years ahead - for discussions sake lets say up to the next 50 years (as I'm currently in my 30s).  I have a background in geography, the public sector and asset management which has had me thinking about this question more and more lately.  I would be interested to hear thoughts in 2 general categories - purely most resilient (ie. the title of this post); but also what is the most climate resilient place in BC that ALSO balances against quality of life, access to amenities, cost of living, jobs, etc. etc.

I've been browsing [https://climatereadybc.gov.bc.ca/](https://climatereadybc.gov.bc.ca/) and [https://www.pacificclimate.org/analysis-tools/plan2adapt](https://www.pacificclimate.org/analysis-tools/plan2adapt) as a starting point and I'm sure there are ministries and other professionals with the government or private sector looking at the problem considering all aspects (am I sure? I sure hope they are looking at all this...)  I guess my question stems a bit from a doubt whether the government is doing enough, quickly enough.

However, as someone deeply involved in safety on the job, it's disheartening to witness the ongoing compromises. Safety often takes a back seat, and it's only when an unfortunate incident occurs that people start paying attention. This negligence is driven by concerns about expenses, inconvenience, annoyance, and time constraints.

Even organizations like WorkSafe sometimes seem focused on saving money or time, leading to ambiguous laws. Our occupational health and safety standards in British Columbia are notably higher than those in other provinces, yet there's a push to lower them to a ""universal"" standard across the country for the sake of time and cost savings. The title ""Construction Safety Officer"" is primarily associated with Vancouver building codes, but what most of us do is act as ""Qualified Coordinators."" It's crucial for all of us to have at least a minimum OFA 2 certification to cover these sites. Sometimes, the responsibilities can be overwhelming for a single CSO due to the vagueness and subjectivity of the regulations.

It's frustrating that every site I oversee seems to have its peculiar issues. Phrases like ""look the other way,"" ""scrub the records,"" and ""WorkSafe hasn't visited this site in over 2 years; let's keep it that way"" are all too common. But when a colleague decides to adhere strictly to the rules, WorkSafe suddenly decides to inspect all those sites within the company. They might find a couple of machines out of compliance, label it a day for inspections, throw that colleague under the bus, fire them, and bring in someone like me who won't report the company.

Just the other day, a Mexican worker suffered a severe injury—a snapped-back hammer to the face—resulting in a RTC scenario. Shockingly, there was another worker injured at the same time, but it was treated as a Triage Scenario- had to let that one go and deal with the mexican- who turned out to be an undocumented worker- had to fly back to Mexico that night for facial surgery. Scrub the records of him even existing on the site. In such situations, you learn that sometimes safety takes a back seat and many laws are being broken every day.

And when it comes to industrial jobs, it's sometimes a joke. Working in confined spaces without proper safety measures can make you feel like your life is at the mercy of the task at hand. For instance, consider the risks involved in projects like the Broadway subway construction. In case of an earthquake, it's a precarious situation.

Entering the trades is a commendable choice, but it's essential to be aware of the risks you're assuming on every site, every day. If you're indispensable to the project, safety violations may go unnoticed because the site super needs you to keep the operation running smoothly. We, safety professionals, are essentially insurance policies hired to minimize risks, but  oftentimes safety takes a backseat.

If nobody else seems to care, it's essential to remember that you bear the responsibility when you work these jobs. Also, it's worth noting that in some situations, it may be cheaper for everyone to deal with your ""loss of life on the job"" over a carrier ending injury.

Consider this a warning: Our country is facing similar issues to America in terms of workplace safety. We used to set the bar high with the best safety gear and the highest standards, but that seems to be a thing of the past.

Lastly, a word of caution: Avoid riding the Broadway subway once it's operational. You've been warned.",,,britishcolumbia,Growing Disillusioned with my job- oh yeah hey I'm a CSO BTW.,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/169eai1/growing_disillusioned_with_my_job_oh_yeah_hey_im/

Ontarian here whose experience with natural disasters is entirely tornadoes: For a handful of evenings every summer, we have to mosey down to the basement while the wind dances and possibly throws a barn for fun. Flooding too - Southern ON is too wet to burn, but everyone has a sump pump to work the water back out of their basement when the rains come. All that to say, I've never had to deal with a natural emergency that could last for several days and required me to pack an emergency bag and have the pets ready to go at the drop of a hat. You can also recover a lot more stuff from a house that is flattened by wind than from one that is burned to cinders.

So watching BC's and NWT's wildfires scare the shit out of me: Those are big cities getting chewed through by fires labelled as ""out of control"".

All that said, BC is beautiful and my spouse is keen to move (back) to the province after a long foray in the east. I want to try and at least seriously consider the possibility of moving to BC and understand our options. I know there's no guarantee of avoiding a fire 100%, but it seems like some regions (hello everywhere along that highway to Alaska) are put on alert more frequently than others.

What are my options if we move to BC and want to have the lowest possible wildfire risk in the future - Van Island? - and are there other extreme weather considerations I need to have in mind when looking at those areas? Links to any recent regional averages for fires are also super appreciated.

I was quite emotional when writing this and part of me wants to delete it but for now I will leave it up. Thank you for all the supportive comments its appreciated. 


I am on the front lines in scotch creek and celista. I'm working with the fire departments and citizens to keep them fed and safe. The first day we had HUNDREDS of people coming and going asking what they can do to help. Every single one was defying the evacuation order to save their town. A noble and honourable act indeed. The fire chief meticulously took each ones names and numbers and relevant skills. They were told the best place to go to put out spot fires. They brought food and supplies to the firehall and were in turn fed and watered. They were an integral part of saving the town. I watched this unfold with my own eyes. 

So many people acting courageously when the time came. Hundreds of people willing to risk their lives to protect their town, yet the volunteer fire departments total manpower is less than 20. It makes my blood absolutely boil. If even half of those 100 people had stepped up and received training they could have been infinitely more useful in slowing the fires. The #1 problem they had was manpower. They had hundreds of people available willing to fight but all that manpower is useless without the communication and organization that is needed to actually properly fight the fires.
 
I have the utmost respect for each one of those citizens and I beg beg beg ANYONE who feels that they have the strength and courage to defy an evacuation order to protect their town to join the fucking agencies that are dedicated to do that exact thing. If they had 100 volunteer firefighters with 100 radios they could justify the expense of 100 sets of gear, more trucks, more equipment. Instead we had locals fighting fires in the middle of the bush when houses were burning. We had air assets available to deploy but they COULDNT because locals were in the middle of the forest fighting fires. 

I'm not even going into the thefts because desperate people saving their homes do desperate things. Its despicable, but I can at least emphasize with  it. What absolutely enraged me was finding a group of locals 10km from town fighting a fire using obviously stolen equipment in an area where no structures were at risk.  They were there because if they were closer to town they would have been caught with stolen gear. They got to play fireman deep in the Bush believing they were helping the community all the while preventing air assets from being used, using equipment that could have been used to protect structures.

THIS is the truth that needs to be shared. The RCMP overstepped their grounds but they did so because the theft is so rampant. Thieves stole the fucking  pumps from the scotch creek bridge for gods sakes.

I implore ANYONE who has the courage to defy an evacuation order, JOIN YOUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. They will give you training! Provide you with the organization to effectively deploy large amounts of manpower. You will get to stay and protect your community through evacuation orders. You will be allowed to move freely through town. ITS SO EASY. Its SO much easier than the alternative...hiding and skirting law enforcement without coordination and communication. 

Fuck

So much devastation, so much loss. So much manpower waisted I just cant take it. 5 days of 18 hour days working with people who lost their homes yet they still show up every day and will continue despite their fellow community members efforts to undermine their work.

Hopefully you all are as fine as possible.

We are a couple from Austria which travels to Canada next week. Our first idea was to stay at my gf brother's place in Calgary and visit Banff,  jasper and drumheller. Usually we do like hiking, nature, food and wine on our vacation.

Afterwards our plan was to drive from Calgary to Vancouver (31.8. to 7.9) stay in Vancouver for two days and then head home to Austria on 9.9. Stops were few areas in the Kootenay region and Okanagan valley.  We already have a car rental booked.

However, since the recent wildfires in Kelowna we do not want to stay there anymore due to not block any homes for people who need to be evacuated. Not sure if it even would be possible for us to stay there on 4th of September die to the travel ban for tourists in that area.

Therefore we think about to rearrange our whole trip between Calgary and Vancouver. We have some options but do not know if they make any sense.

Option 1: Still visit Kootenays and maybe Watertown lakes National Park and then head to Vancouver. Some risks would include: road blocks due to fires, and smoke in the Kootenays since there also are wildfires. Does anyone know how the situation is there? We'd like to visit Cranbrook, nelson, Ainsworth Kasko and nakusp.

Option 2: cancel the car rental and fly to Vancouver directly. Than book a car rental in Vancouver and visit Vancouver island instead for the remaining time. However, Vancouver Island seems much more expensive than Kootenays.

Option 3: not sure exactly. Maybe drive via hwy1 and stop somewhere in between. Like golden revelstoke and do the sea to sky highway. 

Since this all is quite spontaneous we are a bit overwhelmed with the options and would like to rebook everything by tomorrow if possible. Hopefully some of you has some insights and tips for us.

Thank you in advance and stay strong!

Edit: first of all we are overwhelmed by the number of replies. Unfortunately I am not able to answer all of you, but I wanted to say, that we are going by option B. It is more expensive, but it is the safer bet.

Consider building a Corsi-Rosenthal box with a $50 box fan and one or more MERV13 (3M Filtrete 1900) furnace filters. Richard Corsi is the Dean of Engineering of UC Davis, and Jim Rosenthal is a Texan engineer who runs a furnace filter company. I have built many as part of teams that assembled them for schools for COVID. They are ideal for forest fire smoke. The numbers check out in terms of extreme simplicity of build, CADR (volumes of air purified per unit time), and particulate counts. These things pound through the air, and if you have a particle counter (PM2.5, PM10), you will see the numbers drop fast in real time. What a relief.

You need: One standard box fan, 1-5 MERV13 filters (20"" x 20""), duct tape. 

For a one-filter unit (called the ""Elfstrom variation), follow these detailed instructions on Twitter from the HVAC/P.Eng., David Elfrom, in Ontario. 246 cfm, Energy star rating, costs $55:

Actually going to Ontario till Christmas this year, I thought it was going to be simple but with wildfires everywhere I'm not so sure anymore.  DriveBC shows going through Kamloops then to Calgary should be fine, however I know by shushwaps area there's evacuations.  Is it a better bet to add few extra hours and just use Crowsnest pass?  I know Osoyoos was on fire a while back too but driveBC map looks clear.  How much can I trust this DriveBC?

I just got evacuated from work in Yellowknife midweek, would really hate to get myself into another situation like that.  However I must go, can't avoid it as I no longer have anywhere to stay in BC and hotels here would bankrupt me.

During a press conference on Saturday, Aug. 19, Premier David Eby and Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma announced the measures, which come a day after a provincial state of emergency was declared.

The order restricting travel for non-essential reasons applies to Kamloops, Vernon, Kelowna, Penticton, Osoyoos and Oliver.

“Let me be clear, temporary **accommodations** in the areas I mentioned are no longer available for non-essential visits,” Ma said, noting **hotel and motel rooms are now available only for evacuees and firefighters and other first responders.**

## Emergency BC Info

[Provincial State of Emergency & Travel Restrictions. August 19, 2023](https://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/provincial-state-of-emergency-august-18-2023/)

* Effective 1 PM today, the province has issued an order that restricts travel to temporary accommodation in or at wildfire-affected communities in the southern interior of the province.
* The order is designed to discourage and stop recreational and leisure travel for tourist accommodation. The order does not restrict essential travel through or to these communities – including for work, for school and to help care for a sick loved one.
* There will be no random stops or street checks enforcing this order. We’re not interested in disrupting commuters and people going about their lives. What we want to do is ensure those needing accommodation in wildfire-affected areas have access to it.
* We continue to strongly urge people to avoid travel within these regions as well. If you live in Victoria or the Lower Mainland, do not vacation in the Southern Interior right now. If you live in Chilliwack, do not spend a weekend in Osoyoos.
* This order affects a small portion of the province. There are many places to vacation in B.C.
* For more information visit [EmergencyInfoBC](http://www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca/)

Edit 1: Guideline also applies to videos

Hi everyone.

With the different and recent Wildfires that have sprouted up in the past few days, there have been an understandable amount of pictures that have been posted to show the absolute scale and destruction that they have brought to our respective communities. On behalf of the [r/britishcolumbia](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia) mod team, we'd like to express our thoughts and well wishes to those most affected, and especially want everyone to get themselves to safety.

As these fires have grown fast and rapidly, we also understand that there are folks who haven't been able to post their photos right away. For example, there are reports that people have had to sleep in their cars overnight, on their way top safety. We'd like to help ensure that people aren't seeing new posts and thinking there's a new fire to worry about.

&#x200B;

**Moving forward, please ensure that your posts START** **with**

\[*Specific* Location - Date/Time\]

e.g.

\[Hwy 1 north of Boston Bar - Aug 18/2:30PM\]

\[Gyro Beach Park West Kelowna - Aug 17/9:30AM\]

Being as specific as possible will help all of us better understand the rapidly evolving situations.

West Kelowna one is looking pretty aggressive they just expanded the evacuation order. We’re packing a to go bag just in case! For those of you who haven’t been here for BC fire season or are unaware about emergency preparedness PLEASE HAVE A GO BAG READY🚨 Fires move very quickly and the wind here currently is ideal for the fire to jump. Overnight we will need to keep alert! It can happen very quickly so be prepared. 🚨

What I pack in mine is any paperwork, contracts, things that I cannot replace like that or documents. ID (passports, birth certificates etc). Medications & note the prescriptions 💊Contacts, glasses 👓 Laptops, any tech you may have that you wouldn’t want to lose! Toothbrush toothpaste 🪥 Extra chargers, portable chargers if you have them. Also make sure your pets are indoors and you have their vet information etc just in case! 

In addition to that I recommend keeping notes in a cloud/online based notepad like Evernote etc with prescriptions, important info, and TAKE PHOTOS OF ANYTHING YOU DONT BRING or videos of your house belongings for insurance purposes. Make sure this stuff is accessible and ready to go quickly in case you do not have time to search. Any sentimental things you can’t lose as well. 

With the fires in the Northwest Territories etc burning in remote areas I think it’s also important to note that you should get to know those in your neighbourhoods and communities. The government is not helping us! They will not be the ones at the ready in your time of need if it comes and now more than ever we need to focus on community! Some people do not drive, some are disabled, some elderly and we all need to look out for one another 💗

My question is; if I have to evacuate in the meantime, will I be able to get it to my family's house without being severely fined?

It used to be weekly now it’s near daily. There is a grate with what appears to be a ventilation fan that is on only sometimes, but the landlord/building owner keeps it off. I think he started to turn it on now when he comes to the building because we sent a complaint. When it’s on, the hallway doesn’t smell so bad. When it’s off, the second hand smoke is overwhelming not just when you’re in the hallway (to the point that when I’ve leaving I’m holding my breath or I’ll gag/cough) but it completely floods our entire unit. We have to open the sliding door to air out the place which means we can’t use our new a/c, kinda defeating the purpose of getting it… 

I wrote another request today asking him to keep the ventilation on continuously as it’s negatively impacting our air quality in our unit due to second hand smoke but just had the realization that it might be against code/a safety issue to not have hallway ventilation going continuously. I realized what if there was a fire or a gas leak in another unit (we have gas fireplaces) or some other kind of noxious chemical in the air and the hallway had no ventilation as we tried to evacuate? Is this a safety issue? If it’s not kept on continuously can I express a safety concern?

I did try searching online for information and I saw some stuff about ventilation requirements but nothing that clearly outlines what I’m asking about. The building is old as shit but it clearly as ventilation as it’s on sporadically.

For example: chainsaws can cause sparks when they strike rock, and that’s easy to do when bucking logs for winter firewood.",,,britishcolumbia,"Beyond cigarettes and camp fires, what are other forest fire risks people should be aware of?",0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/14tht3x/beyond_cigarettes_and_camp_fires_what_are_other/

At the time, type 1 fires were permitted in this area, and there were no specific signs banning campers from having campfires in this specific campsite. I had a chat with the group, asking if this was the best idea; there was not a proper fire ring, the local fire risk was “high” and that alpine wood typically takes a long time to grow and it is not the most sustainable choice, plus if the fire did get out of hand, give the remoteness it would be hard to put the fire out. Their defence was that they looked at the fire regulation and this type of fire was permitted, according to this logic they were correct (they were very nice about it).

My question is, are there any specific rules that prevent people from having campfires in the alpine? If there isn't, should there be? It’s such a fragile ecosystem and it leads to campers tearing up the little alpine trees and shrubs for fire wood.

Since last weekend, I note that a ban on campfires is due to be enacted, but for the future it would be good to know this.

How did the Cariboo Gold Rush change the History of Canada? Why should Barkerville be your next travel destination?*

1. First of all, [**Barkerville**](https://terraencounters.wordpress.com/2023/06/13/barkerville-bc-the-town-that-changed-the-history-of-canada/) is not a ghost town — it was still in use until 1958. Filled with original wood buildings, it lets you travel back in time to the 19th century when there were only dirt roads and raised wood boardwalks.
2. Second, the town was built almost overnight twice — The first time at the beginning of the Cariboo Gold Rush. The second time it was rebuilt in six weeks after a devastating fire in 1868.
3. Third, it is the largest preserved historic site in Western North America.
4. Fourth, Barkerville was the first Chinese community in Canada and half of the residents were Chinese!

Today, [**Barkerville**](http://barkerville/) is populated with costumed interpreters and shopkeepers who have assumed the identities of past colourful characters. The skits are entertaining and sometimes very funny.

5. Finally, it played a significant role in Canadian history that affected all of North America.

I am dismayed by how many people - including Ministry of Labour employees - don't know some of this basic information. For example, the ""Labour"" Board is for the ""Labour"" industry... that is... unions.

**For issues with the Employee / Employer Relationship:**

* **Union workers:** **contact your union for all issues.** If you have a problem with the union itself or if you are trying to START a union, contact the Labour Board. Remember... Labour Board = Union.
* **If you are a worker that is not covered under a collective agreement (union), not in a federally-regulated industry, and not in an excluded profession or occupation:** if you have an issue with your employer, contact the **Employment Standards Branch** unless it is related to an occupational health and safety issue.
* **Workers in** [**Federally Regulated Industries**](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/workplace/federally-regulated-industries.html): you may not fall under the jurisdiction of the Employment Standards Act OR all provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, so start with your union, if you have one. I would love someone to fill in my information gap on how to help workers that belong to federally regulated industries.
* **Workers in excluded** [**Professions & Occupations**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/forms-resources/igm/esr-part-7-section-31) are covered by a variety of other legislation. The Employment Standards Act doesn't apply to workers in these categories, so don't call the Employment Standards Branch for help. You probably need to contact your professional body.
* **Gig workers:** try the Employment Standards Branch, but you may be SOL. This is apparently on the Ministry of Labour's ""to do"" list. Most gig workers are considered Independent Contractors, so they are not protected by any labour-related legislation. If this is important to you, contact your MLA or Minister Harry Bains' office to let them know how you feel.

**For Occupational Health and Safety Issues**, including bullying & harassment or Prohibited Actions (when your union or employer punishes you for raising an health & safety issue):

* **Union workers: contact your union.**
* **Most workers in BC, including federally-regulated industry workers and union workers: Contact WorkSafeBC.** You should always go through internal channels first, though.
* The OHS provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act **do not apply to mines governed under the Mines Act**, so if you work in this environment, WorkSafeBC may not be the right people to go to, so if you don't have a union, you should contact... ???

**For help dealing with WorkSafeBC:**

* If you have a complaint about the **service quality or communication problems at WorkSafeBC: contact the** [Fair Practices Office](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/contact-us/departments-and-services/fair-practices-office) **of WorkSafeBC OR the** [Provincial Ombudsperson](https://bcombudsperson.ca/)**.**
* **If you have a problem with what is and isn't covered by the Workers' Compensation Act:** **contact your MLA or Minister Harry Bains**. Examples: disability benefits end at retirement (this was introduced by the previous BC Liberal government), how much is paid to workers (90% of net with a cap for high income earners), lack of compensation for ""pain and suffering"" or ""quality of life"". These are all legislative, and there's nothing anyone can do about it unless legislation or policy is changed.
* **Union workers: contact your union**. Many unions have a compensation appeals department that can help you, and they will have integrated knowledge of any disability benefits you have access to. They may also be doing special work on a certain type of injury or have specialty knowledge on how to help workers in your industry get their claim accepted. For example, one union is including a Charter challenge to all claim appeals that fall in a certain category. The PFFA has worked with WSBC on the overall problem of hearing claims for Fire Chiefs always being denied.
* **Get help from friends and family.** You can authorize someone else to have claim access and do the talking with WorkSafeBC.
* **Follow your claim online or request claim disclosure.** You have a right to request and access almost all the information WorkSafeBC has about you. Staying up to date on everything can help.
* **Most workers in BC:** you can contact the [Workers' Advisers Office](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/personal-injury-and-workplace-safety) **for help dealing with WorkSafeBC**. Their scope is strictly limited to the Workers' Compensation Act, so don't contact them with non-WorkSafeBC-related issues. Prohibited Action Complaints, OHS issues, and compensation claim issues are all within their scope.",,,britishcolumbia,"Public Service Message: not all workers are governed by the same piece of legislation, so where you go for help is different depending on who you work for.",0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/133bk64/public_service_message_not_all_workers_are/

I'm calling the RTB tomorrow, however I'd like to know whether anyone else has dealt with a similar problem.

I've signed a 1 year lease for an apartment in May 2022. I'm moving out due to constant fire alarms and many other problems in the building that the building manager is not doing shit to address. 

I've given my notice on December 30th to vacate the unit on January 31st. I've even found a very decent person interested in taking over my current lease and offered this option to my landlord (and to vet them as well). They were able to move in on January 10th. 

Landlord refused and told me they're not interested in whoever I found to replace me. Fair. I was ready to pay for full month of January while they can show the unit to potential tenants as I'm pretty much moved out at this point, just need to sell off some furniture.

Their response was that they want me to pay rent for one full month of February as well due to this clause in the lease I signed: 

'If the tenant unilaterally ends the fixed term tenancy before the end of the fixed term, the Landlord may, at the Landlord's option treat this Agreement as being at an end. In such event, rent must be paid for the full month of notice given, plus the additional sum of another full month's rent on top, will be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord as Lease Break Liquidated Damages and not as a penalty to cover the administrative costs or re-renting of the rental unit.' 

I don't believe this is enforceable because of this policy guideline at [https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/residential-tenancies/policy-guidelines/gl04.pdf](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/residential-tenancies/policy-guidelines/gl04.pdf) : 

'A liquidated damages clause is a clause in a tenancy agreement where the parties agree in advance the damages payable in the event of a breach of the tenancy agreement. The amount agreed to must be a genuine pre-estimate of the loss at the time the contract is entered into, otherwise the clause may be held to constitute a penalty and as a result will be unenforceable.' 

I also found this at [https://tenants.bc.ca/your-tenancy/breaking-a-lease/](https://tenants.bc.ca/your-tenancy/breaking-a-lease/):   
'If your landlord is forced to re-rent your unit at a $25 discount to secure a replacement tenant, they could be entitled to $25 per month over the remaining term of your agreement. However, if your landlord can re-rent your unit for more than what you were paying, that additional money they will earn over the remaining months of your agreement can be or applied to, or “set off” against, any other money you owe your landlord for unpaid rent or damages. '

There's no way they can't find a new tenant by February 1st, as I live in Metro Vancouver and there's a high demand for apartments. Plus the rents went up - they will be able to re-rent the unit by at least $200-300 extra each month.

Would be happy for any feedback from you folks, thanks!",,,britishcolumbia,Breaking a fixed term tenancy lease with liquidated damages clause,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/102tbqp/breaking_a_fixed_term_tenancy_lease_with/

They're underpaid, overworked and treated like crap from the provincial leadership. (Still being mindful too that our provincial leadership is treating all of our Healthcare system like crap).  They're badly short handed and not really given the credit they're due. Police and Fire seem to always get given credit and respect wherever they go, but after talking to several Paramedics I know and have worked with (many have secondary jobs because the pay is literally nothing, im serious when I say its $2.xx per hour until they get a call, look it up. ) they feel the public has forgotten about them.

ranjitzu,,,,1671387049,,,zp4g43,,,,,,t3_zp4g43,35,,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/zp4g43/seton_lake_lillooet/,,,,"Hi folks,

I dont know if this kind of post is allowed here. If not, please let me know. Im wondering if anyone with a camera would help me out with something?

My wife and I were engaged in 2015 at Seton Lake near Lillooet. We havent had a chance to come back since (we are from Scotland).

We had limited time with an RV so we only spent a short time there. I wish we had spent a whole day, but alas, we were on our way the morning after we got engaged.

Nowadays we make it a habit to eat dinner with the tv playing something ambient. Think a forest, or a fire, waves crashing etc.

For our christmas dinner I had a thought that maybe I could find Seton Lake but no luck. 

So with that in mind, I am wondering if anyone would be willing to go to Seton Lake, set up a camera at the picnic tables there, looking out towards the water, and film a couple minutes of footage? 

I am a video editor so I can happily turn it into an hour long ambient thing, akin to what we usually have on.

Thanks for your time. :)

Edit: the response to this post has been incredible and I cannot thank the BC community enough for your help. In particular, four of you, who have sent existing footage or offered to go to Seton Lake to film some, and one person who ventured out to nearby Anderson Lake to get some footage for me. Thank you a million times! Christmas dinner is gonna be amazing this year and one day we'll be back with the family when we will stay a bit longer.

Edit 2: thank you to this wonderful commmunity for your help. In particular to u/drista and u/zuqwaylh who were able to provide the pieces needed.

More than 3 years later haven't been able to find work, have no source of income.

I did find work this year, one was a cashier at a thrift store (got through a disability placement from an organization)--the manager fired me after 4 hours because I couldn't handle the job, had a job as an editor--this one I quit because my boss was really angry at me for not being able to keep up with the work. Both jobs I disclosed my disability before I landed the position, but no one cares it seems.

I'm trying WorkBC again, have a different case manager, he's just making me go through all these different workshops, like resume, cover letter, told him I already know how to do these things, I've done these workshops over and over again.

Then we did another testing thing called a DRENA... and now I have no idea what we are doing... it's just workshop after workshop, testing, testing... questionnaires.

It's been about a year since she escaped and is working on healing mentally and emotionally and has not been on these ""spicy sites"" since.

Shes decided she wants to go back to school and pay the way through on her own. Shes thinking to become an ultrasound technician anywhere in BC once Shes finishes her program. But her concern is that she might be recognized for what she did and could potentially get fired from her future ultrasound job... I would assume one would have to really go looking for her to find out about her past and no one knew what she was doing, she was just trying to survive. Apparently, she didn't use her real name or email for anything, and nothing comes up unless we type in her ""stage name"" on google.

Can anyone foresee her running into any issues in her future now that she is trying to move on and rebuild her life? It would be nice to see her work as an ultrasound technician well into her older years as she is only 22 but we just don't want her ""past"" to haunt her. I've told her that it would probably be a violation of her worker's rights if she did lose her future job due to her past endeavors but I'm actually not sure... Ive heard of girls on these ""spicy sites"" paying for it later once they move on to other, real-world careers in life.

Me and my partner fly out from Toronto tomorrow to Abbotsford. We have visited many times, her father lives in the Province, and we will be staying in Chilliwack. 


Now on previous visits we have done a ton of hiking, however a bucket list item for me has always been to summit a mountain with a large amount of relief, to get that iconic view from the top. We have done long and difficult hikes before, and I've done my research for what to expect, so I'm not worried about the technical or physical demands of attempting it. However, since I am the more physically fit of the two of us, I wanted something that was both impressive but also not overly dangerous or difficult, and so decided we should climb Cheam Peak. I've also shown her the route, assured her it's not too arduous, it's relatively popular, not overly difficult, and is close to Chilliwack so won't require a massive treck to get to.


My main concern now is with the fire in Hope. I have no experience with wildfires in Ontario, and don't know the danger of hiking anywhere near them. My assumption is that since Cheam is 20+ Km from the fire, this would still be safe, but I am just guessing. Additionally I don't really know how smoky it will be. I would assume most.of the smoke will drift east with the prevailing winds, but that is just a guess. 


Any advice would be appreciated. I really do want to attempt the climb (weather dependent) but also don't want to get smoked out, put us in danger, or anything else.",,,britishcolumbia,Hiking question for a visitor,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/xciolr/hiking_question_for_a_visitor/

I live in southern Ontario, and considering moving to BC for the nature, scenery, and weather. However, we keep hearing about increasing wildfires which are only expected to get worse in the coming years. 

Just wondering how this impacts British Columbians on a day-to-day basis, and whether this should deter me from moving to BC? I would probably want to move either to Greater Vancouver Area, or near Victoria.

Ive always dreamt of road tripping through Canada and my partner is obsessed with Crater Lake, Oregon, USA.  

We decided to get married this year and are going to elope at Crater Lake! The plan was to drive straight down from Vancouver to Oregon, get married, then honeymoon in Canada, doing a Vancouver > Calgary road trip through the Rockies.

We have flights already booked. Landing in Vancouver, departing in Calgary. Hire car is also booked for pickup and dropoff in those locations. Marriage licence and permit is sorted as are a photographer and officiant for the ceremony.

No accommodation is booked, as we were going to figure that out on the way.

Im absolutely in pieces at the minute, the stress of everything is really getting to me. There is zero news in UK about the wildfire situation but I am aware of it.

Im worried we wont be able to find anywhere to stay, we wont be able to travel within Canada. We also need to travel from Vancouver through Washington to Oregon. Is that even possible right now??? 

Im also super aware that I dont want to be a tourist taking up any resources needed by locals.

Im this far away from pulling the plug on everything.

It was purchased through Delta and uses Delta as the first flight within the US, with West Jet operating the final two.

I was going to visit my girlfriend in Kelowna this week, but she evacuated and went to Calgary with family instead. I had a simple request for Delta: Let me keep my current times/flights but simply stop at Calgary and return from there rather than continue on the last flight to Kelowna. Their response? Trying to charge me anywhere from $800-2,100 USD to drop one flight-- more than the entirety of the original itinerary.

I explained to them that it is illegal for me to enter Kelowna. They said there is nothing they can do unless Delta posts a travel advisory/waiver for Kelowna, which is unlikely when they don't actually operate there. Unfortunately, they are refusing to acknowledge the BC travel advisory and will not work with tourists scheduled to fly there. It does not matter what the Canadian government says.

West Jet said there's nothing they can do yet because it's a Delta ticket. However, they have offered me some assistance, but only once travel is imminent (24 hours prior to my flight). So luckily I have options, but that unfortunately involves me tying up time and resources with a company that is actually trying to help others affected by this natural disaster with an emergency flexible cancel/change policy.

I thought it was important to draw attention to companies doing crappy things. Bottom line: Delta is using this disaster to make a quick buck, and it's disgusting.

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice. While I don't personally need it at this point (West Jet is cooperating, and I have travel insurance), hopefully it's useful for others. Just calling out a company for being awful. A broken system like this just makes an already difficult situation harder.

EDIT 2: My travel insurance covers getting me to my final destination, which I cannot get to. So it will cover getting my money back and getting me home, but it won't help with re-routing me to a different final destination. I'm at the mercy of Delta and West Jet, and West Jet has been a lot more cooperative.",,,britishcolumbia,Delta Airlines is refusing to acknowledge the wildfire travel restrictions,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/15w03dy/delta_airlines_is_refusing_to_acknowledge_the/

I'm not even as concerned about driving through those areas, since there are no road closures. But is it insensitive of my tourist ass to add another vehicle to the road being used by people fleeing the natural disaster?

I can no longer cancel anything that's already booked. Best I can do I just... not go... and lose the road trip I've been dreaming of for half of my life :S. Not sure if I'm overthinking this, or what is the alternative now.

I'm originally from Québec and am looking for a new place to settle in Canada. The west, for obvious reasons, has so much appeal, especially as someone who loves being outdoors and hiking. I would like to live in more rural areas. Unfortunately, there's a huge drawback that I just can't shake: wildfires. I would love to hear locals' experiences on what it's like to live in a place with an increasing number of wildfires due to climate change.

Here are my concerns:

How much do wildfires affect you? Either directly through evacuations or indirectly through air quality. 

How often is there poor air quality in your area? I have had a hard time finding resources online indicating yearly recorded number of days of poor air quality in the province. I plan to be outside working in the garden a lot and being active. As someone with asthma, I believe that many days with poor air quality would seriously affect my health.

A huge thank you to everyone who responded to my original post about our trip to the area in June - This community is great. We have made some changes to our travel route and wanted to share. We have had the flights and accommodations booked for some time but were able to make a few adjustments to the accommodations without an increase in cost. We also made sure that all ferry reservations were booked for the morning routes just in case there were issues and a later one was needed.

We have not made any specific bookings for activities yet. Instead we have made a list of possibilities for each day or area and, other than a few that will require booked appointments, are leaving it up to whatever we are up for on that particular day. We have no problem adding or dropping any ideas and honestly just doing this route and finding stuff on the way would be just as well. That being said, I would very much appreciate your help with additional suggestions of possible things to do or your thoughts/reviews on anything already listed that you think just aren't worth it.

I have started making a list of already suggested food spots but would love to hear more of your favorite places as well (especially your go to Asian food places and must have items). I know we are trying to get a lot in and could easily spend 1-2 weeks in many of these individual areas but are trying to make the most of our 2 weeks. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and provide your thoughts - you all have been awesome!!!

*A little background on my family: I am originally from Calgary and spent many years in Southern Alberta but have never been to Vancouver or the surrounding area and we have been wanting to go for many years. I currently work and live down in the States in Colorado. My family very much enjoys hiking and outdoor activities but we do not take many vacations. We all love museums, aquariums and anything to do with native culture as well as just enjoying and experiencing this beautiful world we live in. I have taken my girls back to Southern Alberta several times (I have to keep stocking up on my Canadian goods) and then they have been to California a few times. We are finally in a position to take a trip and this is what we chose to experience together.*

It's legal in BC. It would be like a landlord saying I can't have a beer or something. I'm not even talking about smoking in the suite (which is understandable), I'm talking about the ""NO DRUG USE"" postings you see all of the time. What does that even mean anyways? Does it extend to prescription drugs, or just the quote un quote ""bad drugs"" that boomers hate? IMO if I'm paying my rent I should be able to snort blow off of a hookers ass crack, so long as I'm not creating a disturbance or damaging the rental. Agree or disagree? I would love to hear some landlords chime in as well.

EDIT: I'm not speaking about smoking in the unit, which I totally understand why they wouldn't want, but more so the (literally usually capitalized in the ad) NO DRUG USE condition. To me that implies that they don't event want edibles or etc. being used. Obviously they'd have no way of knowing, but I just find it weird that BC landlords are trying to act like they're parenting a 14 year old or something when they come up with these rental ""rules.""
