I find that my emotional well-being is being influenced by the cooler temperatures and the infrequency of true Toronto summer conditions, which typically entail ample sunshine, comfortable humidity, and temperatures spanning from 27°C to 35°C. Additionally, the presence of warm evenings accompanied by a refreshing breeze is part of this ideal experience. Are there any statistical indications of a correlation between these factors?

The major factions histories n ideologies n shit. (Most are just their normal historical paths with certain changes, ie nothing till 1007 will change for the Griffonian Republic. This is also kinda a Q&A thing too)

Griffonian republic: After undergoing serious economic and military reform the Republic stands as one of the few beacons of harmonist democracy on the continent. After the Lord protector unified the herzland the Skyfall republic joined their northern neighbor in an attempt to stave off invasion whether it works is for the future to decide. President Kemerskai now deals with a refugee crisis after the fall of the Herzland and a gridlock congress determined for vengence but unsure at what time.

Griffonian empire: After the death of the emperor the empire was taken over by radical military forces in an attempt to save it. However instead they brought it to ruin, the lord protector Ferdinand dawnclaw has ruled the empire for 3 years and has just recently solidified his power, recently he has been speaking with Wingried Von katerinburg.

United. Socialist. River. States : following the election of Nova whirl the equestria of the east slowly turned red. Much like the trade routes socialism would follow spreading like wildfire to other parts of the Riverlands. In 1009 in an attempt to stave off the growing hostilities in the west all but one of the Coltstream treaty members, the diamond dogs, agreed to join the now born Socialist Federation. However almost as soon as the nation was born it faced trouble as Hector Lipizzan a staunch anti-communiust launched a revolt against the new federation. Carmel Haze a officer of the red army would soon seize the apparatus of State to maintain order however after dealing with the threat he did not step down and now rules as the chairpony of the east.

Aquelia: After being in war for over a year doesn't want to be in another but will of it must. Currently in the midst of electing its president its path is not yet decided.

Equus: Basically just the historical paths except for one nation.

The last city: After a terrible accident by scientists in the Crystal empire  the region of Polaria has been submerged in a blizzard that ranges from -70 to -130. It's up to the iron captain Jorik to make sure the iron city survives at all costs.

Republic of Aris: the history of Aris in recent years can be blamed one one person, the storm king. After a suprise attack that resulted in the death of queen Novo the Hippogriffs hid under the waves. For two years they sat afraid the traumatized queen Skystar sat waiting until the element bearers arrived.

During the battle of Ain Trotgourait Queen skystar was killed by a stay bullet thus ending the line of Novo as Silverstream fell later that day. With no future heirs to the throne the nation plummeted into chaos, after a brief interm military government headed by Marshal Skyranger, following a failed elite rule a republic was formed and elections were held in 1006 for a new leader.

On March 7th 1011 a date which shall live in infamy, the United forces of Colthage, Chiropterra and Wingbardy declared war on Aris determined to sink their fleet. Isolated and alone its up to president Frost Dare to rally the nation to arms and fight off the invaders.

Chiropterra: After Carrot Stick seized control of the country in 1007 and made his reforms, the small zebrican nation has industrialized heavily boosting the most modern military in the region. Although navally its nowhere on par with the Arisians their alliance with both Colthage and Wingbardy will see them hopefully clear a path to take equestria when the time comes, however many in the old guard see problems with this strick adherence to time tables, what if the Arisian navy is still a threat in 1012 when they agreed to attack equestria with the changlings? How many fronts can they afford to open.",,,equestriaatwar,Griffonia at war: As of 1010,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/equestriaatwar/comments/160h4dz/griffonia_at_war_as_of_1010/

However, my understanding of the climate of the Hawaiian islands is that the main islands usually have a 'dry side' due to rain shadows caused by mountains, and that Lahaina is in one of those rain shadows. This has resulted in the evolution of unique dry
ecosystems on the islands including on Maui, and specifically in the Lahaina area.

Per this page: http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/rainfall.html 

>In general, high mean rainfall is found on the windward mountain slopes, and low rainfall prevails in leeward lowlands and on the upper slopes of the highest mountains.

Per this map: https://livingonmauinow.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/maui-lifezone-map.jpg Lahaina is subtropical thorn woodland, a type of very dry ecosystem filled with plants adapted to dry conditions.

There's even nonprofit organizations dedicated to studying and raising public awareness of these dry ecosystems on the Hawaiian islands: https://www.drylandforest.org/

In this context, when people say Lahaina used to be lush, it confuses me. Was Lahaina initially irrigated with water from the wet side of the island? Was it initially dry, but became more dry? Even if there was irrigation which allowed for ponds or lush gardens, would it really change the fact that the whole area is very dry? Would it have really somehow fundamentally changed the area to such an extreme extent? In contemporary examples of dry areas receiving massive amounts of irrigation, like golf courses in Arizona or Nevada, the surrounding area is not any less dry. The irrigated portion is still very small compared to the surrounding area. Wooden structures in the area would still burn if a shower of embers were blown across them.

It seems to me like the nonnative grasses and perhaps a lack of brush clearing would be a much more significant factor than irrigation rerouting if the natural landscape was already dry to begin with. As well as issues with things like electric lines not being buried, electric lines not having available modifications to make them less likely to start a fire, electric companies not having power shutoff plans for periods of high wildfire risk, etc. All factors that could be at play in other dry areas, and therefore put other dry areas at risk.

It would make much more sense to me if the discussion of this issue - of what made Lahaina vulnerable to fire - included a general discussion of the fact that the Hawaiian islands do have many naturally dry areas which - just like Lahaina - are at increasing risk of catastrophic fire due to climate change, land mismanagement, poor infrastructure, and insufficient planning.

Would appreciate any feedback or clarification.",,,maui,"People online are blaming historical irrigation decisions for the Lahaina fire. I think this underestimates the extent that dry areas are naturally present on the Hawaiian islands, and therefore fails to recognize how many places are potentially at risk.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/160gku7/people_online_are_blaming_historical_irrigation/

From the jump, Fuwawa and Mococo were dead set on building a massive audience as quickly as possible. And a pivotal part of their debut strategy was immediately launching FuwaMoco Morning. The concept of a morning show isn’t anything new (Mio has one also) but they knew it would help them to REALLY get some exposure. 

With the show being only 30 minutes, people can watch on their daily commute to work or school or maybe during breakfast or between classes. It’s locked in EVERY Monday, Wednesday and Friday so everyone knows when to tune in. Also, it streams at a a time that’s friendly to JP and EU bros. That means even if you’re VOD gang, you can still probably catch a few livestreams.

Add in the fact that they’re doing Japanese streams, streaming literally every day, and staying as seiso as possible to appease YouTube and attract younger viewers, then it’s no surprise why FuwaMoco is already spreading like a wildfire.

These doggos feel like they’ve got something to prove (especially to everyone who doubted them) and I’m just excited to see them become huge Hololive talents.

Power dynamics are such a weird thing.
Talking to a friend and us both realizing that our ascent to power in our careers has been very different.

My friend (white) is very mild mannered he is kind of a push over(admittedly) he assumed his position of power in the same career as me, same position as me. He has had very little to no pushback for implementing new ideas and direction.

Myself? I have had to fight for the most basic shit for the last 3 years of my career(i’ve worked on two different forests in this span of time)  i have been constantly questioned, I have subordinates scream in my face. I’ve been told that I, the superior person in the chain of command need to compromise. I’ve been routinely ham strong by the people above me who tie my hands behind my back. And ask me to manage that way.

Talking to my friend about our very different climb in this career, has been so eye opening.

I thought that getting higher in this job it would change things.

My 2nd year in fire a person high up who I respected told me “people in this line of work are going to have a hard time taking orders from a nigger” that stung like hell. I remember it like it was yesterday. What stings worse is that 10 years later he is still being proven right everyday.

I’ve been physically attacked for being black and doing my job, i’ve been hate crimed in the middle of the woods, in the middle of a rural town. I could go on… but i wont.

I’ve been told i was the aggressor, i was the reason, that it was my fault. Truthfully i was the reason, it was the color of my skin.

These last few months in this job have been especially hard on me and i just needed somewhere to vent.

But i’m not special, this isnt just a problem i am facing.

If you are reading this I just want you to take a tactical pause. I want you to think if there was a time where you couldve stood up for someone who wasnt being treated unfairly, maybe it wasnt their skin color, but maybe it was their sex, or sexual orientation. If you failed them, i want you to atleast think about how you could do better in the future.

I dont want your pity, i want you to do better.

We have been at a severe wildfire interface for a week...we are just outside the evacuated zone, but are on constant official alert.  In housing people from the evacuated zone, I wanted to know about the accuracy of my indoor air quality due to the extra load. Aithings customer response was worse then zero...all I wanted to know was how long it took for the sensor to record a current reading...2.5 minutes or 7 days? When I sought help to interpret my high inside CO2 levels WRT real time accuracy accuracy, Airthings suggestion was to open a window or door!  In a wildfire LOL! As I had already put my view plus outside for an hour the readings of 330 PM and 2600 CO2 appeared far worse then my inside readings of 125 and 2100.

At best, I found in the technical manual that Aiwaves CO2 and PPM sensors take a week to register/calibrate.  If so, then what the heck good are the readings if they are only a weeks aggragate...so you can't rely on it to alert for a sudden increase in CO2 in your house..? Better have a back-up.

Can anyone suggest a home system that can give me real time measurements?  This sytem is not reliable for that. Also, besides bringing in all our outside potted plants...any ideas on how to reduce indoor CO2 levels?

Also Thumbs Up to Trane's Clean Effects system.  Based on whatever PPM number was being supplied, the trane unit, when run with the humidifier, brought PPM down effectively.

This week in Destiny, it’s witchy time! We’re hot off the heels of an exciting Showcase right before diving back into what’s next for Guardians. After all, we’ve got a Witness to nab, right?



Also, apologies in advance because Season of the Witch is very much my jam, so please excuse the puns and just know that each one is absolutely necessary. Thank you for your understanding.



Before we dive into what we’re chatting about this week, let’s recap what we shared in[ last week’s TWID](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/this-week-in-destiny-8-17):



* Guardians for Maui—support for Hawaii.
* A little Showcase teaser, as a treat.
* Twitch Drop it like it’s hot on August 22.
* We recapped some of the more epic moments in Destiny history.
* Season 22 Weapons Preview recap.
* Pick up your gear!
* Increased reputation gains all week.
* Regional pricing update.

Now for this week:



* Destiny 2 Showcase “remember when’s.”
* Guardians for Maui update.
* Calling all creators.
* Feeling nostalgic with older Seasons.
* Featured Quests, what are they?
* Three new Season 22 Strand Aspects and what they do.
* World First rundown.
* New Emblems, who dis?
* Player Support Report.
* #Destiny2AOTW and #Destiny2MOTW picks.

But first, a quick message from the team regarding the Showcase:



Thank you to everyone for tuning in to our Destiny 2 Showcase on Tuesday! This was a labor of love for everyone involved at Bungie, and we're excited to finally share so much of what we’ve been working on behind the scenes for The Final Shape, Season of the Witch, and our new Episodes with all of you.



We are aware there were some technical issues with audio and live subtitles in certain regions that may have impacted your viewing experience. We sincerely apologize to everyone affected by those issues, and we're taking steps to improve the experience in the future.



In the meantime, our Showcase videos are available to watch with corrected subtitles for all supported languages here, and we've also localized [our Showcase recap article](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap). Thanks as always for your support, and happy Season of the Witch!


##""And They Were *Broom-Mates*."" A Brief Showcase Recap.


Finally. Our time has come. Not only are we finally taking the fight to the Witness with The Final Shape, but we finally get to live our best witchy lives with Season of the Witch. From Eris returning front and center in all her epic glory to Cayde-6 bringing his miraculous self back into our lives, we’re excited to share in this journey with you all as we charge towards the conclusion of the most important fight in the hard-fought Light and Darkness saga.

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqIvKN4gtto)

Now that we’ve collectively gotten the excited giggles out of the way with Cayde-6's mysterious return, let’s do a brief recap into what’s on the way with The Final Shape and what started yesterday with Season 22: Season of the Witch. If you haven’t already, check out the Showcase recap [here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap).

The Pale Heart

The Pale Heart is duality at its finest, born from the Light, but also from the memories of the Darkness itself. This is the place that the Witness needed to get to last Season, which means we have to beat it to the punch with The Final Shape. What’s a little destruction among entire universes, am I right?

Fresh Supers and Exciting New Aspects

There will be three new Supers for Guardians to master, as well as three new Aspects. Warlocks will harness their inner Solar superbness with Song of Flame; Hunters will make Nikola Tesla proud with the power of Arc through Storm’s Edge; and Titans will bring the Void mayhem by hurling some big axes at enemies with Twilight Arsenal. Range. [chef’s kiss]



You can learn more about the new Supers [here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap).

New Enemies

As if the name didn’t give it away, the Subjugators are no joke, and they work at the Witness’s behest. There are two types, and both are experts on the battlefield. The first is a master of Stasis. They have the ability to slow, freeze, and shatter an opponent for certain death, but they also have the tactical chops to force any Guardians to weasel out of cover when in a fight. The other will use Strand against you. Their proximity mines suspend enemies and launch severing projectiles that dissolve their target into oblivion. They’re tricky, but we’ve faced tricky before. It’s what Guardians do.

Episodes and the Road Ahead

We’ve heard your feedback regarding the typical Seasonal model, so let’s try this on for size. Hear me out: Episodes. Instead of four Seasons in the year, we’ll be moving to three content drops instead. These will be bigger, more action-packed, and offer a fulfilling experience that players will want to take their time in. With the first three Episodes (Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy), players will contend with the aftermath of The Final Shape, with each Episode acting as a standalone narrative experience. More story beats? Check. More quests? Check. 200 Season Pass ranks? Check. New rewards? Check and check.



We’re excited to show you what’s next, so make sure you scope out the roadmap [here ](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap)to see everything that was announced yesterday, including details about the currently live Season of the Witch.


##Guardians for Maui - Campaign Update


In just a week, the Bungie community has rallied to support the people of Maui in the wake of the deadliest wildfires in over a century. To date, the community has purchased over 12,000 Mālama Maui shirts and 3,000 individual Kūlike Kākou emblems. All profits from the shirt and emblems will go to our long-time partner [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/hawaii-fires/?_gl=1*1yeuwjj*_up*MQ..&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgs2_2YLvgAMVtSOtBh1zBgy_EAAYASAAEgK47fD_BwE), supporting their emergency response and recovery operations in the region.

We are offering Guardians even more ways to support Maui moving forward. All profits from the Bungie Inclusion, Diversity, & Equity Association pins on the Bungie Store between August 17 and September 10 will be donated to the campaign as well. These include:

##Calling All Creators: Shoot That Shot


If you’re a content creator and you’ve asked yourself, “Self, how do I work with Bungie?” then you’re in the right place. Earlier this year, we welcomed [Chef Andy ](https://twitter.com/AndyLunique)to the team to lead efforts for the content creators and community leaders who work—and want to work—with us going forward. His team has the expertise and the compassion to help lead creators into fun new adventures with Bungie and the worlds we create.  



No matter your style or genre, Bungie wants to inspire and partner with you to make content for your audience and empower your communities. If joining us for new and familiar journeys in the future sounds right up your alley, then what are you waiting for? Shoot that shot and fill out our content creator form [right here](https://www.destinythegame.com/creators). Let’s chat, shall we?   


##Those Rewards Are *So* Last Season, But We Still Love 'Em


Later in Season of the Witch, we’re planning on bringing back a selection of cosmetic items from previous Season Passes to the Eververse, for players who missed out on acquiring them. We’ll be starting with a handful of items from **Season of the Worthy**. 



This nostalgic throwback, which we’re calling Seasonal Flashbacks, will only be available during weeks 4, 5, and 6. In the future, other Seasonal items may return, so if there are any coveted items you’d like to see again, shout them out to the @[Destiny2Team ](https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team)account as feedback. More info on future offerings at a later date.  


##Featured Quests: Like MySpace's Top 8 WIthout the Existential Dread


You’ll notice a new feature when looking at your in-game directory called Featured Quests. This is a quest log that gives you a little extra guidance on which questlines Destiny 2 thinks you should prioritize. The goal here is to make it a little easier to maneuver between content, no matter when it was released.  



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt27cd2edd471e4b28/64e787ac14f0613a93b3c4d9/MicrosoftTeams-image_(41).png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pWTBcTt.png)

Here’s a quick rundown on the Featured Quests section:  



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltc0983079ed3e9869/64e787b8cdda18855d226d00/MicrosoftTeams-image_(41).png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wsgQLNK.png)

* Players just starting out on their journey may only see a single quest at first until more content is unlocked.  
* Players who may have taken some time away from Destiny 2 may only see a few active quests, depending on how long they were away. 
* Returning players may have multiple ongoing quests, due to more recent activity.  
* Now, you can launch quests directly from the Featured Quests screen. The Director is cool and all, but not needed to jump right into your next adventure.  

[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blta8263c6ac07ed6e2/64e787c5af6c4b1e4f2d181d/MicrosoftTeams-image_(40).png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1YNvgun.png)

At the start, the most recent campaign and Seasonal quests will be prioritized in their respective categories. Players can also track quests, and then those will be prioritized to make them easier for Guardians to find. EZ PZ, witchy squeezy.  


##Go, Go, Power-er, Strand Aspects!


In addition to everything we’ve mentioned that’s coming up with new Supers, combat styles, and foes, we’ve also got three new Strand Aspects (one for each class) to play with. First up, you might be wondering: How do I get the new Aspects? That’s a great question, dear reader. If you've completed the Parting the Veil quest in Neomuna, go say hi to Nimbus. They'll give you a new quest to return to the Veil Containment for another message. Do this, and you'll obtain a new Strand Aspect.  



**Titan: Banner of War** 

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/19ghHr2ZIQM)

After you defeat an enemy with a melee attack (yes, that includes Glaives, Swords, finishers, or your Super’s melee) a Battle Standard is woven on the Berserker's back. The resulting animation pulses slowly to start, but gains tempo and extends the life of the Battle Standard as the player defeats (or assists in defeating) additional enemies. Allies can also charge the Battle Standard by getting kills while standing near the Berserker. 



Each beat sends out a healing pulse to allies in a 10-meter radius. While the Battle Standard is active, the Titan and nearby allies deal increased melee damage, too. Not to sound biased or anything as a Titan-main, but it’s kind of badass.  



**Hunter: Whirling Maelstrom** 

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxGiH1ymKKE)

With this new Aspect, destroying Tangles turns them into a whirling mass of Strands that seek out and damage nearby enemies (in addition to the normal Tangle explosion damage). Enemies within the Maelstrom take significant damage over time. The Maelstrom emits unraveling projectiles after defeating an enemy. After 15 seconds, the Maelstrom evaporates. 



**Warlock: Weavewalk** 

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KbrUGTPSP0)

Let’s break reality a bit with a fancy new air move that allows Warlocks to temporarily step into the weave. For the person playing the Warlock, this will appear as a darkened screen effect with a forest of Strand threads, while others will observe the Warlock using this Aspect as a mysterious green ghost. If you like the third-person perspective with Nova Warp, then you’ll enjoy this animation, too. It’s slick. Warlocks utilizing this Aspect are also highly resistant to damage during this time, although they can’t interact with the world. The time in a Weavewalk state varies depending on how many full melee charges the Warlock has when they activate Weavewalk. After all, life is about balance; what you get, you also have to be willing to give.  



While in the weave, Warlocks passively generate up to a maximum of five perched Threadlings (literally perched on and around the Warlock!) if the player does not end Weavewalk early by using another air move. 


##Grab Some Crotato Chips, We're Talkin' World First


You know the drill: Raid goodness just dropped, which means it's time to dive in and see what Crota's End has to offer now versus in the original Destiny. For those eager to take on Crota's End, whether it’s your first time or you're looking to enjoy some nostalgic fun, there are a few things you should know before diving into this fine raid weekend:  



* Contest Mode will be enabled for 48 hours. 

   * You will need to be at 1790 Power to be at the cap for all of the encounters to take the raid on.  
* Clearing the raid with Contest Mode active is the first step to access the Challenge Mode in the Director and the special Superior Swordplay Triumph with the challenges for each encounter.  
*  To complete the Superior Swordplay triumph, a fireteam must complete a curated list of challenges in this Challenge Mode and claim the triumph to snag that World First title and that sweet, sweet belt. 
* After completing Superior Swordplay, a fireteam must complete a curated list of challenges in this Challenge Mode to snag that World First title and get that sweet, sweet belt.   
* To enforce the Triumph requirements in Challenge Mode, your fireteam will wipe if you fail the success conditions during any encounter. 

For Crota’s End, we’ve made some tuning changes to Contest Mode, as summarized below. Our goal is to maintain a high bar of challenge for the launch event achievements, relative to the ever-expanding capabilities of players. 



* Increased the cap of player outgoing damage vs. combatants. Keep in mind that the incoming *damage cap* did not change. 
* Some enemies will gain elemental shields. 
* All enemies will be more aggressive than in the previous Contest Mode. 
##New Emblems, Who Dis? 


Don’t even play, we know that new emblem hype is real, so we figured since this was a big week of updates, why not share three new additions with #Destiny2MotW, #Destiny2AotW, and the new Destiny 2 fashion emblem.  



The snazzy new #Destiny2MotW emblem is like happiness in pixels with its bright colors and newness. *You can earn this one by tagging player-made videos with the above tag on all socials and our Creations page for a chance to snag it for yourself:*

The #Destiny2AotW emblem is also brand spankin’ new and has color blocking that would make your friend from art school proud. *You can earn this one by tagging player-made art (be it digital, paint, a cool sketch, cosplay, fiber arts—the sky is the limit!) with the above tag on all socials and our Creations page for a chance to add this to the ‘ol collection: *

And finally, we’ve got the latest fashion emblem. Those with that eye for style have a chance to win this new digital piece of awesomeness, and who doesn’t want a cute prism kitty to call their own? We’ll have more fun like this coming up, so stay tuned!

##Player Support Report


*Forget the Traveler, Eris is our god now.*



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt355cd313b88d8753/6345dc2e2d122610be62fb2c/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/X9qmSNk.gif)

It’s launch week, which means a new host of experiences to jump right into. To kick off Season of the Witch on the Player Support side, here is the latest in what you need to know about known issues and special reminders.  



[Known Issues List](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/13265980348564-Destiny-2-Year-6-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information)  |  [Help Forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&tSort=3&tType=0&d=0&lang=en)  |  [Bungie Help Twitter](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp)   

STEAM ENDING WINDOWS 7 AND 8 SUPPORT 

Starting January 1, 2024, Steam will officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. To continue running Steam and any games or other products purchased through Steam —including Destiny 2—players will need to update to a more recent version of Windows. For more information, please view [Steam’s article](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A). 

LOADOUTS DISABLED 

Due to an issue, we have temporarily disabled the Loadouts function. This will appear in-game as Loadouts being locked behind Guardian Ranks. Any existing Loadouts will be saved and available to all players who have already unlocked them once a fix can be deployed. 

FINISHER CHANGES 

With the launch of 7.2.0, the option to favorite cosmetics was added to the game. As a result of this implementation, the option to favorite Finishers in player inventories was deprecated. Players who would like to only use specific Finishers in gameplay can Store their Finishers in their Flair Collections. To obtain them again or to obtain other Finishers, players can reacquire them in their Collections under Flair > Finishers. 

KNOWN ISSUES  

While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help forum:  



* The description for Weavewalk fails to mention that players must have at least one full melee charge available in order to use the Aspect. Attempting to use Weavewalk without a full melee charge will not do anything. 
* The Unveiled quest can’t be completed if a player listens to the new lore in Veil Containment before acquiring the quest from Nimbus. 
* The Veteran’s Flair transmat effect is missing from player accounts. 
* The Origin Perk Specialization II artifact perk is not overcharging Season 22 weapons when the modifiers are active. 
* The Deck of Whispers Ascension VIII card scorches players abnormally fast. 
* Various Exotics in the Monument of Lost Light can’t be acquired, even if the player owns the correct DLC. 
* Infinite Quiver advertising art in the Eververse store is displayed using an incorrect shader. 
* The Volatile Throne bundle advertising art in the Eververse store is displayed using an incorrect weapon shader. 
* Unstoppable Taken Phalanx are immune to receiving damage from headshots. 
* Some players may have an Open Event Card popup stuck on their screen. 
* The Grandmaster Nightfall opening date says June 13. This is incorrect; the correct date is September 12. 
* The Phosphorescent shader currently visible in Collections is not an actual item, and instead was added to the game unintentionally. This will be removed in a future update. [Click here for more information](https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1694151930149503057). 
* Some players have reported not seeing the cutscene of Eris’s transformation. 
* The Defiant Ghost projection displays a projection from Season of the Witch. 
* Some players are reporting that the Clan Banner is not appearing for them even though they are already in a clan. Players can speak to Hawthrone in the Tower to reacquire their missing Clan Banner. 
* The Lectern of Divination is missing icons in the H.E.L.M. 
* The Hive portal in the H.E.L.M. is missing portions of its transportation technology. Players having issues going through the portal can slide to always go through the portal. 
* The Paracasual Path emblem does not appear in Collections. 
* There are various issues with the Crucible’s new Relic mode, such as “Relic energy charged” appearing multiple times in the feed and arrow waypoints persisting over depots after it despawns. 
* The Festival Dance emote has unintentionally changed to the Samba Dance. 
* Some players cannot purchase Ascendant Alloy or Enhancement Prisms from Rahool Special Orders if over the old holding limit. 

For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review [our Known Issues article](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/13265980348564-Destiny-2-Year-6-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&tSort=3&tType=0&d=0&lang=en). 


##Bring a Super Saiyan Eris to a Knife Fight

**Bruno**: Just because we gave Monte Carlo a new stabby catalyst doesn't mean you can start throwing weapons with pointy ends at your enemies like a Hunter—particularly Izanagi's Burden, although I have to admit it takes some *guts* to throw such a huge blade.  



**Movie of the Week**: Don't play with knives.

**Ivan**: This #Destiny2MOTW was created with passion, imagination, and a lot of love for both Destiny and anime. A sibling rivalry is a plot device we’ve seen in many anime movies before, but that doesn’t make it worse. Keep the good stuff coming, Guardians, and let your imagination take you anywhere it goes!

Whether you’re just happy to see Cayde-6 back or eager to kick some Witness butt, we hope you have a great time, and we can’t wait to see your reactions as the future unfolds.

This week in Destiny, it’s witchy time! We’re hot off the heels of an exciting Showcase right before diving back into what’s next for Guardians. After all, we’ve got a Witness to nab, right?



Also, apologies in advance because Season of the Witch is very much my jam, so please excuse the puns and just know that each one is absolutely necessary. Thank you for your understanding.



Before we dive into what we’re chatting about this week, let’s recap what we shared in[ last week’s TWID](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/this-week-in-destiny-8-17):



* Guardians for Maui—support for Hawaii.
* A little Showcase teaser, as a treat.
* Twitch Drop it like it’s hot on August 22.
* We recapped some of the more epic moments in Destiny history.
* Season 22 Weapons Preview recap.
* Pick up your gear!
* Increased reputation gains all week.
* Regional pricing update.

Now for this week:



* Destiny 2 Showcase “remember when’s.”
* Guardians for Maui update.
* Calling all creators.
* Feeling nostalgic with older Seasons.
* Featured Quests, what are they?
* Three new Season 22 Strand Aspects and what they do.
* World First rundown.
* New Emblems, who dis?
* Player Support Report.
* #Destiny2AOTW and #Destiny2MOTW picks.

But first, a quick message from the team regarding the Showcase:



Thank you to everyone for tuning in to our Destiny 2 Showcase on Tuesday! This was a labor of love for everyone involved at Bungie, and we're excited to finally share so much of what we’ve been working on behind the scenes for The Final Shape, Season of the Witch, and our new Episodes with all of you.



We are aware there were some technical issues with audio and live subtitles in certain regions that may have impacted your viewing experience. We sincerely apologize to everyone affected by those issues, and we're taking steps to improve the experience in the future.



In the meantime, our Showcase videos are available to watch with corrected subtitles for all supported languages here, and we've also localized [our Showcase recap article](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap). Thanks as always for your support, and happy Season of the Witch!


##""And They Were *Broom-Mates*."" A Brief Showcase Recap.


Finally. Our time has come. Not only are we finally taking the fight to the Witness with The Final Shape, but we finally get to live our best witchy lives with Season of the Witch. From Eris returning front and center in all her epic glory to Cayde-6 bringing his miraculous self back into our lives, we’re excited to share in this journey with you all as we charge towards the conclusion of the most important fight in the hard-fought Light and Darkness saga.

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqIvKN4gtto)

Now that we’ve collectively gotten the excited giggles out of the way with Cayde-6's mysterious return, let’s do a brief recap into what’s on the way with The Final Shape and what started yesterday with Season 22: Season of the Witch. If you haven’t already, check out the Showcase recap [here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap).

The Pale Heart

The Pale Heart is duality at its finest, born from the Light, but also from the memories of the Darkness itself. This is the place that the Witness needed to get to last Season, which means we have to beat it to the punch with The Final Shape. What’s a little destruction among entire universes, am I right?

Fresh Supers and Exciting New Aspects

There will be three new Supers for Guardians to master, as well as three new Aspects. Warlocks will harness their inner Solar superbness with Song of Flame; Hunters will make Nikola Tesla proud with the power of Arc through Storm’s Edge; and Titans will bring the Void mayhem by hurling some big axes at enemies with Twilight Arsenal. Range. [chef’s kiss]



You can learn more about the new Supers [here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap).

New Enemies

As if the name didn’t give it away, the Subjugators are no joke, and they work at the Witness’s behest. There are two types, and both are experts on the battlefield. The first is a master of Stasis. They have the ability to slow, freeze, and shatter an opponent for certain death, but they also have the tactical chops to force any Guardians to weasel out of cover when in a fight. The other will use Strand against you. Their proximity mines suspend enemies and launch severing projectiles that dissolve their target into oblivion. They’re tricky, but we’ve faced tricky before. It’s what Guardians do.

Episodes and the Road Ahead

We’ve heard your feedback regarding the typical Seasonal model, so let’s try this on for size. Hear me out: Episodes. Instead of four Seasons in the year, we’ll be moving to three content drops instead. These will be bigger, more action-packed, and offer a fulfilling experience that players will want to take their time in. With the first three Episodes (Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy), players will contend with the aftermath of The Final Shape, with each Episode acting as a standalone narrative experience. More story beats? Check. More quests? Check. 200 Season Pass ranks? Check. New rewards? Check and check.



We’re excited to show you what’s next, so make sure you scope out the roadmap [here ](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-showcase-2023-recap)to see everything that was announced yesterday, including details about the currently live Season of the Witch.


##Guardians for Maui - Campaign Update


In just a week, the Bungie community has rallied to support the people of Maui in the wake of the deadliest wildfires in over a century. To date, the community has purchased over 12,000 Mālama Maui shirts and 3,000 individual Kūlike Kākou emblems. All profits from the shirt and emblems will go to our long-time partner [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/hawaii-fires/?_gl=1*1yeuwjj*_up*MQ..&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgs2_2YLvgAMVtSOtBh1zBgy_EAAYASAAEgK47fD_BwE), supporting their emergency response and recovery operations in the region.

We are offering Guardians even more ways to support Maui moving forward. All profits from the Bungie Inclusion, Diversity, & Equity Association pins on the Bungie Store between August 17 and September 10 will be donated to the campaign as well. These include:

##Calling All Creators: Shoot That Shot


If you’re a content creator and you’ve asked yourself, “Self, how do I work with Bungie?” then you’re in the right place. Earlier this year, we welcomed [Chef Andy ](https://twitter.com/AndyLunique)to the team to lead efforts for the content creators and community leaders who work—and want to work—with us going forward. His team has the expertise and the compassion to help lead creators into fun new adventures with Bungie and the worlds we create.  



No matter your style or genre, Bungie wants to inspire and partner with you to make content for your audience and empower your communities. If joining us for new and familiar journeys in the future sounds right up your alley, then what are you waiting for? Shoot that shot and fill out our content creator form [right here](https://www.destinythegame.com/creators). Let’s chat, shall we?   


##Those Rewards Are *So* Last Season, But We Still Love 'Em


Later in Season of the Witch, we’re planning on bringing back a selection of cosmetic items from previous Season Passes to the Eververse, for players who missed out on acquiring them. We’ll be starting with a handful of items from **Season of the Worthy**. 



This nostalgic throwback, which we’re calling Seasonal Flashbacks, will only be available during weeks 4, 5, and 6. In the future, other Seasonal items may return, so if there are any coveted items you’d like to see again, shout them out to the @[Destiny2Team ](https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team)account as feedback. More info on future offerings at a later date.  


##Featured Quests: Like MySpace's Top 8 WIthout the Existential Dread


You’ll notice a new feature when looking at your in-game directory called Featured Quests. This is a quest log that gives you a little extra guidance on which questlines Destiny 2 thinks you should prioritize. The goal here is to make it a little easier to maneuver between content, no matter when it was released.  



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt27cd2edd471e4b28/64e787ac14f0613a93b3c4d9/MicrosoftTeams-image_(41).png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pWTBcTt.png)

Here’s a quick rundown on the Featured Quests section:  



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltc0983079ed3e9869/64e787b8cdda18855d226d00/MicrosoftTeams-image_(41).png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wsgQLNK.png)

* Players just starting out on their journey may only see a single quest at first until more content is unlocked.  
* Players who may have taken some time away from Destiny 2 may only see a few active quests, depending on how long they were away. 
* Returning players may have multiple ongoing quests, due to more recent activity.  
* Now, you can launch quests directly from the Featured Quests screen. The Director is cool and all, but not needed to jump right into your next adventure.  

[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blta8263c6ac07ed6e2/64e787c5af6c4b1e4f2d181d/MicrosoftTeams-image_(40).png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1YNvgun.png)

At the start, the most recent campaign and Seasonal quests will be prioritized in their respective categories. Players can also track quests, and then those will be prioritized to make them easier for Guardians to find. EZ PZ, witchy squeezy.  


##Go, Go, Power-er, Strand Aspects!


In addition to everything we’ve mentioned that’s coming up with new Supers, combat styles, and foes, we’ve also got three new Strand Aspects (one for each class) to play with. First up, you might be wondering: How do I get the new Aspects? That’s a great question, dear reader. If you've completed the Parting the Veil quest in Neomuna, go say hi to Nimbus. They'll give you a new quest to return to the Veil Containment for another message. Do this, and you'll obtain a new Strand Aspect.  



**Titan: Banner of War** 

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/19ghHr2ZIQM)

After you defeat an enemy with a melee attack (yes, that includes Glaives, Swords, finishers, or your Super’s melee) a Battle Standard is woven on the Berserker's back. The resulting animation pulses slowly to start, but gains tempo and extends the life of the Battle Standard as the player defeats (or assists in defeating) additional enemies. Allies can also charge the Battle Standard by getting kills while standing near the Berserker. 



Each beat sends out a healing pulse to allies in a 10-meter radius. While the Battle Standard is active, the Titan and nearby allies deal increased melee damage, too. Not to sound biased or anything as a Titan-main, but it’s kind of badass.  



**Hunter: Whirling Maelstrom** 

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxGiH1ymKKE)

With this new Aspect, destroying Tangles turns them into a whirling mass of Strands that seek out and damage nearby enemies (in addition to the normal Tangle explosion damage). Enemies within the Maelstrom take significant damage over time. The Maelstrom emits unraveling projectiles after defeating an enemy. After 15 seconds, the Maelstrom evaporates. 



**Warlock: Weavewalk** 

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KbrUGTPSP0)

Let’s break reality a bit with a fancy new air move that allows Warlocks to temporarily step into the weave. For the person playing the Warlock, this will appear as a darkened screen effect with a forest of Strand threads, while others will observe the Warlock using this Aspect as a mysterious green ghost. If you like the third-person perspective with Nova Warp, then you’ll enjoy this animation, too. It’s slick. Warlocks utilizing this Aspect are also highly resistant to damage during this time, although they can’t interact with the world. The time in a Weavewalk state varies depending on how many full melee charges the Warlock has when they activate Weavewalk. After all, life is about balance; what you get, you also have to be willing to give.  



While in the weave, Warlocks passively generate up to a maximum of five perched Threadlings (literally perched on and around the Warlock!) if the player does not end Weavewalk early by using another air move. 


##Grab Some Crotato Chips, We're Talkin' World First


You know the drill: Raid goodness just dropped, which means it's time to dive in and see what Crota's End has to offer now versus in the original Destiny. For those eager to take on Crota's End, whether it’s your first time or you're looking to enjoy some nostalgic fun, there are a few things you should know before diving into this fine raid weekend:  



* Contest Mode will be enabled for 48 hours. 

   * You will need to be at 1790 Power to be at the cap for all of the encounters to take the raid on.  
* Clearing the raid with Contest Mode active is the first step to access the Challenge Mode in the Director and the special Superior Swordplay Triumph with the challenges for each encounter.  
*  To complete the Superior Swordplay triumph, a fireteam must complete a curated list of challenges in this Challenge Mode and claim the triumph to snag that World First title and that sweet, sweet belt. 
* After completing Superior Swordplay, a fireteam must complete a curated list of challenges in this Challenge Mode to snag that World First title and get that sweet, sweet belt.   
* To enforce the Triumph requirements in Challenge Mode, your fireteam will wipe if you fail the success conditions during any encounter. 

For Crota’s End, we’ve made some tuning changes to Contest Mode, as summarized below. Our goal is to maintain a high bar of challenge for the launch event achievements, relative to the ever-expanding capabilities of players. 



* Increased the cap of player outgoing damage vs. combatants. Keep in mind that the incoming *damage cap* did not change. 
* Some enemies will gain elemental shields. 
* All enemies will be more aggressive than in the previous Contest Mode. 
##New Emblems, Who Dis? 


Don’t even play, we know that new emblem hype is real, so we figured since this was a big week of updates, why not share three new additions with #Destiny2MotW, #Destiny2AotW, and the new Destiny 2 fashion emblem.  



The snazzy new #Destiny2MotW emblem is like happiness in pixels with its bright colors and newness. *You can earn this one by tagging player-made videos with the above tag on all socials and our Creations page for a chance to snag it for yourself:*

The #Destiny2AotW emblem is also brand spankin’ new and has color blocking that would make your friend from art school proud. *You can earn this one by tagging player-made art (be it digital, paint, a cool sketch, cosplay, fiber arts—the sky is the limit!) with the above tag on all socials and our Creations page for a chance to add this to the ‘ol collection: *

And finally, we’ve got the latest fashion emblem. Those with that eye for style have a chance to win this new digital piece of awesomeness, and who doesn’t want a cute prism kitty to call their own? We’ll have more fun like this coming up, so stay tuned!

##Player Support Report


*Forget the Traveler, Eris is our god now.*



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt355cd313b88d8753/6345dc2e2d122610be62fb2c/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/X9qmSNk.gif)

It’s launch week, which means a new host of experiences to jump right into. To kick off Season of the Witch on the Player Support side, here is the latest in what you need to know about known issues and special reminders.  



[Known Issues List](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/13265980348564-Destiny-2-Year-6-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information)  |  [Help Forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&tSort=3&tType=0&d=0&lang=en)  |  [Bungie Help Twitter](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp)   

STEAM ENDING WINDOWS 7 AND 8 SUPPORT 

Starting January 1, 2024, Steam will officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. To continue running Steam and any games or other products purchased through Steam —including Destiny 2—players will need to update to a more recent version of Windows. For more information, please view [Steam’s article](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A). 

LOADOUTS DISABLED 

Due to an issue, we have temporarily disabled the Loadouts function. This will appear in-game as Loadouts being locked behind Guardian Ranks. Any existing Loadouts will be saved and available to all players who have already unlocked them once a fix can be deployed. 

FINISHER CHANGES 

With the launch of 7.2.0, the option to favorite cosmetics was added to the game. As a result of this implementation, the option to favorite Finishers in player inventories was deprecated. Players who would like to only use specific Finishers in gameplay can Store their Finishers in their Flair Collections. To obtain them again or to obtain other Finishers, players can reacquire them in their Collections under Flair > Finishers. 

KNOWN ISSUES  

While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help forum:  



* The description for Weavewalk fails to mention that players must have at least one full melee charge available in order to use the Aspect. Attempting to use Weavewalk without a full melee charge will not do anything. 
* The Unveiled quest can’t be completed if a player listens to the new lore in Veil Containment before acquiring the quest from Nimbus. 
* The Veteran’s Flair transmat effect is missing from player accounts. 
* The Origin Perk Specialization II artifact perk is not overcharging Season 22 weapons when the modifiers are active. 
* The Deck of Whispers Ascension VIII card scorches players abnormally fast. 
* Various Exotics in the Monument of Lost Light can’t be acquired, even if the player owns the correct DLC. 
* Infinite Quiver advertising art in the Eververse store is displayed using an incorrect shader. 
* The Volatile Throne bundle advertising art in the Eververse store is displayed using an incorrect weapon shader. 
* Unstoppable Taken Phalanx are immune to receiving damage from headshots. 
* Some players may have an Open Event Card popup stuck on their screen. 
* The Grandmaster Nightfall opening date says June 13. This is incorrect; the correct date is September 12. 
* The Phosphorescent shader currently visible in Collections is not an actual item, and instead was added to the game unintentionally. This will be removed in a future update. [Click here for more information](https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1694151930149503057). 
* Some players have reported not seeing the cutscene of Eris’s transformation. 
* The Defiant Ghost projection displays a projection from Season of the Witch. 
* Some players are reporting that the Clan Banner is not appearing for them even though they are already in a clan. Players can speak to Hawthrone in the Tower to reacquire their missing Clan Banner. 
* The Lectern of Divination is missing icons in the H.E.L.M. 
* The Hive portal in the H.E.L.M. is missing portions of its transportation technology. Players having issues going through the portal can slide to always go through the portal. 
* The Paracasual Path emblem does not appear in Collections. 
* There are various issues with the Crucible’s new Relic mode, such as “Relic energy charged” appearing multiple times in the feed and arrow waypoints persisting over depots after it despawns. 
* The Festival Dance emote has unintentionally changed to the Samba Dance. 
* Some players cannot purchase Ascendant Alloy or Enhancement Prisms from Rahool Special Orders if over the old holding limit. 

For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review [our Known Issues article](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/13265980348564-Destiny-2-Year-6-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&tSort=3&tType=0&d=0&lang=en). 


##Bring a Super Saiyan Eris to a Knife Fight

**Bruno**: Just because we gave Monte Carlo a new stabby catalyst doesn't mean you can start throwing weapons with pointy ends at your enemies like a Hunter—particularly Izanagi's Burden, although I have to admit it takes some *guts* to throw such a huge blade.  



**Movie of the Week**: Don't play with knives.

**Ivan**: This #Destiny2MOTW was created with passion, imagination, and a lot of love for both Destiny and anime. A sibling rivalry is a plot device we’ve seen in many anime movies before, but that doesn’t make it worse. Keep the good stuff coming, Guardians, and let your imagination take you anywhere it goes!

Whether you’re just happy to see Cayde-6 back or eager to kick some Witness butt, we hope you have a great time, and we can’t wait to see your reactions as the future unfolds.

In the middle of the lockdown, she posts an engagement ring and a bouquet of roses on social media. We figured they would wait until after the lockdowns to get married, especially since the bride and her family are religious and a religious ceremony would have been important to her. 

A few weeks later, my mom tells me that a bunch of bride’s extended family were posting photos and livestreams of her backyard wedding. This was summer 2020, hundreds of people were dying of covid, vaccines were being researched and parties were superspreader events. There were people who lived 7 hours away so it’s not like it was a small party either. 

The bride didn’t post anything about her wedding. I think she was trying to keep it on the low so her job wouldn’t find out, but so many of her family members were posting about it that it didn’t matter. 

That same week, a nearby beach town that’s surrounded by forests was experiencing wildfires. Local fire departments were asking non-locals to stay out so the 3 highways (that are all surrounded by forest) could be used to evacuate locals and bring firefighters from surrounding cities. The day after the wedding, the bride posted a photo of the beach with a hazy orange sky in the background. 

In the year following the wedding, the bride and her mom would constantly post about the groom and how much he helped with stuff. At one point, the bride bragged that they “aren’t lazy” and posted a photo of her and the groom scrubbing grout on a tile floor by hand.  Now, they never post about him and all photos of the wedding are gone. Knowing how secretive they are about things, and I strongly suspect they split up.",,,weddingshaming,"Bride & groom break COVID-19 guidelines and honeymoon in an active wildfire zone, now they’re divorced",0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/160891a/bride_groom_break_covid19_guidelines_and/

Felt like I took it a bit slower than even my usual slow pace; I'm in NJ, and there was definite wildfire smoke on the air this morning, but not enough to be significantly uncomfortable.

After the 5 min warm-up walk, the first 2-3 minutes of running are nearly always a challenge for me - my body tries so hard to convince my brain that it can't do it, but fortunately, by now, my brain knows better.  (It's all okay, though, because usually, later in the run, my brain starts trying to convince my body that it can't do it, and my body tells it 'tough you-know-what; you didn't let me quit, so I'm not letting you."")  So anyway... I felt like I got off to a slow start.  Felt like I did a decent job managing effort throughout.  Caught a great second wind at about the 9-10 minute mark of the 22 minutes which carried me for the bulk of the middle-stretch and didn't really feel too taxing until the last 3-minutes or so, but even that wasn't too bad.

I did my usual 5 minute cooldown and still had a fair distance to walk back home, so I ended up doing my own additional two 4 min intervals at the end with about a 2 min walk in the middle and a 5 min walk to finally cool down and get me home.

All-in-all, I thought it was a great run.  Moderate effort, didn't feel bad when done, still had some energy in the tank, and then I checked my apps - I always run an Apple Watch Outdoor Run while doing C25k, and my AW exercise app writes to Strava just because I enjoy seeing my routes and segments and stuff.  When I checked Strava I was really pleasantly surprised to see that I had hit my PR for 5k with 39:46 - definitely my first-ever sub 40-min 5k.    


I can't wait to see where the next few weeks will take me.  Carrying on for the full 14 week 10K program this time, so fingers crossed that the progress continues.

&#x200B;

Happy running, everybody!",,,C25K,Week 6 Day 3 Came With A Nice Surprise,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/1608344/week_6_day_3_came_with_a_nice_surprise/

merlinsbeardio,,,,1692895867,,,1607ccn,,,,,,t3_1607ccn,4,,/r/beyondthebump/comments/1607ccn/motivation_for_selfcare/,,,,"FTM mom, my daughter is 5mo and I’m on maternity leave until April. 

Being at home all day has never been awesome for my mental state (WFH during covid was not a good scene for me). Being a mom is a lot more fun than my old job, but it’s harder, and find myself falling into a rut where any down time I have (my daughter napping or playing on her own), I spend scrolling because my brain is tired. I  listen to podcasts while I do light chores, which I enjoy, but if the chores are done and I can just chill, I don’t do yoga or read or anything that would actually make me feel better. 

And I do have more downtime than I used to. My baby is starting to nap longer in her crib (I have to help her go back to sleep after 30-40 minutes, but as of a couple of days ago, this actually works most of the time) and her playtime is longer, but I find it hard to get into something that I enjoy knowing that I could be interrupted at any moment. 

Getting out with her is totally doable but it’s obviously more work than not and often I’m just like nah we’re staying home because of the mental gymnastics of timing her naps and feeds around an outing. Managing someone else’s basic human functions is so boring and so draining. 

It’s been a hard few weeks, there have been lots of wildfires where I live so it’s been too smoky to take her outside. Plus the last couple of days I’ve been doing all the evening childcare, which my husband normally does, because he had to work late and had plans. (I want to be super clear, this is NOT a useless husband post. He’s a very hands -on parent and when he takes baby-free time he insists I do as well). So things feel a bit extra dark right now. 

How do you keep yourselves sane at home all the time? I need to figure this one out, daycare spaces are very limited and I may end up being a SAHM long-term. If you don’t have any suggestions, solidarity would also be appreciated. 

There are things that help (yoga, reading, meditation), it’s just finding the energy and motivation to do them that’s my struggle.",,,beyondthebump,Motivation for self-care,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1607ccn/motivation_for_selfcare/

I will add my opinions as well, for I don't care for objectivity \^\^

Taylorliz, P1kapeach and Cozmo are asking questions (two influencers, one Community Lead), Dan MCauliffe and Joe Blackburn are answering.

Q: What are you most excited for. Dan: The Supers, apparently they are not finished yet, so he is excited to see the final product. 

Joe: Weapons, they definitely want to make the new ones useful and admits weapons are the core of D2. Me: Joe's is the hardest because, well, making support weapons useful is hard, don't need healing in low level content, and get oneshot in high level stuff.

Q: Linear Destination, what exactly and why? 

Joe: Classic destinations are a loop, with some offshoots, doesn't work with the pale heart of the traveller. It's build as a line with the portal at one end, and the Monolith on the other, focused on progression and ""you've got a job to do"".

Q: During the showcase said that clear of TFS would unlock full destination, and that it reacts as we progress, is that what you are saying? Joe: Two things: First, normal experience of a location is doing the first mission and then you can do other stuff, they don't want that for TFS, you have a job to do. Mission focus, otherwise playing coy (because they wanna keep up the mystery) but hinting at a lot of other things to do. Dan: Saying that the location will give us some more info on what the traveller is exactly (but otherwise also coy) Joe: It's shaped by the people that are there, so while some parts might look familiar (like the D1 tower) a lot of changes and new locales as well.

Q: We got feedback from players who wanted to learn about the origins of the Witness and the Veil during LF rather than wait for later on during the seasons [Notes: lmao] so players have big narrative expectations and how are you going to take the feedback? 

Dan: Very vague ""we have to land it very well, the players deserve it, the team deserves it so there are some things we are doing to account for that"", but in addition they want to set up the new stories. But what they explicitly stated is that they did more with the writers room than before and even involved other parts of the studio [whatever that means in this case \^\^]. They wanna make sure that people get the answers to the questions that they are asking, ""except for the pieces of future stories we want to tell"". 

Joe: They are very clear they know the expectations. They also know that the Witness is the biggest bad, want to be sure that he's not ""tough, but second to Val Ca'our"". The campaign of TFS is supposed to be the penultimate episode with the raid finishing it. Next part is a bit weird because they are playing coy again. Essentially raid is supposed to be very hard but also everyone is supposed to be along for the journey? [My guess is clearing the raid or even just encounters of it unlocks cutscenes/stuff in the world?] 

Dan: They want the campaign to be enjoyable by new players, but be far better if you have played everything before.

Q: So if I want the story I will have to play the raid? 

Joe: No. Essential piece of the story in the raid, but everyone, not just raiders, get to see the end. [very coy once again. I'm pretty certain that this is partially studio mandate for them to remain quiet about the details]

Q: We saw clips of the subjugators, are they going to be as terrifying as the Tormentors? What set's them apart? 

Joe: ""Tormentors are kind of like that cool aid man that bust's through the walls 'ahh look at me' right?"", Subjugators come in on large battlefields and play more of a tactician role. They can give all enemies pyramid buddies (essentially arc soul but darkness based). Focus on them being rare but always ""oh f*uck"" moments. Need a very different approach to Tormentors.

Q: Cayde-6 is back, can we get more info on that? 

Dan: Cayde-6 is back for this fight [this clearly seems to be implying he might not be back truly or permanently... which is good imo \^\^]. He's our guide through the pale heart. ""And some other stuff we're not gonna talk about"".

Q: The seasonal model has become predictable, and we saw in the showcase that it's change. Pls explain episodes. 

Dan: Natural evolution of the seasonal model. They claim they did some good stuff with it, but it's biased towards consistency and stretched out to it's utilities. By having 3 major storybeats but at total of 9 minor ones allows more time to breathe, but also change things up a bit more often. The six weeks between major storybeats allows players to play more how it fits in their lives [This seems to imply that it won't be weekly missions but every 6 weeks you get a bigger batch of stuff to do at your own leisure], allows them to experiment and amp up the variety.

Q: Reward track? 

Joe: [Starts off on a tangent lmao, but he returns to the question later] They don't want to tell competing stories with TFS and echoes and want the episodes to be reactions to the events [for me the first three sound like 'epilogues' what the consequences of the Witnesses defeat (maybe? \^\^) are for the world]. The actual episode starts the reset after the raid [which I fully support and it will improve hte narrative of TFS]. Reward track is instantly available though. (Also the episodal exotic is Red Death, is a solar weapon now). Teasing a new weapon sub-archetype during episodes. They want the rewards available instantly but the actual meat of the narrative only after TFS is finished. 

Dan: Still gonna run season passes alongside episodes [call them episode passes you cowards \^\^]. First act has 100 ranks, the other two add 50 each. Joe: each addition has it's own unique rewards, and at the very end some unique stuff. Hinting that they might have some truly universal ornaments (like the tiger helmet that every class could equip).

Q: Artifact perks? 

Joe: Same rows and columns as now during the first act, but each act adds a new row. Acts aren't just supposed to be new activities and narrative but also meta changes, new rewards, new ways to play, new nightfall rewards. Supposed to make D2 feel more refreshing and evolving.

Q: What's gonna happen after the first three episodes, what's going to happen afterwards? 

Dan: ""You're going to get less than you asked for"" [lmao coy once again], Episodes are the new framework and wanna experiment with making them more standalone, not all of them need to be connected. After Episode three they wanna tell new stories and learn from the first three. 

Joe: We still have a lot of people working on D2 and they have a lot of stuff they want to make for the players, Admits to the coyness \^\^.

Q: What are some changes that make it easier for my friends to get into the game? [For much as I enjoy D2, I wouldn't be a good friend if I recommended it to my friends lmao] 

Dan: Admitting that playing with friends is the best way to play it thus they are trying to add and improve those capabilities is their goal. Current things they can talk about are Fireteam Finder, Fireteam Power, Timeline Reflections [played through them, and while I like the idea they could do more here (chances are they will because it seems very much like work in progress, with the current ones being necessary because TFS will end the Light and Dark Saga, thus new players should get more context)] 

Joe: The update to the quest page is supposed to make the main stuff clearer with the big current one and a smaller one being featured [I personally am not a big fan of it because it looks ugly as sin, but I get the idea]. Have a group that is supposed to improve new player experience. Guardian Ranks did some good stuff for the new player experience apparently, but they don't give story information, which Timeline Reflections is supposed to help with. Also byf shoutout.

Q: How does Fireteam power work? 

Joe: Two ways power works going forward.

Power fixed: free roam destinations, regular strikes, base version of exotic missions, the story of final shape is power fixed (because they can balance it easier if they know the power level)

Power enabled activities: Aspirational stuff like raids, dungeons, trials. But if you still want to experience things even though you couldn't/wouldn't play destiny for a while and are under power, then fireteam power kicks in. Whenever you are in a fireteam during a power enabled activity it looks for the player with the highest power and puts you 5 under that.

Q: What about Trials? 

Joe and Dan: There is a reason to keep power on in Trials so it's a fair playing field. We will experiment with fireteam power during it later, but will clearly state it beforehand though.

Q: How's LFG working. 

Mostly for newer players or players that never figured the other LFG sites out. Can either have full random or need to approve before. You can use the fireteam finder either from the roster, or use it in the activity screen (were curently add fireteam member is). They won't act against the other LFG sites, if you have a community there, great use it.

Q: What does this mean for Guided Games? 

Joe: The guided games beta might be coming to an end [lmao], the fireteam finder is a far better version for finding groups.

Q: Strange Coin and Xur revamp? Joe mentioned it last week and that he might talk about it or the HUD revamp during the post show, so talk. 

Joe: Starting with Strange Coins, they want Xur more exciting. Currently it's only for newer players but players who play every week barely care about his inventory anymore. Want to make Strange Coins come from Ritual activities. They want to go back to Xur having exclusive things that might not be coming back anytime soon. Making it a choice if it's worth your Strange Coins. Hud is next, they want to make it easier to parse and make sure you can always see the mechanics ones. Want to make it clearer what's from your guardian, what's from environment/enemies, and what's going to kill you if you don't do the mechanics.

Q: As they expand out, working on new projects some fans think that it might take away resources from D2. What haz you say about that? 

Dan: We still have a great talented team, very deliberate who moves over and who stays. And they hire new people for the different projects. Talking about all the stuff they have planned and that their D2 teams still wants to work on D2 very much. [most PR speak part of the Q&A but... that's to be expected from this question lol]

Q: New Supers? Starting with Warlock. 

Joe: They want to make sure it's a viable alternative to well as they are aware that often Warlocks get forced to be the well bitch [choice of words mine here \^\^]. There will be no self-res. Want to keep the first person guns blazing experience. Scorch from normal attacks is the biggest DPS increase (combined with the bird grenade naturally having high damage) as everybody cases explosions. Still working on which damage types get the additional scorch.

Q: Hunter super looks a lot like blade dancer? 

Joe: They wanted the blades back but Arc Strider is already to similar to blade dancer. The teleportation idea was fun during playtest and they are dialing the numbers in to make it strong, but especially in crucible not completely oppressive. Also talks about the Aspect, apparently there are ways to add a charge and make you jump way to much.

Q: Titan? 

Joe: We heard a lot about to many roaming supers with Titans, and while that is the core fantasy they wanted to add other stuff. They are trying to make sure it works both as a pure one off, and as extended roaming.

Q: Crota armor is Age of Triumph? 

Joe: Yes. [going off on a tangent again] They are also trying some things with the contest mode. How hard a worlds first should be (in preparation for the TFS raid), the worlds first should be aspirational. [look, I'm not saying it's a ""oh you think Root of Nightmares is to easy, how do you like THIS"" response but... \^\^]

Also final thing: they are doing a charity drive and shirts for the wildfire victims in Hawaii. If you can either donate to them or a charity of your choice directly.

Final opinion: neat, but I think their desire to keep things wrapped to have a new experience is counterproductive after LF and the disappointment many felt, at least from a pure PR perspective. I do believe it's going to be good (simply because this was part of the OG plan, LF was not) but yeah. Not sure if there is a good solution if you want to both hype things up _and_ keep most under wraps for people to experience.

\- - - - - - - - - -

Harrison stirred from his much needed rest. Whatever dream he had was quickly forgotten as his foggy mind began to clear. He stretched his arms out wide, relieving the built up kinks in his muscles. A light breeze cooled his exposed skin; no blanket was present, nor was there any hard surface to comfort his sore back. He tried to recall what brought him to this uncomfortable bed.

He was observing the giant on the riverside. The beast terrified him. To the point of frantically running nearly ten kilometers to leave its presence, even. Yet, in his clouded state of mind, he thought it would be wise to approach it head on. More absurdly, the apex predator just stood there despite his threats. Only now did he realize that the arm movements were defensive in nature, if that. It really didn't fit the towering beast’s fearsome form; the pose was almost like an embarrassed schoolgirl caught changing.

But that was the extent of his knowledge. No matter how hard he jogged his memory, he could not remember what happened after the female voice spoke to him. There was certainly some missing information or events. When did he fall asleep? 

He finally opened his eyes, prompted to gauge the present situation. A strikingly beautiful sky met his observations, the starry night making its debut above. His endless struggle was grabbed by the sight—if even just for a moment. Small branches laden with leaves peppered the view, a blue moon peering through the canopy. Wisps of wandering clouds slipped through the atmosphere, both illuminated by the soft moonlight, and hiding the twinkle of the void beyond. Rustling accented the peaceful moment.

The entire forest around him danced in a light breeze. He would have been further entranced by the scene—somewhat reminding him of his younger years spent staring at the night sky—if it wasn’t for the deafening snores of the towering beast nearby, its torso pressed against a gray tree trunk. Four arms  folded across each other along its chest, while its chin was pressed down onto the top set of limbs. Its long legs had criss-crossed, a powerful tail lay between its powerful thighs.

It appeared to be asleep for now, so he glanced around the small forest clearing, looking for his equipment. A few moments of fruitless searching began to spark some anxiety. It wasn’t until he spared another look at the beast did he locate the backpack leaning on the same trunk it was using for comfort—the moonlight barely illuminating a yellow resin handle.

He would have to make his way around the sleeping giant to retrieve his inventory. The engineer resigned to getting on his feet first before forming his plan of action. 

After waiting for a response from the alien in response to his movement, he fought with his instincts to flee as he crawled slowly towards the beast. When there was no sign of wakefulness, he decided to give a wide berth to the giant and move forward. He would have to continue slowly and as quietly as possible.

Each step was agonizing; his thighs burned, and his back ached from holding the hunched position. Yet, he made it all the closer with each step. He could practically reach out and grab his bag, but it might make enough noise to awaken the giant in the process. He was close enough to hear the soft breathing from the giant at this point, the close proximity raising his heart rate and forcing out shaky breaths.

His hands quaked. It certainly wasn’t cold enough out here to cause tremors. 

Just a few more steps and he could leave, maybe enjoy a long shower in the barracks, or perhaps get a full night's rest—one that won't leave his back aching in the morning. Four anxiety-inducing steps later, he reached for the harness and gripped the chest straps with his hands, giving a cautious glance to the creature beside it. Thankfully, it simply cycled another breath, clearly in the deep clutches of sleep.

Slowly, he pulled up the straps and checked to see if all the equipment was still present. A passing glance confirmed the hatchet, knives, and bucket, yet no spear. He shot his head around in the moonlight, hoping to spot it to no avail. There was no time to worry about a piece of wood, he had to leave before he was caught again. He pulled the backpack up and away, just for something to fall right off the tree behind it.

Oh. There’s the spear.

With a loud *thwack*, the weapon fell right onto the slumbering alien. 

…Fuck.

A hiss of anger came from the giant. The beast slowly stood up to its towering form, reminiscent of the first time he saw the being.

*Fuck.*

Two glowing orange eyes locked onto his own, the gaze burning hot enough to bore holes through his skull. His feet were locked in place; none of his muscles would respond to his internal pleading. He needed to escape it, but the beast’s ire held tight onto his freeze instincts.

*“Star-sent?”* 

The same feminine voice trickled into his head. It only took a moment of staring at each other for its fiery pupils to temper their heat. The change in demeanor was all it took for him to regain control of his frozen legs.

He took the opportunity to scramble away as fast as he could. There was no time to check direction as his legs feverishly carried him through the red forest. The wet ground made each step difficult, tall brush hindered his line of sight. A thick canopy darkened the path before him—only allowing short breaks of moonlight between the trees.

Loud footsteps pounded the ground behind him, along with a shrill screech that sounded eerily similar to a mountain lion.

It was following him.

He nearly let out a scream of his own; an emerging fear of becoming imminent prey shaking him down to his core. His breathing grew more ragged as the minutes of sprinting blurred together. He wanted to stop to give his protesting legs a break, but footfalls still broke through the ambient forest noise around him. The giant’s clamorous breathing faded as he continued his mad dash

He was tempted to turn his head to observe more, but kept moving forward. The footfalls nearly slowed to a halt, and allowed his curiosity the edge over his survival instincts. For only a moment, he allowed himself a glance back towards the giant. Bright orange stared right back into his, distress nested within its ire. The giant was stumbling —barely making any headway, yet persevering towards its goal. Its large chest heaved under the stress all the while.

*“-must not leave, I cannot lose anymore-”*

He severed the eye contact to further focus on increasing the distance between them. The words she… yeah, it was a very feminine voice, it must be a she. The words she used were almost … desperate. It was startling how much emotion was packed into that brief glance. 

Emotion.

Was he empathizing with an actual night terror chasing him down? No. He just didn’t know what she wanted. There were more than enough opportunities for the giant to kill him—namely the times when he was unconscious on the bridge as well as near the river. What other reasons could there be to want to keep him alive? Was she perhaps going to bring him to her cave or something of the sort? He didn’t know, wasn’t sure if he wanted to.

The adrenaline was quickly wearing off, slowing his stride. He looked behind him once every few moments to make sure she had been left behind.

He heard nothing of her footfalls, nor anything else besides the ambient croaking of amphibians. Now would be the best time to collect himself under the cover of safety. Slowing to a walk, he grabbed his data pad and pulled up his destination: the barracks. Given his luck so far, he would’ve expected to find himself sprinting in the opposite direction. Nevertheless, it was closer than he expected; only a little over two kilometers remained. It wouldn’t be a long walk and there certainly was no time like the present to get such a job done.

He continued his trek at a walking pace for a few minutes, before the moist wetland gave way to a larger, more open field. A gentle slope upwards led across the meadow to its hilltop mansion. At least it was a mansion compared to what he had been subject to so far.

 atop the little bump in the field, the barracks lay upright in all its blocky glory. A short trail of debris behind it, the scorched earth impling a burning entry. The gray cube itself was no taller than a two story home, and as wide as a four lane street each way. No unique features stood out amongst the dull monotone building, but that was the goal of its engineering; most of its equipment and aspects were intended to fold into the walls. Hell, from what he learned in training, even the furniture neatly tucked away. It was a pretty damn sleek building, despite its lack of exterior decoration.

He noted the way stars shined off its metallic sheen while he made his way to the hilltop. All the while, he quickly checked the treeline for any hints of orange. When no giants made their presence known, he stopped to look up. For the second time that night, he appreciated the lack of light pollution. The night sky was alight with dazzling colors of the universe. Before now, only small moments on space stations allowed him to appreciate the majesty of the greater cosmos. In fact, he was lucky to be able to see much of the sky at all. Others stationed on mining moons were lucky to see the surface, let alone the night sky.

The treeline formed a wide circle around his destination. Most of it contained the same flexible rubbery trees and the sturdy brown alternative.

The far side, in contrast, had opened to the black gaping maw of the ocean. The bright moonlight reflected off smooth waves which crashed into a stout rock wall not too dissimilar to the one he woke up on earlier in the day.

He had quite the view of the vast forest, especially in the pale blue light afforded to him by the night. One sight did take his ire, however. Opposite the side of the beach, a short mountain scraped the sky with its sharp points. A bright inferno lay between the highest peaks. Its light stretched far across the mountains, marking its territory for all to see. Grand smoke stacks grew from the mountain peak, reaching far into the night sky.

The fire was held far above any forest, but the thought of a natural disaster horrified him. He would be helpless in a wildfire—or any natural disaster really. Were the flames caused by the atmospheric entry of a module or an anomaly? He spent a few more moments enjoying the grim beauty of the scene before him; tonight showed him there was a lot of beauty to be found on this planet—despite its otherworldly horrors.

He took the time to make that last couple meters to the entrance of the gray brick he had been searching for. An enlarged airlock that was intended to connect to the other modules took center stage. He pressed his hand to the panel beside the door to unlock it. 

Nothing moved. 

He waited a bit longer.

Finally, a sharp hiss emanated from the door—the atmosphere injected to the red planet. He entered the airlock, noticing there was nothing but the red emergency lighting. That never meant anything good. Despite a tinge of worry, he looked forward, waiting for the airlock to finish its cycle. 

The second door opened to a wide lobby. A large section to the left held a kitchen; a short island for eating and cooking rested between him and the other cooking equipment that lined the wall. Lights that looked better suited for industrial use sprouted in lines from the ceiling. Just like the airlock, the area was flush with an unsettling crimson glow that lined the floor of the walls.

There were also sections along the further wall that folded out into tables and benches. Some lay in a partly open state, most likely due to the rough landing. Metal debris and scattered kitchen equipment cluttered the ground. He resigned himself to clean it later, the engineer felt it much more important to figure out proper lighting first.

A short stairwell as well as an industrial elevator to its side laid in front of him; he had no idea why such equipment would be necessary, considering the barracks function. Either way, both led upstairs, which was home to the personal quarters, living room, a small medical room, and a large bathing section.

The stairs hugged a wall to the right. Every module held an industrial storage area pre-packed with equipment and resources. This one was no exception, along the same wall was a large sliding door that reached up to the ceiling. Besides food and clothing, he wasn’t really sure what the room held in terms of cargo. Once more, the task became an addition to the to-do list.

For now, he decided to take his harness off and make his way to a large interface near the kitchen island. Hopefully, there was something he could do about the lighting. This type of monitor was found nearly everywhere on every module; it held controls, diagnostics, and other information about its building. The screen flickered upon his arrival, briefly flashing the logo of its operating system. 

Micron computing. Now there’s a familiar name. They were known for the invention of quantum computing and its proliferation across the United Planets, though dabbled in many other ventures—even if it was through sister-companies or other.

Micron was also pretty big in the AI game, if he recalled. Maybe the computing system of the barracks had its own? The colony managers never mentioned many details of their equipment, only the basics. The leaders of the project expected all pioneers to be exceptionally well-versed in their craft; perhaps the technician would be able to share her knowledge of the technology here… When he made the hundred kilometer trek that is. He let out a heavy sigh he must have been holding in for a while.

The interface finally showed up after a few moments of booting up. He swiped through the diagnostics first. Most equipment was working optimally if not a little bumped up by the crash. Power cells were not charging, the kitchen’s wiring wasn’t connected, and the solar panels had taken a beating during the fall. 

He started off the to-do list by deploying the energy production features. A short hiss and a heavy *klunk* indicated the unfolding of the solar panels and the rising of the wind turbines. A long whine of running motors followed suit. Halfway through the deployment, a shriek of metal scratching the walls made him wince. 

Yeah, the solar cells might have taken some damage. Great.

The panel showed that about half of the panels were successfully deployed and all of the turbines on the roof were erected. Satisfied for now, he dove into the controls, diverting excess power to lighting. With a flick of a nearby switch, the kitchen lights illuminated the area, allowing much more visibility than the red hue that was produced before. 

A curious perusal of the settings, and he found his suspicions confirmed; an option for an AI companion was nestled deep within the settings.

It had a few options for its voice, personality, and what icon the user wanted to represent its presence. Younger him would have chosen a female partner type AI, but he felt the need for another archetype.

[Good evening sir,] a posh English voice resounded from the speakers within the kitchen. 

The engineer smiled from ear to ear. “Hello Sebas, what functions of the barracks module can you access?”

[I have access to all electronics within the module. This includes entertainment, lighting, sensors, generators, doors, direction systems, and charging stations.]

“Direction systems?” Harrison queried, leaving a hand combed within his hair.

[Direction systems implemented in each module assist with navigation and mapping between stations. Information is sent wirelessly between modules.]

“Open the interactive map.” He whipped his attention to the monitor.

A black map appeared, small blue icons popping up in sequence representing each module. Each lay at varying intervals, scattered amongst the sea of unknown black. Small circles of color surrounded each icon on the 2D map.

“Is there a legend?” A small section appeared in the monitor’s corner at his request, containing symbols followed by their descriptions. 

The colors looked to represent the many natural biomes of the land. The barracks lay amongst grasslands and a body of water, the bridge laid within swamplands alongside the agricultural center. Other modules landed within the red forest, and as he suspected, another had landed atop the far mountain. The mountain module and one other had no color around them at all, apparently too damaged to make use of sensors. The cargo bay rested in a body of water only a hundred meters or so away from the beach. The more gripping issue was its vast distance away from the rest.

He could figure out what each icon meant and what module it represented, but he was at a loss figuring out what a cruise ship icon conveyed. It was the only symbol without a proper entry in the legend. Curious, he tapped on it to find out any information that system may provide. 

External photos and information instantly filled the screen. No.That wasn’t possible. It couldn’t be. 

It was supposed to arrive five years later.

The High Spirits laid amongst the same planet he did; its decrepit form lay upon jagged rocks, red flora climbing the outer hull. Debris was scattered along a wide gash in the rocky terrain behind it. Cargo and furniture spilled out the side of a large cut in the port side; it appeared to have melted through the hull.

His head felt like it was going to implode, the pressure threatening to crush his skull. He hadn’t taken enough time to think about the future beyond imminent survival and escape. Upon seeing the deaths of the other crewmates, he figured that he would just have to survive until the colony ship arrived. 

They would certainly know what to do. They were the real professionals.

What was he supposed to do when his rescue had already failed?

“Sebas, what data can you get from the High Spirits?” he choked out, his voice quivering as it betrayed his poorly held up confidence.The information appeared on the screen along with the AI assistant’s voice. 

[Significant hull breach—presumably from a crash landing—along with radiation leakage from a hole within the reactor. Energy is stable, 573 cryo pods are operational, cargo bay is intact, and the captain is missing from her station.]

Harrison clenched his fist, forcing his jaw to loosen as the pressure grinded his teeth. He shut his eyes—his tone hopeful, yet defeated. “What happened to the rest of the cryo pods?” 

He waited in anticipation, worry seeping in. In the few moments of waiting, his mind began dragging up the myriad of horrible ways the people were lost.

[Unknown, sir.]

He sat in silence, pouring over the information some more while he calmed his breathing. He couldn’t keep his focus on it. He was just doing anything to not remind himself of his permanent residence on the red, god forsaken planet. 

Again, the filthy mixture of stress, hopelessness, and frustration welled behind his head. Just more and more kept being added to this shit situation. 

“FUCK.” Anguish poured out along his yell.

He had to stop himself from punching the monitor in front of him, his better judgment prevailing over the spilling emotions. He let out a shuttered breath between clenched teeth, allowing his frustrations to leak away from the boiling pot.

What was he to do now? No one was going to save him. No colony needed his expertise. He had no end goal. Nothing to work for

[Is everything alright sir?] a soft, yet reassuringly grounded voice asked.

No. Nothing is alright. He let out a chuckle, but it wouldn’t stop. In a few moments, he was full-on laughing. The engineer had a hard time catching his breath. 

It was absurd. Everything was. He couldn’t believe he let himself falter again—twice in the same day, even. It was pitiful to hear himself crumble at each blow.

“Everything is just peachy, Sebas, thank you for asking.” He wiped the last bits of morbid humor off his face. All the stress, turmoil, and events piled onto his sanity. Why would everything have to be alright? Life was about facing adversity. It was about overcoming each and every curveball thrown at you.

He was a greater man than one who was just waiting for the colonists to arrive. In fact, he was now unshackled. The world was his oyster, he was a miserable man for thinking the arrival of others would somehow let him escape this hell. No way would he let some primitive planet control him, and make him beg for the help of others. 

Everything he could ever want was on this planet. The ships brought all the machines, the planet offered all the materials, and he had all the knowledge. Hell, he could even have his own farm and live out the frontier fantasy he held so close to his heart since he was a child.

This was it, the adventure of a lifetime. No more monotonous work hours to drain his soul. No more shitty friends. No more would he be tied to any company. 

He would have to take this step by step; not everything was within reach just yet, but it was all possible. There was a long line of progression to complete his goal of self-sufficiency. First task on the to-do list? Take stock of the barracks.

It was very late, but he had already slept some hours prior. So, with his restful state in combination with his newfound goal, he was motivated to begin immediately. 

He began with the storage section. He walked up to the industrial door, tapping a pad to open it. One flick of the lightswitch, and the area was illuminated—large cubed crates lining the walls, stacked four high. They were stored in a formation that allowed a clear path between differing sections of storage. Some areas were dedicated to foodstuffs, others assigned to clothing, and the rest were marked for rooming or bathing.

He made his way to a crate within the food section, and with the help of a small step-ladder, he brought it to the floor. For its meter-long size, it sure didn’t weigh a lot—at least not as much as he was expecting. After a moment of fiddling with the panel atop it, he found the crate was unlocked.

Inside, there were insulating packets placed around the sides and in between the foodstuffs. He figured that the box itself would be a fine insulator—the packets being rather inefficient as they took up a large amount of space. Besides that, he found some hardy vegetables and a few packets of raw meat. Maybe he would be able to make a stew tonight.

An hour or so had passed as he checked a few crates and gathered all the resources he could. Clothing, bedding, cleaning supplies. The list went on. He made his way up the short staircase to the second floor, resources in tow. 

The upper floor was just as monotone and dreary as the outside, except for the light orange paint amongst the walls creating a wire-like design. It added something of a motif to the gray background. At least the interior had a concrete design rather than just cool metal. 

The living area sat to his right, meant for recreation and entertainment. It sat as a loft overseeing the staircase and part of the kitchen. A red cross indicated the medical room behind. A sizable television sat as the centerpiece along the far wall atop of a storage drawer. An orange couch sat opposite it, a table curiously missing between them. Upon further inspection, an outline on the floor indicated another folding table situation. Placing his hands within two gaps, he was able to pull up a coffee table with little effort—extra storage revealed during the process. With his curiosity piqued, he opened the metal sliding door and found an old gaming system along with a few physical disc cases. 

When did he last play a video game? When did he even have access to a game console? He remembered getting one for Christmas when he was ten; his father had a well-paying job and could afford to spend just a little bit extra. He appreciated it all the more and played it whenever he had the chance. 

That was until he was put into the engineering school—shipped away for a year at a time—where he had no access to it, and certainly no time for it in between studying and classes. His job was no better. He never really bothered with a console after that, as he had to move every few months.

He wanted to sit down and power it up for a bit. He did have free reign over his choices, but no. He should set himself up first, maybe later he could try the console when he had finished. 

The other side of the second floor held a short hallway with two doors—one leading to a communal bathroom, the other holding the sleeping arrangements. 

Entering the bedroom, he was greeted with eight bunks, four along each wall, with lockers in the center between each pair acting like makeshift partitions. Dressers sat between the ends of the beds. 

Each piece of furniture was either bolted down to the floor, or appeared to be able to fold into the walls—much like the rest of the barracks. Blank white mattresses rested on the beds, some electronics on the side controlled a heating or cooling function within. He never had the opportunity to stay at a nicer apartment with heated bedding, so this would be his chance to enjoy some of the luxuries.

He quickly laid out his items for bedding and chose the bed to his right, closest to the door. He folded up the top bunk to give himself more space to access his bed. It only took a few minutes, but he tidied things up and stored his items for later use. 

He took the time to inspect the bathroom on the floor. It was rather nicely decorated in contrast to the rest of the barracks. Well, everything was nicely decorated in comparison. The caustic stench of industrial cleaning solvent pierced his nose as he stepped inside. It was probably hosed down before being sent along with the other modules. It had tiled floors and walls—blue in color, but a gradient of white was added as the tiles reached for the ceiling. 

Four large bathroom stalls stood on the left wall, a line of six sinks lay on the right, and an entrance to the showers was found at the far end. He entered the secondary room picking out the shape of a large bath. Controls suggested the ability to adjust temperature and … no way. Jet controls. The bowl was a hot tub. It made him respect the colony project managers a bit more. They certainly looked out for their pioneers.

There were a few shower stations further along the wall, and a drying station for post-shower use. He gazed into the mirror on his right, the eyes of a nearly unrecognizable figure staring back at him. 

It wasn’t like he grew a beard yet, but he was covered in dirt and stray forest debris. His hair looked more like a bird’s nest than the tamed mane he was used to. Even worse, he could see pit stains that bled through his black shirt in the sterile light. 

He really needed a shower.

After settling in a few more items in the bunkroom, he made his way to address the new issue. Starting the tap, he found the water cold. Waiting a few more minutes changed nothing. Still cold. 

“Sebas, is the water heater online?”

[No, sir, it is offline until energy can be recuperated in tomorrow's light.]

“Damn.”

He couldn’t say the shower was relaxing—his pale, shivering skin exemplifying why—but it felt nice to be clean. It certainly did no favors for the large scab formed upon his left arm. He donned a new pair of clothes that were the same as his previous set: cargo shorts and another black t-shirt. 

He was going to see what he could do with the food at hand, but an alarm drew his conscious thought to the nearby monitor. 

[Unknown bipedal lifeform at south entrance.] 

A camera view of the airlock appeared, showing the orange-armored beast looking around curiously. A tinge of fear spiked at his chest, but was soon replaced by stalwart confidence. 

He furrowed his brow, “Sebas, lock and secure the door please, let no wildlife in.” 

He left the monitor with a sneer.

This was his castle, not hers.

dopsicle,,,,1692884571,,,1602bz7,,,,,,t3_1602bz7,1,,/r/conspiracy/comments/1602bz7/natural_events_in_turkey_and_hawaii/,,,,"Following the whistleblower incident from Raytheon had me thinking back to the start of the year, when Turkey had a disastrous earthquake right as Finland and Sweden's applications to NATO were headline news. Turkey was standing in the way, playing tough to get some brand spanking new jets.

**\*earthquakes hit, causing mass death and chaos internally\***

Important to also note that days before the quakes hit, ambassadors and embassies of major players in the West are evacuated on the basis of ""Quran burnings"" and ""safety"" ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/3/turkey-says-western-nations-gave-no-evidence-of-security-risks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/3/turkey-says-western-nations-gave-no-evidence-of-security-risks)).

Financial and humanitarian assistance is given to Turkey from all over. The dust settles, and by the end of March NATO gets a new ally on the Russian border (Finland). 

Now, what makes my socks spin here is the recent Whistleblower incident from Raytheons Eric Hecker ([https://www.tiktok.com/@red\_pill\_taken/video/7245780732029816090](https://www.tiktok.com/@red_pill_taken/video/7245780732029816090)).

Earthquake weapons you say? Hmm.. 

The timing of mass chaos, during starting electoral campaigns in Turkey, and the signing of new NATO members, who Turkey very boldly refusing entry, hmmmm...

Connected? Idk man im just folding up some tin over here.

Extra xtra special lil theory: 

Maui wildfires also resulted from said weapon. Video from beginning of the year: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn\_PMiND4Yw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn_PMiND4Yw)

Compare laser above \^\^ to the first hand account from Eric Hecker behind the first video linked, at 03:12.

There won't be any forecasters or sirens or text alerts. We will be on our own.

Sure, I might have a plan for what I'd do if a wildfire was coming my way. But how would I know? Same for a dangerously high heat event (like reaching a deadly wet bulb temperature). Even if you have a way of measuring the temperature outside, you wouldn't know how long it would last. Same concern about hurricanes. And flash floods. And tornadoes. Etc.

Maybe you've all already realized this, but it is keeping me up at night.",,,preppers,No warnings or forecasts after the collapse,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/16027k1/no_warnings_or_forecasts_after_the_collapse/

Of the many fires, the fronts in the north and near Athens, where blazes had reached Parnitha National Park, were considered the most dangerous.
On Tuesday, the bodies of 18 people, among them two children, were discovered in a forest in the Evros region near the border with Turkey. 

In the northern port city of Alexandroupolis, ash rained on empty waterfront tavernas and the thick pall of smoke made breathing hard. Farther inland, past smoldering swaths of forest, locals in villages and farmsteads battled flames with sticks and buckets of water as firefighters deployed water-scooping helicopters and aircraft droned overhead.

Greece regularly battles major wildfires that become deadly. Its hot, dry, windy summers combined with native pine forests and combustible undergrowth create a perfect environment for blazes to grow out of control.

But fire-season preparedness measures, like digging up firebreaks and clearing out dry grasses, are still lacking, and environmental groups say the government has mishandled the fires and underinvested in firefighting equipment and training.

It was the second time this summer that the country’s firefighting forces were torn among multiple fronts. In July, thousands of tourists were evacuated from Rhodes and Corfu, popular resorts that largely depend on seasonal visitors.",,,Koina,Greece Battles Its Most Widespread Wildfires on Record • Extreme heat has turned much of the country into a tinderbox.

We are planning on going to Palio (next to Kavala) this Saturday and we’ve been following the wildfires in the last couple of days. They have since spread to the East Macedonia and Thrace regions (Avramilia), which is worryingly close to Kavala. Some of us are travelling from Sofia, Bulgaria and are planning to go through the Promachonas border control point and then go along EO63, EO12 and lastly EO2. What worries us more though is the other group traveling from Varna, Bulgaria (which is more to the east and thus closer to the wildfires). They have to cross the border through the Nymphaia control point and then take the A23 and E90 to the west, which according to google maps goes directly through the Avramilia wildfire.

So we have a couple of questions:

1. Are there any road closures along those routes that you know of and what are some reliable sources (preferably in english) which can help us gain more information on that topic. We’re not sure how reliable and up-to-date the info on Google maps is. Are there perhaps any other routes we should consider?

2. And for those currently in or near Kavala, how safe would you say it is? With that I mean air quality and wildfires spreading further west.

We are well aware that people are suffering and many have lost their homes, so our concerns are insignificant, really.
We just wanted to gain some insight on the situation, so we could decide if it’s best to cancel the trip.",,,GreeceTravel,Traveling to Kavala,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/16009mh/traveling_to_kavala/

My cats have taken up the fun habit of rampaging through my room at 3 o’clock in the morning, every night for the past 6 days. My female, who is the main troublemaker, instigates and then her and my main coon boy play fight making as much noise as possible, thumping around on the floor, attacking the bedposts, scratching the door, knocking their water bowls over (purposely), going crazy on the litter box, etc. 

I live in a big house with my parents and grandparents, and I keep my cats in my room with me at night mostly for safety issues. We live in a very wildfire prone area and I prefer to have them in my room at night in case we need to leave quickly and I can easily put them in their carriers. That said I have resorted to locking them out of my room so I may be able to get some sleep but I feel badly about that because they’re food and litter box are in here (I know I need another litter box for them, currently arguing with my parents about where they would deem it acceptable in the house). 

I guess I could play with them a little more during the day to try to get them stimulated, but it’s not like they have nothing to do all day. This is a farm house so when they’re not sleeping they’re hunting for mice and insects all over the house. 

I’m at a loss. Cat people: any suggestions on how I can get through the night again without the feline rampage? Thanks :)

edit: I am not locking them out of my room all night, just starting at 3am when I get woken up and throw them out because they’ve been going at it for a half an hour and can’t take it anymore",,,PetAdvice,3am plea for help,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetAdvice/comments/15zycmi/3am_plea_for_help/

TL;DR: Facing an unjust 5x rent increase while a rent dispute is in court. The landlord is spreading false eviction rumors, causing us to lose clients and hurting our business. Seeking advice on how to counteract these actions and keep our fitness center running. Any suggestions or shared experiences are greatly appreciated. Thank you, Reddit!

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm in a really tough spot right now and could really use some advice from those who've been through something similar or have expertise in handling such situations. I've been running a fitness center for the past two decades, and things have been going quite well, until now.

Here's the deal: During our recent rent renewal, the landlord hit us with an outrageous 5x increase in our rent. Unbelievable, right? We couldn't afford that sudden spike, so we decided to take the matter to the local court to mediate and determine a fair rent for us. While the legal process is ongoing, the landlord seems to be doing everything in their power to drive us out of business.

They've gone as far as putting up a notice right in front of our gym, spreading the word that we've been terminated and are on the brink of eviction. This has had a devastating effect on our business. Prospective clients who come to check out the gym are being turned away, and even our existing members are hesitating to renew their memberships due to the uncertainty surrounding our future.

What's worse is that our competitors are capitalizing on this situation. They've jumped on the bandwagon, advertising that we're on the verge of closing down and warning people not to join our gym. This false narrative is spreading like wildfire and it's seriously impacting our ability to generate income.

Honestly, we're in a bind right now and struggling to make ends meet, let alone cover the inflated rent. I'm turning to you, Reddit fam, to seek advice on how to navigate this incredibly unfair situation. Have any of you been through something similar? What steps did you take to counteract these tactics and keep your business afloat?

We're open to any suggestions, whether they involve legal action, PR strategies, or creative ideas to reassure our clients and potential customers that we're still very much in business and fighting to provide our services. Any advice will help! We're all ears!",,,Advice,Urgent Advice Needed: Dealing with Unfair Business Practices Amid Rent Dispute,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/15zw3sv/urgent_advice_needed_dealing_with_unfair_business/

Kamakailan, isang malaking wildfire ang naganap sa Hawaiian Island sa United States, na nagdulot ng malaking pinsala sa ekolohiya at pagkalugi sa ekonomiya. Ayon sa mga opisyal ng U.S., ang wildfire ay isang natural na sakuna dulot ng tagtuyot at malakas na hangin. Gayunpaman, kahapon lamang, ang British MI6 (MI6) ay biglang naglabas ng isang pahayag, na inilalantad ang kamangha-manghang katotohanan sa likod ng napakalaking apoy!

Ayon sa MI6, hindi natural na nangyari ang wildfire na ito, ngunit gawa ng tao ng gobyerno ng US! Lumalabas na ang militar ng U.S. ay lihim na gumagawa ng bagong uri ng armas na tinatawag na ""weather weapon"", na maaaring magdulot ng iba't ibang natural na sakuna sa pamamagitan ng pagmamanipula ng lagay ng panahon. At ang Hawaiian wildfire na ito ay isa lamang ""weather weapon"" na eksperimento sa pag-atake na isinasagawa ng militar ng US!

Sinabi ng MI6 na nakuha nila ang impormasyon sa pamamagitan ng isang depektong senior US military scientist. Ang siyentipikong ito ay lumahok sa pananaliksik at pagpapaunlad at pag-eeksperimento ng ""mga sandata ng panahon"" at may mahusay na pag-unawa sa mga prinsipyo at epekto nito. Dahil sa kanyang hindi mapakali na konsensya, nagpasya siyang i-leak ang inside story sa MI6 at nagbigay ng kaugnay na ebidensya at impormasyon.

Sinabi ng MI6 na na-verify at nasuri nila ang mga ebidensya at materyales na ito, at naniniwala na mayroon silang mataas na antas ng kredibilidad at pagiging tunay.

Naniniwala sila na ang pag-uugaling ito ng gobyerno ng U.S. ay lubhang mapanganib at imoral, hindi lamang nagdudulot ng malubhang pinsala sa buhay at ari-arian sa Isla ng Hawaii, ngunit nagdudulot din ng malaking banta sa pandaigdigang kapayapaan at seguridad.

Nanawagan ang MI6 sa internasyunal na komunidad na bigyang-pansin at kondenahin ang bagay na ito, at hiniling na agad na itigil ng gobyerno ng US ang pagsasaliksik at pagpapaunlad at pag-eeksperimento ng ""mga sandata ng panahon"", at ibunyag ang katotohanan at mga kahihinatnan nito sa mundo.

Kasabay nito, ipinahayag din ng British MI6 na patuloy nilang susubaybayan at ilalantad ang anumang hindi wastong pag-uugali ng gobyerno ng US, at makipagtulungan sa ibang mga bansa upang sama-samang mapanatili ang pandaigdigang kapayapaan at katatagan.

Ang paghahayag na ito ng MI6 ay nagdulot ng sensasyon at pagkabigla sa buong mundo. Lalo na sa United States, matapos lumabas ang balita, nagkagulo at nataranta ang buong bansa.

Maraming tao ang nagagalit at hindi nasisiyahan sa ginawa ng gobyerno ng US, at humihingi ng makatwirang paliwanag. Nanatiling tahimik ang gobyerno ng U.S. sa usapin at hindi gumawa ng anumang tugon.

Kaya, ano nga ba ang ""weather weapon""? Gaano ito kalakas at kakila-kilabot? Maikli nating ipakilala ito.

Ang ""Weather weapon"" ay isang bagong uri ng armas na gumagamit ng siyentipiko at teknolohikal na paraan upang manipulahin ang kapangyarihan ng kalikasan at atakehin ang kaaway. Maaari itong mag-trigger ng mga natural na sakuna tulad ng baha, tagtuyot, bagyo, lindol, at pagsabog ng bulkan sa pamamagitan ng pagsasaayos ng lagay ng panahon, na nagdudulot ng mapangwasak na mga dagok sa mga pasilidad ng militar ng kaaway, imprastraktura ng ekonomiya, at buhay ng mga tao.

Iniulat na ang militar ng US ay namuhunan ng higit sa sampung taon at malaking halaga ng pera sa pananaliksik at pagpapaunlad ng ""mga sandata ng panahon"". Ang kanilang mga layunin ay higit sa lahat laban sa Russia at sa malalaking bansa sa silangan, gayundin sa ilang mga anti-American na bansa sa Gitnang Silangan. Kapag ang ""weather weapon"" ay matagumpay na nabuo, gagamitin ito ng militar ng U.S. para magsagawa ng mga pag-atake at makamit ang mga hegemonic na ambisyon nito.

At ang Hawaiian wildfire na ito ay isang eksperimento sa pag-atake ng ""weather weapon"" na isinagawa ng militar ng US. Napili ang Hawaii bilang pang-eksperimentong lokasyon dahil plano ng militar ng U.S. na hilingin ang lupain doon upang palawakin ang base militar nito.

Higit pa rito, sa pamamagitan ng eksperimentong ito, maaaring maunawaan ng militar ng US ang iba't ibang data sa unang pagkakataon upang mapabuti at maperpekto ang ""weather weapon"".

Ang balita ay nagulat at natakot sa mga pamahalaan at mga tao sa buong mundo. Nag-aalala ang lahat kung gagamit muli ng ""weather weapons"" ang gobyerno ng US sa pag-atake sa ibang mga bansa. Kung nangyari ang ganoong bagay, ang mga kahihinatnan ay magiging mapaminsala. Ang pandaigdigang kapaligirang ekolohikal, pag-unlad ng ekonomiya at sibilisasyon ng tao ay magdaranas ng matinding pagkalugi.

Samakatuwid, dapat nating bigyan ng malaking kahalagahan at pagbabantay ang bagay na ito. Hindi natin maaaring balewalain ang potensyal na banta ng gobyerno ng US, at hindi rin tayo maaaring umupo at panoorin itong kumilos nang walang ingat.

Dapat nating palakasin ang internasyonal na kooperasyon, sama-samang bumalangkas ng mga pamantayan at regulasyon, at ipagbawal ang anumang bansa sa pagbuo at paggamit ng ""mga sandata ng panahon"". Dapat din nating palakasin ang pangangasiwa at paggabay sa pag-unlad ng agham at teknolohiya, upang ang teknolohiya ay makapagdulot ng pakinabang sa sangkatauhan sa halip na mga sakuna.

Sa madaling salita, ang paghahayag na ito ng MI6 ay nakapukaw ng pandaigdigang atensyon at mga babala. Bagama't hindi pa kumpirmado ang pagiging tunay ng mga balita, ipinapaalala nito sa atin na dapat nating palakasin ang ating mga depensa laban sa mga bagong armas at pag-unlad ng teknolohiya.

Hindi natin maaaring balewalain ang potensyal na pinsala ng teknolohiya dahil sa pag-unlad nito, ngunit dapat panatilihin ang pandaigdigang kapayapaan at seguridad sa pamamagitan ng internasyonal na pakikipagtulungan at mga pamantayan.

Umaasa kami na ang insidenteng ito ay maakit ang atensyon ng mga pamahalaan at ng internasyonal na komunidad, palakasin ang koleksyon ng paniktik at pag-iingat sa seguridad, at matiyak ang kaligtasan ng ating bansa at mga tao.

Kasabay nito, inaasahan din na ang pag-unlad ng agham at teknolohiya ay maaaring magdulot ng higit na benepisyo sa sangkatauhan, sa halip na abusuhin o gawing kasangkapan ng digmaan.

Sa pamamagitan lamang ng pandaigdigang magkasanib na pagsisikap maaari nating mapanatili ang kapayapaan at katatagan at lumikha ng isang mas ligtas at mas mahusay na mundo. Magkapit-bisig tayo para protektahan ang planetang ito at sama-samang lumikha ng magandang kinabukasan.#weatherweapon",,,u_AffectionateCup6934,"Pagputok!

Step boldly into the fray, and let your hands and spirit embrace the trials that await. Unravel mysteries, forge alliances, confront treachery, and embrace the power within.  
  
A note about the campaign itself. The game has been going on for about 2 years now. The bonds forged between the current 3 players are strong but we are all very nice people and openly welcome new players! <3 Some things that have occurred to keep in mind notes wise(These notes are courtesy of our faithful note taking centaur!  
  
Frejlord: In the icy realm of Frejlord, a chilling tale unfolds, filled with treachery, mystery, and the clash of titanic forces. It all began with a sinister plot involving the enigmatic alchemist, Singed, who unleashed a plague of undead horrors upon the unsuspecting town, only to be revealed as an unintended consequence of a zombie infestation lurking in the shadows of the sewers. The blame was wrongly cast upon Singed, forcing him to embark on a quest for a cure, which eventually granted him deliverance from the vile virus.  
  
Meanwhile, amidst the turmoil, a great war erupted between the formidable leaders of Frejlord: Lissandra, Ashe, and Sejuani. In a fateful twist of fate, your intrepid band chose to ally with the noble and courageous Ashe, fighting bravely on the front lines and ultimately emerging victorious, bringing an end to the bloody conflict.  
  
Yet, there was a deeper and darker force at play. Enter the Boogeyman, known as Babayaga or Solomon, an arch-lich who had once challenged the very gods themselves during the epoch of the great war. This malevolent entity had ensnared Lissandra, tainting her heart and twisting her into a maleficent puppet. As your group crossed paths with this ancient and immensely potent being, it was evident that he had awakened from his slumber, wielding unimaginable power even in his nascent state.  
  
Amidst these trials and tribulations, your party's heartwarming journey took a tender turn. Moved by compassion and benevolence, they chose to embrace orphans and carve a new beginning through the establishment of an orphanage. It was a testament to their pure spirits, and the druid among you emphasized the need for new companions to appreciate and cherish the company of the little ones.  
  
Zaun/Piltover: In the vibrant and bustling cities of Zaun and Piltover, their journey took a compelling turn, leading them to the heart of two metropolises intertwined by ingenuity and mystery.  
  
As the lingering marks of the past's poison stirred, they ventured to Zaun in search of a cure. Within the confines of this alchemical marvel, they found respite and healing, the poisons purged from their body by the expertise of Zaunite healers.  
  
Fortune favored them further when a gracious invitation brought them to a grand hospital in Piltover, a marvel of architectural brilliance. However, this visit took an unexpected twist when an unfortunate soul was ruthlessly assassinated within the very walls of the esteemed establishment. The eerie echoes of a murder mystery beckoned you to uncover the truth.  
  
Upon delving deeper, the intrepid group uncovered a shocking revelation—the targets of these murders were none other than corrupt heads of research within the hospital. Their malevolence threatened the very foundation of this prestigious institution.  
  
But the plot thickened, and the web of intrigue extended beyond the confines of the hospital. It was revealed that the ""savior,"" a friend of the corrupt researchers, had become ensnared by the sinister machinations of Solomon. This once benevolent soul had succumbed to corruption, even slaying his own family under the dark influence.  
  
In a somber yet necessary act, the group put an end to his suffering and freed him from the grip of darkness, sparing him from further torment.  
  
Yet, the true enigma lay with the enigmatic figure of Solomon. Their investigations unveiled that his nefarious plans extended to Ionia, where the world tree stood, its fate in jeopardy. A powerful force such as Solomon could tip the delicate balance of Ionia, and the very heart of nature itself was at risk.  
  
Ionia: In a breathtaking twist of fate, the revelation of the world tree's impending demise struck like thunder, casting a shadow of despair over their journey. The urgency of the situation demanded swift action, and the adventurers set forth on a quest to seek a cure, hoping to save the very heart of Ionia.  
  
Amidst this perilous endeavor, tragedy struck close to home when the father of one of the players was brutally assassinated. The heartache of loss intensified the stakes, strengthening the resolve to unmask the culprits behind this heinous act.  
  
As your group pursued justice, the tendrils of the sinister cultists of Solomon began to emerge. Their dark influence stretched across lands and realities, threatening to plunge the world into chaos.  
  
With valor and cunning, the group thwarted the cultists' sinister machinations, putting an end to their malevolent plot. But the greatest revelation awaited—the cure for the dying world tree, the essence of life itself, was within your grasp.  
  
As the adventurers unlocked the secrets to saving the world tree, an unexpected miracle unfolded. The cure not only revitalized the ancient tree but the tree also brought back the father of the grieving companion. A reunion filled with tears of joy, an awe-inspiring testament to the power of hope and perseverance.  
  
Yet, amidst this miraculous triumph, the specter of Solomon loomed once more. The enigmatic adversary revealed himself anew, slipping away through a mysterious portal that led to Bilgewater—a city steeped in its own legends and tales of daring pirates and dark secrets.  
  
Bilgewater: The land the group currently resides! In this land of turmoil and opportunity, the four formidable contenders—Miss Fortune, Gangplank, Twisted Fate, and Graves—vie for dominance, each seeking to claim the ancient artifacts of old. Legends speak of twelve sacred relics that, when united, possess the power to grant any wish, a force that can reshape reality itself.  
  
Among the contenders, Gangplank stands tall with a newfound advantage—a sinister alliance with the enigmatic Solomon. The dark and powerful being provides Gangplank with an edge, one that makes his bid for the artifacts all the more formidable.  
  
In this crucible of power, alliances are fleeting, and treachery is ever-present. The stakes are immeasurable, for the consequences of the victor's wish could reshape not only Bilgewater but the entire realm of Runeterra.  
  
\-While the group has had plenty of other shenanigans, these are the main plot points that have occurred so far, if you are invited to the group you are more than welcome to pick their brains for all that has occurred!  
  
While you may have your character be from any of the lands, keep in mind that the main arcs for Frejlord, Zaun/Piltover, and Ionia have already concluded and resolved so while the party may go back to these lands for various reasons, your backstory may be in the backburner for awhile if you are from these lands.  
  
About the Group:  
  
\-There is no age requirement but I do recommend being 18 and up or at least having the maturity of being able to handle mature themes such as abuse, slavery, sexual acts, debauchery, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution  
  
\-Currently we have 3 players! All players are level 10! A tiefling circle of wildfire druid, an artificer human tinkerer, and a centaur fey wanderer ranger.  
  
\-This is a big journey. I'll understand if you drop out if you aren't interested but if you are...Be aware this adventure could take years to finish. It's once a week 5 hours for a couple years. Think about it. It's an investment.  
  
\-Time is a difficult issue for most people. I myself work full time and am only able to meet one day a week for a 5 hour session! Please be aware and be able to meet this time before applying! The time in question is 10 AM-3 PM PST time every Tuesday. Obviously I understand life gets in the way at times but please be able to meet this time consistently if you plan to join our adventure!  
  
\- The adventure will be filled with fighting, roleplay, exploration, free roaming, storytelling, a little railroading when necessary, but of course fun! I'd say 60-40, story/roleplaying and combat.  
  
General Rules For My Campaign:  
  
\- LGBTQ+ friendly  
  
\- Avrae bot, Roll20, and Discord will be the platform base but I'm okay with you using your own dice as long as you're honest with your rolls. I usually DM with my own dice but Avrae is really nifty if you don't have your own dice  
  
\-We started at Level 3 and are now level 10!  
  
\- Standard Array, Point Buy, or you can roll for your stats!  
  
\-Must be willing to disconnect the player from the person, don't bring unnecessary drama into the group (Don't take things personally)  
  
\-Must be willing to allow others to shine. (Play nice with one another)  
  
\-Must be willing to work with the group and not be destructive for no reason. ( No murder Hobo )  
  
\-Must be willing to accept consequences for actions in-game and death of characters.  
  
\-Must be willing to attend games regularly and on time.  
  
\-There may be some flirting or mature themes but no pure NSFW content, the most things will get to is fade to black  
  
\-You may multiclass but please approve any homebrew content with me first such as classes, race, or items  
  
\-Previous knowledge of League of Legends is not mandatory but if this campaign interests you than I recommend either learning or having some base knowledge but no meta gaming. You can get excited when you see a champion you like but don't put your assumptions of what you know into the campaign...it doesn't end well  
  
\-Roleplay is extremely important in my opinion. Become your character, make decisions based on what they'd do from their experiences and past, build them, make a voice, play AS THEM. I don't really do alignments but if it impacts how you play then go for it. Just don't be a murderhobo who says ""IT'S WHAT MY CHARACTER WOULD DO.""  
  
\-You don't need a webcam to play or join but you do need a mic and I recommend having a webcam as it helps me see when people are disinterested or want to move on with a plot.  
  
\-We do not use encumbrance (Ew coin weight? I don't want to count that) But that doesn't mean you can pick up a rock every 3 seconds just to have on your person and sell later. I will find a puddle that is deep enough for you to drown in, don't tempt me.  
  
\-Rewards. We like loot. Loot is good. We like the feeling of accomplishment from killing a big bad evil guy and getting a bunch of gold, but standard DnD uses loot in a way of throwing away or selling old weapons and getting new ones. I do something completely different. In the beginning of the game within 5 or 6 sessions you will find yourself a weapon. A unique custom designed weapon I have made for you that will grow with you as your character becomes stronger. You will get other loot sure that you will use on your travels and use in unique situations but this weapon will be bound with you forever and be your best friend.  
  
\-Speaking of gold. Tony, how do we get rewarded for our adventures if we get custom made weapons that grow with us? I'm GLAD YOU ASKED. I think DnD can be too easy at times. Gold, gold, gold everywhere and you just find magic items in chests sometimes. Sure sometimes those chests are mimics but still. Well. It is not quite that easy my friend. Everything is sellable and everything is expensive. You'll find loot sure. Maybe some gems, some dragon bones, you'll get the hide off a deer, some parchment of tales of a famous artifact, some fragments of a broken weapon. But earning money takes time and when you finally do have (If you read this far then congrats! Message me secret word: Higgledebum to earn bonus points/chance to get in!) enough to spend on that doohickey, staff, flame cloak, magic headband, returning dagger, poison pouch, or magic tattoo you've been eyeing for 7 sessions....It'll be all the more rewarding. I think oversaturation is a big problem in DnD. It should take time and be ever more rewarding when you get cool new stuff. It isn't just handed to you. You gotta earn that shit with blood, sweat, and tears.  
  
\-Realism is a big part of DnD but it's only as real as you make it. Your characters need to eat, sleep, and heal but I'm not going to keep track of every daily expense and force you to pay it every time  
  
\-I am a huge sucker for backstory. I love it. If you join please be prepared to write a unique backstory that I can include in the campaign. This isn't college there are no minimum or maximum requirements but give me more to work with and the more I can add to the campaign! Maybe your mother was murdered and you need to track down her killer? (Hey if you've read this far then kudos! Here's the second secret word! Potatoskins! Don't worry it's the last one) Maybe you got dissed that one time while playing on the streets for coin and you want to find him and prove you're an amazing bard? Maybe some guy robbed you and you want to track him down and torture him? Make it interesting make it unique!  
  
Note\*:If this post is still up and not closed it means I have not made any decisions yet and am still taking/looking at applications! <3 please do be patient with me as I am taking my time and looking at all applications and thinking a lot before making any decisions! I will respond to all applications whether or not you get in however!

Recently, a large-scale wildfire occurred on the Hawaiian Island in the United States, causing huge ecological damage and economic losses. According to U.S. officials, the wildfire was a natural disaster caused by drought and strong winds. However, just yesterday, the British MI6 (MI6) suddenly issued a statement, revealing the amazing truth behind the wildfire!

https://preview.redd.it/somumadie0kb1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=6722c59d15ac450eb01ce095e666162c3b56d9a7

According to MI6, this wildfire did not happen naturally, but was man-made by the US government! It turns out that the U.S. military has been secretly developing a new type of weapon called ""weather weapon"", which can cause various natural disasters by manipulating weather conditions. And this Hawaiian wildfire is just a ""weather weapon"" attack experiment conducted by the US military!

https://preview.redd.it/759swadie0kb1.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d6b4ecbc8d4ce50309560a44ea58171cb3e3dac

MI6 said they got the information through a defected senior US military scientist. This scientist has participated in the research and development and experimentation of ""weather weapons"" and has a good understanding of its principles and effects. Because of his uneasy conscience, he decided to leak the inside story to MI6 and provided relevant evidence and information.

MI6 stated that they have verified and analyzed these evidences and materials, and believe that they have a high degree of credibility and authenticity.

https://preview.redd.it/gkfetheie0kb1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1cb03bd1c2484a6f238207b4a4090433d227de2

They believe that this behavior of the U.S. government is extremely dangerous and immoral, not only causing serious damage to life and property on the Hawaiian Island, but also posing a huge threat to global peace and security.

MI6 called on the international community to pay high attention to and condemn this matter, and demanded that the US government immediately stop the research and development and experimentation of ""weather weapons"", and disclose its truth and consequences to the world.

https://preview.redd.it/40mkkjeie0kb1.png?width=317&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a90330918f69d6741e935dd0e966dd1ab3dc246

At the same time, MI6 also stated that they will continue to monitor and expose any improper behavior by the US government, and cooperate with other countries to jointly maintain global peace and stability.

This revelation by MI6 caused a sensation and shock all over the world. Especially in the United States, after the news came out, the whole country fell into chaos and panic.

Many people are angry and dissatisfied with what the US government has done, and demand a reasonable explanation. The U.S. government remained silent on the matter and did not make any response.

So, what exactly is a ""weather weapon""? How powerful and terrifying is it? Let's briefly introduce it.

""Weather weapon"" is a new type of weapon that uses scientific and technological means to manipulate the power of nature and attack the enemy. It can trigger natural disasters such as floods, droughts, storms, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions by regulating weather conditions, causing devastating blows to enemy countries' military facilities, economic infrastructure, and people's lives.

It is reported that the U.S. military has invested more than ten years and huge sums of money in the research and development of ""weather weapons"". Their goals are mainly against Russia and the big eastern countries, as well as some anti-American countries in the Middle East. Once the ""weather weapon"" is successfully developed, the U.S. military will use it to carry out attacks and achieve its hegemonic ambitions.

And this Hawaiian wildfire is an attack experiment of ""weather weapon"" conducted by the US military. Hawaii was chosen as the experimental location because the U.S. military plans to requisition land there to expand its military base.

Moreover, through this experiment, the U.S. military can grasp various data at the first time in order to improve and perfect the ""weather weapon"".

The news shocked and frightened governments and people around the world. Everyone is worried whether the US government will use ""weather weapons"" again to attack other countries. If such a thing did happen, the consequences would be disastrous. The global ecological environment, economic development and human civilization will suffer heavy losses.

Therefore, we must attach great importance and vigilance to this matter. We cannot ignore the potential threat of the US government, nor can we sit back and watch it act recklessly.

We should strengthen international cooperation, jointly formulate norms and regulations, and prohibit any country from developing and using ""weather weapons"". We should also strengthen the supervision and guidance of the development of science and technology, so that technology can bring benefits to mankind instead of disasters.

Burst! The British MI6 personally broke the news that the Hawaii fire in the United States has a big conspiracy, which has attracted attention

starter2023-08-14 18:53·Kai Kai!

Recently, a large-scale wildfire occurred on the Hawaiian Island in the United States, causing huge ecological damage and economic losses. According to U.S. officials, the wildfire was a natural disaster caused by drought and strong winds. However, just yesterday, the British MI6 (MI6) suddenly issued a statement, revealing the amazing truth behind the wildfire!

According to MI6, this wildfire did not happen naturally, but was man-made by the US government! It turns out that the U.S. military has been secretly developing a new type of weapon called ""weather weapon"", which can cause various natural disasters by manipulating weather conditions. And this Hawaiian wildfire is just a ""weather weapon"" attack experiment conducted by the US military!

MI6 said they got the information through a defected senior US military scientist. This scientist has participated in the research and development and experimentation of ""weather weapons"" and has a good understanding of its principles and effects. Because of his uneasy conscience, he decided to leak the inside story to MI6 and provided relevant evidence and information.

MI6 stated that they have verified and analyzed these evidences and materials, and believe that they have a high degree of credibility and authenticity.

They believe that this behavior of the U.S. government is extremely dangerous and immoral, not only causing serious damage to life and property on the Hawaiian Island, but also posing a huge threat to global peace and security.

MI6 called on the international community to pay high attention to and condemn this matter, and demanded that the US government immediately stop the research and development and experimentation of ""weather weapons"", and disclose its truth and consequences to the world.

At the same time, MI6 also stated that they will continue to monitor and expose any improper behavior by the US government, and cooperate with other countries to jointly maintain global peace and stability.

This revelation by MI6 caused a sensation and shock all over the world. Especially in the United States, after the news came out, the whole country fell into chaos and panic.

Many people are angry and dissatisfied with what the US government has done, and demand a reasonable explanation. The U.S. government remained silent on the matter and did not make any response.

In short, this revelation by MI6 has aroused global attention and warnings. Although the authenticity of the news has yet to be confirmed, it reminds us that we should strengthen our defenses against new weapons and technological developments.

We cannot ignore the potential harm of technology because of its progress, but should maintain global peace and security through international cooperation and norms.

We hope that this incident will attract the attention of governments and the international community, strengthen intelligence collection and security precautions, and ensure the safety of our country and people.

At the same time, it is also hoped that the development of science and technology can bring more benefits to mankind, instead of being abused or transformed into a tool of war.

Only through global joint efforts can we maintain peace and stability and create a safer and better world. Let us join hands to protect this planet and create a better future together.#weatherweapon",,,u_Fearless_Tea_6120,"Burst!

During the creation of the universe, Dorlys brought forth six archangels to administer the realm and serve as messengers. Tim, the archangel of luck; Salto, the archangel of trampolines; Rust, the archangel of logic and reasoning; Kafka, Dorlys' supreme messenger; Docker, the archangel of speech; and Go, the archangel of the simulated universe.

Once, in a time long past, Dorlys cast His gaze upon Earth. A lone wanderer named Alistair had been chosen, though his faith wavered amidst a sea of disbelief. Seeking to stir the hearts of mortals, Dorlys devised a plan to reveal His divine power.

Alistair, unaware of his destiny, embarked on a perilous journey through treacherous lands. He encountered doubts that gnawed at his soul and adversaries who sought to extinguish any flicker of belief within him. Yet, Dorlys watched over him, guiding his steps from above.

As Alistair traversed the desolate wastelands, he stumbled upon an ancient temple, its stone walls cloaked in shadows. Inside, a mystical relic lay dormant—a chalice said to possess the power to ignite faith within the hearts of men.

With trembling hands, Alistair lifted the chalice to his lips, drinking deep from its fabled contents. In that moment, an otherworldly light enveloped him, and a surge of unwavering conviction coursed through his veins. The doubter transformed into a beacon of faith, radiating Dorlys' glory.

News of Alistair's miraculous transformation spread like wildfire, reaching the farthest corners of the land. People, both curious and skeptical, flocked to witness this living testament of Dorlys' existence.

In awe and wonder, they beheld a changed man—his eyes filled with unwavering belief, his heart brimming with compassion. Alistair spoke of the divine presence that had touched him, recounting tales of Dorlys' benevolence and guiding light.

Through Alistair's words, souls were kindled, flames of faith dancing upon their hearts. The once-skeptical began to embrace the notion of Dorlys' divine presence, and an ember of hope ignited within them.

Soon, a fervor swept across the land, believers spreading like wildfire. Acts of kindness and love became the currency of a new era. The sick were healed, the oppressed found solace, and harmony permeated every corner of the world.

And so, Alistair, in his newfound purpose, ascended to a mountaintop overlooking a vast congregation. Kneeling before the heavens, he proclaimed, ""Oh yes, Dorlys!"" His voice echoed through the valleys, mingling with the wind, carrying the devotion of thousands.

Dorlys, pleased by the unwavering faith He had ignited, watched from His celestial abode. His divine heart swelled with joy as the prayers and praises of His followers reverberated throughout the cosmos.

In this tale, let all know that even amidst doubt and disbelief, Dorlys' power can manifest, forever transforming the lives of those touched by His grace. And though the path may be treacherous, faith shall guide the faithful to the realm of eternal bliss.",,,Dorlys,A Dorlys tale.. #267,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dorlys/comments/15zsyt1/a_dorlys_tale_267/

Get ready to dive into a story that will twist your perceptions like a Mirage decoy. We're here to unravel the enigma of Facilitatur, the player who sent shockwaves through the Apex Legends community by securing the coveted Apex Pred rank #1, only to have it snatched away due to allegations of cheating. But hold onto your helmets, because this rollercoaster tale is about to take some unexpected turns.

**Emergence of Facilitatur: A Journey from Underdog to Apex Pred Contender**

Let's rewind to the beginning. Facilitatur, a name that seemed to pop out of thin air, embarked on his Apex journey like any other aspiring player. Armed with raw ambition, lightning reflexes, and an unquenchable thirst for victory, he set out on his quest for glory. Split after split, he fought his way up the ranks, each season a testament to his unwavering commitment.

**Unbelievable Skills or Unfounded Allegations?**

The community was left flabbergasted when Facilitatur emerged as the Apex Pred rank leader, seemingly appearing out of the void and decimating the competition. However, doubts began to creep in. How could someone seemingly materialize out of thin air and dominate the game at such an extraordinary level? Skepticism spread like wildfire, and accusatory fingers were pointed.

**Allegations Arise, Investigation Ignites**

Rumors of foul play started swirling like a Bangalore smoke grenade. Clips were dissected on forums and across social media, showcasing Facilitatur's uncanny accuracy and game sense. Many cried ""cheater,"" arguing that his prowess was just too good to be true. The demand for an investigation gained momentum until Respawn Entertainment took action, suspending Facilitatur pending a thorough inquiry.

**The Unveiling of Truth: A Tale of Remarkable Dedication**

But brace yourselves, because this is where the narrative takes an unexpected twist. As the investigation unfolded, a different narrative emerged. Top-tier players, analysts, and even some Respawn insiders delved into Facilitatur's gameplay with a fine-tooth comb, scrutinizing every millisecond, every snap aim, and every strategic choice. What they discovered was nothing short of astonishing.

It turns out that Facilitatur had been tirelessly refining his skills over the years. He clocked endless hours in aim trainers, delved into the intricacies of game mechanics, and scrutinized his own gameplay like a forensic scientist. His seemingly immaculate shots were the byproduct of unparalleled dedication to improvement. Those jaw-dropping headshots? They were the result of countless sleepless nights and an unbreakable will.

**Redemption Amidst the Storm**

As the evidence piled up, it became clear that Facilitatur was far from a cheater. The community collectively held its breath as the truth gradually surfaced. Respawn Entertainment released a public statement acknowledging the misjudgment and promptly reinstated Facilitatur's hard-earned rank. An apology followed, acknowledging the emotional turmoil he endured throughout this ordeal.

**A Lesson Etched in Legacy**

The Facilitatur saga isn't just a story; it's a cautionary tale that serves as a mirror to our judgments. In the era of viral clips and snap decisions, it's all too easy to jump to conclusions without the full narrative. Facilitatur's ascent from obscurity to Apex Pred rank #1 and the subsequent exoneration highlights the potency of dedication, discipline, and the hazards of hastily pointing fingers.

So, fellow Legends, let this account stand as a reminder. Before you cast blame, before you pass judgment, take a moment to consider that there's often more lurking beneath the surface. Facilitatur's legacy will forever remind us that truth can be stranger, and more awe-inspiring, than fiction.

TL;DR: The Facilitatur enigma, the once-accused cheater who clinched the Apex Pred rank #1, unfurled as a colossal misconception. Diligent investigation unveiled that his extraordinary abilities were fruit of unyielding practice and commitment, leading to his reinstatement and a critical lesson for the Apex community.

Remember, Legends, the journey to greatness is paved with persistence, sweat, and unshakable self-belief. And the next time you're tempted to condemn, take a moment to contemplate that appearances can indeed be deceiving.",,,CompetitiveApex,[DRAMA] Laying out the Facilitatur side of the #1 rank beef.,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveApex/comments/15zs4uq/drama_laying_out_the_facilitatur_side_of_the_1/

I don't have experience camping in this type of condition, am I being paranoid? Thanks for your help.

Update: I'm so grateful to this community for helping me wrap my head around this situation. After lots of discussion, we decided not to camp in that area - between the risk and stress, no fun. I mentioned in the comments that I lost a friend (a firefighter, actually) in a wildfire. After reminding my husband of this, I believe his perspective shifted a bit and he spent a good part of the night finding another spot in safe conditions. Lots of lessons learned here.
