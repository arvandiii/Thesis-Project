160h4dz,griffonia at war as of,the major factions histories ideologies shit most are just their normal historical paths with certain changes ie nothing till will change for the griffonian republic this is also kinda thing too griffonian republic after undergoing serious economic and military reform the republic stands as one of the few beacons of harmonist democracy on the continent after the lord protector unified the herzland the skyfall republic joined their northern neighbor in an attempt to stave off invasion whether it works is for the future to decide president kemerskai now deals with refugee crisis after the fall of the herzland and gridlock congress determined for vengence but unsure at what time griffonian empire after the death of the emperor the empire was taken over by radical military forces in an attempt to save it however instead they brought it to ruin the lord protector ferdinand dawnclaw has ruled the empire for years and has just recently solidified his power recently he has been speaking with wingried von katerinburg united socialist river states following the election of nova whirl the equestria of the east slowly turned red much like the trade routes socialism would follow spreading like wildfire to other parts of the riverlands in in an attempt to stave off the growing hostilities in the west all but one of the coltstream treaty members the diamond dogs agreed to join the now born socialist federation however almost as soon as the nation was born it faced trouble as hector lipizzan staunch anti communiust launched revolt against the new federation carmel haze officer of the red army would soon seize the apparatus of state to maintain order however after dealing with the threat he did not step down and now rules as the chairpony of the east aquelia after being in war for over year doesn want to be in another but will of it must currently in the midst of electing its president its path is not yet decided equus basically just the historical paths except for one nation the last city after terrible accident by scientists in the crystal empire the region of polaria has been submerged in blizzard that ranges from to it up to the iron captain jorik to make sure the iron city survives at all costs republic of aris the history of aris in recent years can be blamed one one person the storm king after suprise attack that resulted in the death of queen novo the hippogriffs hid under the waves for two years they sat afraid the traumatized queen skystar sat waiting until the element bearers arrived during the battle of ain trotgourait queen skystar was killed by stay bullet thus ending the line of novo as silverstream fell later that day with no future heirs to the throne the nation plummeted into chaos after brief interm military government headed by marshal skyranger following failed elite rule republic was formed and elections were held in for new leader on march th date which shall live in infamy the united forces of colthage chiropterra and wingbardy declared war on aris determined to sink their fleet isolated and alone its up to president frost dare to rally the nation to arms and fight off the invaders chiropterra after carrot stick seized control of the country in and made his reforms the small zebrican nation has industrialized heavily boosting the most modern military in the region although navally its nowhere on par with the arisians their alliance with both colthage and wingbardy will see them hopefully clear path to take equestria when the time comes however many in the old guard see problems with this strick adherence to time tables what if the arisian navy is still threat in when they agreed to attack equestria with the changlings how many fronts can they afford to open,equestriaatwar,https://www.reddit.com/r/equestriaatwar/comments/160h4dz/griffonia_at_war_as_of_1010/,0

160gku7,people online are blaming historical irrigation decisions for the lahaina fire think this underestimates the extent that dry areas are naturally present on the hawaiian islands and therefore fails to recognize how many places are potentially at risk,ve seen lot of people claim that lahaina used to be lush well irrigated area prior to interventions by plantations resorts etc often as an answer to the question of how can place like hawaii have wildfire however my understanding of the climate of the hawaiian islands is that the main islands usually have dry side due to rain shadows caused by mountains and that lahaina is in one of those rain shadows this has resulted in the evolution of unique dry ecosystems on the islands including on maui and specifically in the lahaina area per this page link in general high mean rainfall is found on the windward mountain slopes and low rainfall prevails in leeward lowlands and on the upper slopes of the highest mountains per this map link lahaina is subtropical thorn woodland type of very dry ecosystem filled with plants adapted to dry conditions there even nonprofit organizations dedicated to studying and raising public awareness of these dry ecosystems on the hawaiian islands link in this context when people say lahaina used to be lush it confuses me was lahaina initially irrigated with water from the wet side of the island was it initially dry but became more dry even if there was irrigation which allowed for ponds or lush gardens would it really change the fact that the whole area is very dry would it have really somehow fundamentally changed the area to such an extreme extent in contemporary examples of dry areas receiving massive amounts of irrigation like golf courses in arizona or nevada the surrounding area is not any less dry the irrigated portion is still very small compared to the surrounding area wooden structures in the area would still burn if shower of embers were blown across them it seems to me like the nonnative grasses and perhaps lack of brush clearing would be much more significant factor than irrigation rerouting if the natural landscape was already dry to begin with as well as issues with things like electric lines not being buried electric lines not having available modifications to make them less likely to start fire electric companies not having power shutoff plans for periods of high wildfire risk etc all factors that could be at play in other dry areas and therefore put other dry areas at risk it would make much more sense to me if the discussion of this issue of what made lahaina vulnerable to fire included general discussion of the fact that the hawaiian islands do have many naturally dry areas which just like lahaina are at increasing risk of catastrophic fire due to climate change land mismanagement poor infrastructure and insufficient planning would appreciate any feedback or clarification,maui,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/160gku7/people_online_are_blaming_historical_irrigation/,0
