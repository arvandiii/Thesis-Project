16f7bio,stupid but real question,"i've been a regular for 9 years now and have noticed so much bullshit every single day. i haven't had nightmare management yet but mostly from my own co workers. my question is, the post office spends so much money on people to oversight theft and whatnot. yet not one person i have known has gotten fired. literally someone brought a weapon to work and got ""fired"" for years only to be back as management with all that back pay. how is that possible? can you actually be fired as a regular?",USPS,https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/16f7bio/stupid_but_real_question/,0
16f7ber,help optimising to fire,"throwaway as my reddit account uses my name. i think i’ve been relatively savy up until now but looking for some advice guidance from those with more experience with optimising my income as best i can from a tax and savings perspective. i’m 38, work in tech with a base salary of 193k and 35% bonus. i understand i’m fortunate but i’ve worked super hard to get here so looking to optimise this as best i can for my family. i am the sole earner with 3 kids. current situation is: - cash (flexible savings accounts - marcus / chase) : 40k - isa : 18k - pension : 140k - i think i can take this at 57?! - shares / crypto : 28k company offer me 5% pension contribution and i’ve been adding 18% - is this optimum? i realise my isa is quite low but as i can salary sacrifice i’ve been focusing on pension - added 40k last tax year - similar or slightly more this year. looking for advice on if people were in my situation how would they optimise as best they can? i don’t want to live a super frugal life but conscious of saving for the future as well so i can retire as early as possible! really appreciate any thoughts / advice. will update with any details if i’ve missed anything. thank you",FIREUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/16f7ber/help_optimising_to_fire/,0

16f7ao0,not again gahhh,"i feel like i am the biggest idiot to exist when it comes to queer women. the last few years have been a roller coaster for me and it's not that i'm looking for something or someone, it just so happens that a person enters my life and i randomly fall for them. i don't fall for someone that easily and i'm demisexual, so it takes some time. if i do fall for them, it's not something i expect. i get to know them and yeah, it just happens. it doesn't happen with anyone, but only certain people i get to know along the way. now i fell for a person who is just beyond what i imagined to feel a bond with. it's the most intense i've ever had. it confuses me since i didn't sought out for it. tension is there but i have no idea what to believe anymore, since a lot happened in between. i have trust issues so i retract mostly, but we climbed into each other's minds and in presence i can ""feel"" her. i don't know how to describe that, though i would say it's me being highly empathic, but with her it just feels unreal... in the start of getting to know her i avoided touching her for months since i knew that touching her would just set a fire that i'm not ready to feed. the first time we hugged i just... god. it was quick but it broke down a wall and after that the slight touches just made me crazy. i always looked her in the eyes (i don't look people in the eyes) and knew that she knew what she was doing. in my peripheral i could see her stare at me when we watch a movie or series i'm passionate about, or if i talk about a topic i'm deeply interested she just admires that and i did the same. there's a lot more, but i don't think there's going to be enough room for everything on here. but like every situation with me, there's someone else involved. her friend likes her and yeah it just kind of turned into a friends with benefits kind of thing, maybe more. so i just stepped back a lot. this is more of a vent that i am once again the idiot, that i should've been more open and talked about it instead of retracting because someone was actually getting close.. i never really talked about how i felt, or admitted to anything. so please, for the love of god, go tell your crush you like them, go fucking tell them now for my sake. ask the person you're falling for on a date. look into their eyes and take that chance, before its too late. if it doesn't work out, you'll know and have an answer. if it does work out, by the gods just celebrate for me. sorry if my grammar is off. i'm a bit emotional",actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/16f7ao0/not_again_gahhh/,0
16f7ajt,looking for advice/critique of my world creation myth,"this is my first serious dive into making my own world from top down (i have plenty of time before the campaign would even consider starting so i thought i'd get some of the big picture things out of the way). to that end i have generated a world map and the first regional map where my players would start. my next step to keep things logical and straight in my mind was to work up a creation myth. i gave quite a bit of thought to the various troupes of dnd/real world creation myths and found that a few really stuck out to me; monotheism or one god begets everything, dragons first b/c they are cool rawr, titans vs gods. all of these seem tired and overdone, but i really wanted to work up a new set of deities and have a convincing enough world creation myth. in my research and seeking for some advice i found a video my [monarchsfactory]( LINK in which she details how most creation stories have four common themes; authority, harbor, power, and treachery. it made a lot of sense and allowed me to put a semblance of structure into my own story. please feel free to read it over and give feedback. but please please let me know if you think this is overused, tired, or just super lame. thanks in advance for taking time our of your day (or night) to help out! \*\*\*\* the primordials were the first beings to take on sentience and arise from their elements found scattered around the realm. soon they began to shape the realm into pleasing forms; mountain ranges, raging volcanos, vast depths of oceans, and wind swept plains. for many decades the primordials were content to wander; creating and destroying, with little regard for anything else. however, as times passed they grew weary of the constant cycle and craved more. they began creating smaller beings in their image setting them loose to entertain. soon these elementals began fighting with each other to curry favor, power, and fame from their primordial creators. loosing interest in the wars of their brethren the four greatest of the primordials rose up seeking something more; erta, fyr, wyden, and sae. each of these controlled one of the four elements; earth, fire, wind, and water. in secret they began connecting to the deep elemental magic seeking unconceived magic, after deep meditation they soon gained the ability to create more then just mirrors of themselves. using this new ability they created a new race of mortal beings, and gave them domain over the central plains in the realm. the four used their influence among the rest of the primordials to declare their creation protected and to be shielded from any elementals skirmishes. for nearly a decade the mortals grew, learned, and built unaccosted by any elemental influence. eventually the mortal need for more outweighed their desire for safety, and they began venturing forth from the protection of the plains. thus began the elementbane war. for fifteen long years the mortals and the elementals fought. the former for land, resources, knowledge, and power. the later for the esteem it would provide to their primordial masters. with the limitless supply of elements any advantage the mortals could muster in their war was fruitless. seeing their creation dwindling the four stepped in to offer their knowledge of creation magic. four mortals were chosen and imbued with this power, two lovers and two siblings. the mortals adapted these magics as a counter to the power of the elements; day the power to give life, dusk the power of senescence, night the power to take life, dawn the power of renewal. these new mortal heroes ventured into the lands using the magic of creation, creating a powerful seal which limited the numbers of the elementals altogether. the seal would take several years, enchantments, and mortal battles to achieve. however, once in place the war was suddenly at an end. in a twist of fate this great seal also diminished the power of the primordials. and as the primordial power waned the magics of the heroes grew. the mortals began worshipping their heroes, taking to calling them the wheel of renewal. in a bid for peace erta, fyr, wyden and sae reached out to the wheel. bolstered by the fervor of their followers the wheel turned their increased creation magics toward the primordials. a second seal was created laid down, banishing the ancient race of primordials from the realm, claiming it in the name of their mortals. in an act of 'grace' the wheel spared the four primordials who gave them their power. in the next instance; erta was returned to the rock, fyr was rejoined with fire, wyden swept into the wind, and sae dragged to the depths of an ocean. and as such they were banished to become one with their own element in their own realm. but such magics weren't without effect and their own mortal realm was split into shards; one for each aspect of the wheel.",worldbuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/16f7ajt/looking_for_advicecritique_of_my_world_creation/,0

16f7a80,"hey fellas, wanna help me diagnose my hemi tick?","**unit:** 2013 ram 1500 sport - mds 5.7 hemi - just passed 285,000km (177,000m) - original owner, 95% highway miles. her name is lulu. **relevant service history:** very diligent service history, never neglected, typically change oil every 5,000 - 7,000 km using royal purple 5w20 & k&n hp 1017 filter. installed a borla type s cat-back exhaust about 10,000km ago (important point). k&n cold air intake. the engine runs extremely well, it sounds like a clean-running hemi and has lots of power. consistent fuel mileage. no codes. live-read scan normal. at 166,400km, i replaced warped manifolds and broken studs on both side. used oem mopar parts. roughly 15,000km ago, i discovered an exhaust leak (1"" x 1/2"") just before the muffler. i drove the unit for about 5,000km with the leak before installing a borla type s cat-back exhaust system, which i've been running for about 10,000km now. **current issue:** fast forward to last week. i started up the engine while parked beside a wall, and heard a pronounced, very noticeable hemi tick on the drivers side. i figured ok, we're changing out manifold studs again pretty soon. no biggie. ....but then the tick didn't go away when it warmed up... and she's still ticking. last night, i spent 45 minutes crawling around the truck to locate the source of the tick. usually you can wiggle the manifold heat shield, and if it moves, you've got broken studs. failing that, you can usually see leaking exhaust gas or stains where it's not sealing. i couldn't see any issues, and i don't want to remove the heat shields yet in case i break those studs (i work remote, not home for 2 more weeks). i even crawled under the unit while it was cold and used the remote start to fire up the engine. i cannot pin point this ticking noise for the life of me, but it's definitely drivers side, and definitely somewhere around the manifold / bottom of the engine. **thoughts / possible diagnosis:** 1. cracked d/s exhaust manifold and/or studs. likely caused by increased temperature fluctuation after fixing the exhaust leak and installing a high-flow performance cat back. manifold possibly warped. 2. worn out lifter & scored cam shaft lobe (please, hemi gods, no) 3. ?? **tldr / any ideas?:** can't visually locate a constant & pronounced hemi tick. **any ideas on other ways a guy can confirm the suspected manifold leak, lifter issue, or something else?** i have a full hd mechanic shop & tools at my disposal, but virtually no relevant parts for a hemi. i'm in the absolute middle of nowhere in northern canada. maybe cut the heat shield by the top 2 mounts and fold it back so i don't risk snapping a stud? when i get home in 2 weeks, i can pull everything apart and really get into it, but i want to make sure it's an exhaust issue and my engine isn't going to explode on my way home. thanks fellas, sorry for the long post, but it's keeping me up at night. she's my baby. &#x200b; &#x200b;",ram_trucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/ram_trucks/comments/16f7a80/hey_fellas_wanna_help_me_diagnose_my_hemi_tick/,0

16f73qv,i'm at a loss with my incredible but insecure mom...,"my mother (50f) is incredible. she has raised me (19m) by herself for almost my entire life. i've caused my mom a lot of grief and headaches over the years... which i regret immensely. over the past 6 years our relationship has been incredible! especially after some rough teenage years. i love my mother. i appreciate everything she does and has done for me and i want her to be happy and healthy. i hug her and tell her that i love her every day. i want to take care of her as much as i can. (note: i am in college but still live at home. not sure if this is relevant) unfortunately, my mom's mental health has never been anywhere good (even before having me!)... she has stated that she would have taken her own life years ago if it wasn't for having me. it's incredibly sad and discouraging, not to mention concerning, to hear this stuff from her. she likely has depression, anxiety, ptsd and a lot of other mental health issues. the thing is, she's incredibly stubborn and has always refused to seek help. (until very recently) she always says that no one would believe her or would hear her out or help her with her issues. recently, she applied for a different position at her job. it would be the same job, with the same pay except for one additional task. one she is incredibly insecure about. that's because my mom is an immigrant and her language skills have always been an insecurity for her. she applied for the job. and got it! i was so incredibly proud of her for stepping out of her comfort zone and taking a risk! but she's been calling in sick for a week straight, since the starting date because she's crippled with fear and anxiety. about not being able to handle it, being laughed at, etc. it's so difficult to see her go through this stuff... especially since it is not the first time. (some years ago, she had a week long episode because fucking tarrot cards told her she would get fired. which did not happen. big surprise.) she is constantly crying... and saying that she should have never applied for the position and that she destroyed everything she had built. i tried to remind her that the job has a 2 month trial period during which she can just quit and return to her old station. however, she's affraid to be judged and laughed at. she's planning to stay home for a other 2 weeks because she (finally) has an appointment with a psychiatrist. she plans to use that appointment as an excuse to get out of the job due to ""health reasons."" i've offered to help her with anything and everything she might need but she says that only a miracle can fix this... i don't know what to do anymore. i love my mom so much. and i'm so worried. i've been worried... for years. i just feel so powerless.",rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/16f73qv/im_at_a_loss_with_my_incredible_but_insecure_mom/,0

it may be tough, but it's not impossible. legging out past $500 million is plausible on the domestic front (that would be a multiplier of at least 2.7), and another $500 million abroad would be a drop of around $58 million from the original after excluding the two mia markets. it'd be another story if audiences didn't love the film,but the positive reception suggests that wakanda forever will outperform the legs on this year's earlier mcu titles (multiverse of madness and love and thunder had multipliers of 2.2 and 2.3 respectively). &#x200b; as for the rest of the box office, there's little to get excited about, with nothing else grossing above $10 million as hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends. when watch ‘mavka: the forest song opened in 2018, there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend, but peter rabbit and fifty shades freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $17.5 million and $17.3 million respectively. that weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend take away the $22 million gap between the two watch ‘mavka: the forest song films and there's still a $57 million gap between the two weekends. the difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses,but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months. &#x200b; watch ‘mavka: the forest song, which is the biggest grosser of the rough post-summer, pre-wakanda forever season, came in second with just $8.6 million. despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend, the numbers didn't totally collapse, dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million. worldwide it is at $352 million, which isn't a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget. still, it's the biggest of any film since thor: love and thunder, though wakanda forever will overtake it any day now. &#x200b; watch ‘mavka: the forest song came in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the season's most durable grossers and one of the year's few bright spots when it comes to films for adults. the domestic cume is $56.5 million fourth place went to lyle, lyle, crocodile, which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $3.2 million sixth weekend and $40.8 million cume., in fact ) &#x200b; , which isn't surprising considering it's the only family film on the market, and it's close to grossing four times its $11.4 million opening. still, the $72.6 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget , though a number of international markets have yet to open. &#x200b; finishing up the top five is watch ‘mavka: the forest song, which had its biggest weekend drop yet, falling 42% for a $2.3 million seventh weekend. of course, that's no reason to frown for the horror film, which has a domestic cume of $103 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million. &#x200b; the one new specialty title of note comes from a filmmaker we don't typically associate with the specialty box office: steven spielberg. the beard's semi-autobiographical family drama watch ‘mavka: the forest song opened in four theaters in new york and los angeles to $160k, a $40k average. the film expands to 600 theaters the day before thanksgiving, and it has the potential to break out in a way that none of the other of the season's awards contenders have. we're also seeing very solid numbers from watch ‘mavka: the forest song, which grossed $1.7 million this weekend for a seventh place finish, bringing its cume to $5.8 &#x200b; looking for a way to watch mavka: the forest song online for free?

stall and its head stuck out in the aisle. we were in the stables, having gotten up bright and early to get a start on the day. we’d already eaten and now we just had to grab the list, level up, then a quick run in the shops before heading to the cliffs. “is he following us?” shift shrugged. “i just wanted to make sure i wasn’t imagining things.” *hex: i am sure that is the same horse from the rest stop.* “well, we can’t do anything about that,” i said. “let’s just get a move-on.” we exited the stables and the morning sun hit as we entered the plaza. there was a wooden sign near the temple and we stopped there first. *bounties for the following:* *cyrilla: tiny plant with thick sickle-shaped leaves, a mint green. the flowers can be light purple, bronze, or black. bring to the watching elixir.* *flower blossoms from cassia plant: thick heart-shaped leaves, red flowers. bring to the watching elixir* *howlite stone: stone that was touched by a quilcera. bring to the hammer* *any artifacts. bring to the crafting guildhall* “hopefully, we can find some of that,” i said to shift. she nodded, and we both copied the list down. they weren’t quests, so we needed to remember them on our own. i entered the temple first, and there were two doors plus a man behind a window in the open room. “welcome to crestport’s temple,” said david. “ah, i see you need to level. i also have a package for you.” “yeah, some arrows?” i asked. “plus a cloak.” he nodded, pushing a folded cloth and arrows across the counter. “you’re lucky these are common items. we already had some stock here. if you want to level, the room on the right is open.” he turned toward shift. “i have some things here for you as well.” i added the new items to my inventory, including the cloak, and headed to the room to level. the room was exactly what i expected, with a chair in the center. i quickly walked over and sat down. “welcome. congratulations, you can level up your stats. it will cost 200 bitz. do you want to proceed?” “yes, please.” the chair leaned back and my screen shifted to asking what changes i wanted to make to my stats. i added a point to str, int, and con. then 2 points to dex. i hit the confirm button, then everything went dark. i hadn’t been out long when i opened my eyes again. first things first, i opened my character sheet. *name: mia* *level: 6* *hitpoints: 24* *mana: 22* *strength: 8* *intelligence: 10* *dexterity: 13* *constitution: 12* that was good progress, and i grabbed the helm. i stood up quickly from the chair. things spun a little and i steadied myself by grabbing the armrest. “that’s weird,” i said. *“you should have been out for a couple more minutes to recover. i’m surprised you're up,”* said hex. *“eh, i just want to keep moving.”* shift waited for me in the open room. “ready?” she asked. “yes, let's check a few stores then get outta here.” the plaza was quiet as we crossed it and headed to the shops down the road. there was a line of them just like at haven, but it was the street just off of the plaza rather than directly surrounding it. the road eventually led to another gate, which was opened. bright blue water filled the distance. “that must lead to the docks and the sea,” i said. the first shop was the blacksmith’s, but they weren’t open yet. neither was the general store, but the leatherworker shop was open. i opened the door and was greeted by a large rack of different boots. a bell clanged on the door. the wall to the right of the shoes had vests and other leather bits hung up. “coming!” called a voice from the back doorway. “sorry, usually we aren’t open this early but i heard the caravan came in.” a woman older than me walked through the opening. her eyes were bright green, and she had a big smile. a large apron covered the linen shirt and pants she was wearing. *willow, leatherworker.* “oh, hi! i have a letter for you from gramps.” i quickly grabbed the letter out of my inventory. “did i hear gramps!” a young woman much closer to my age darted out of the back room. again bright green eyes but darker hair. *eliza, leatherworker.* “you’re wearing my boots?!” i glanced down at my boots. “i guess so, eliza, right?” willow took the letter and quickly opened it up. “what do you think of them? how are they holding up?” “i love them!” i said. “can i upgrade them? i saw upgrades in the token store like stuff to make me quieter as i walk.” her eyes narrowed. “i can do that, but starting with a pair of new boots would be easier. those are one of my first designs. my new ones i can upgrade faster.” she motioned to the wall of shoes. “yeah, i am not giving these up. best shoes i’ve ever had.” her eyes flickered to shift's sandals. “i also have better than those, even for monks.” her hand darted out, and she pulled something off one rack up high. eliza tossed them at shift. “try those on.” eliza turned back to me. “how about i pull a set together for you and you can try them on? i’ll upgrade them and everything.” i thought about it for a moment, but i really wanted to keep my boots. “maybe… i’ll try them on.” “you want stealth with sound canceling?” asked eliza. “can i get some of that too?” asked shift. she was tying the sandals on her feet. “these are awesome!” “i’ll need those back, it will take me a few hours.” “that’s okay, we’re going to head into the cliffs then be back in town,” i said. “well, i’ll need you to pay upfront,” she said. “just in case you don’t come back.” shift gave her a thumbs up and started unlacing the new sandals. willow’s eyes were wide staring at the letter, and she looked strange. “you okay?” i asked softly. her head snapped up. “yeah, i appreciate you bringing this. your upgrade can be on the house.” “mother?” asked eliza. “no, this is important.” she turned to eliza. “gramps wants to come live with us and close the shop in haven.” my eyes opened wide. “that’s awesome, i’d love some hands-on learning from him, said eliza. “i miss him so much. it’s about time, you have been asking him to join us for like five years. maybe one of our apprentices wants to go take over?” willow nodded absentmindedly. “i need to see what he sent on the caravan,” she said as she headed out of the shop. shift stepped up. “so how much for the sandals?” “10 bitz,” she said, holding out her hand. they quickly shook. “yeah, most of the shops won’t open for another hour. anyway, you’ll want to head to the storm cliffs before the afternoon storms hit.” “afternoon storms?” i asked. “it's why they're called the storm cliffs. every afternoon, lightning and thunder. but only for an hour. then it usually clears up.” i glanced at shift, and she shrugged. “good to know, thanks!” once outside we turned back the way we had come from the plaza. “i feel like we should have known that.” “me too.” *hex: sorry, i didn’t think to look it up.* “you can’t be all-knowing,” i said. shift agreed. between the temple and the crafting guild, was a narrow path that led in the correct direction. there was even a wooden arrow. the gate heading out of town was right behind the two buildings, and it was the size of a door. it was open, and we both walked through. the path wound upward through a thicket of trees. sounds of birds immediately hit our ears and boulders appeared here and there. the trees thinned out after a while of walking. a giant wooden sign was next to the trail, and a cavern loomed five feet behind it. the opening was narrow. a white line crossed the trail right behind the wooden sign. “that’s strange,” i muttered. *hex: it's the level cap line. if you are over level ten you can’t cross.* “smart.” i focused on the sign, someone had carved a lightning bolt into the wood. *welcome to the storm cliffs. level 10 and below can proceed. explore your first dungeon, and we hope you collect some bounty items. good luck!* the list of the bounty items from the plaza were also here. “you ready?” shift asked. “let’s do this.” “wait!” we both turned and a male figure was running out from between the trees. *luteon, level 12* *hex: it’s that dude.* *shift: our views just spiked.* *hex: uh oh.* he kept running right at us and slowed as he approached. “i wanted to thank you,” his brown eyes stared at me. they flickered up to the helm, studying it. *hex: i have a bad feeling about this.* *shift: me too.* *mia: yeah, step back a few feet.* shift moved next to me and took a few small steps back. not a ton, but it gave me some space. “for what?” i asked. “for helping with the owlbear. i thought i was a goner.” he held out his hand, “luteon.” when i didn’t take his hand, he let it drop. “i don’t see that other fellow, branch was it?” i looked over his shoulder. “no, he didn’t make it.” “oh, sorry. i didn’t realize.” “you wouldn’t know.” he didn’t look sorry at all. luteon gave me a soft smile. “i was wondering if you wanted to join my party, we could head down to the majestic forest. the,” his eyes flickered to shift, “three of us would make a good group. we can prepare for the realm quest.” *mia: you behind the line?* *shift: yeah, it's three steps behind you* “we’re gonna hit up this dungeon,” i said. “maybe another time.” i turned toward shift. “mia!” i activated force shield. bright pink light glowed all around me. i looked over my shoulder and luteon was now several steps back. i let the shield drop as i joined shift. “now, you listen to me.” he rotated his shoulder as he approached. this time his voice was more demanding. “we need to have a chat…” his knee smacked into something and he froze. “that’s new,” i said. *hex: the ai won’t let him cross.* he suddenly stumbled back. “you were saying?” i asked, trying not to smirk. “you can’t stay in there forever, i’ll just wait here for you,” he hissed. he planted both of his feet right behind the white line. i narrowed my eyes, “why do you want to chat?” “how much do you want for the helm?” he asked. “not for sale,” i said with a nod and turned back toward shift. “let’s go.” “everyone has a price!” i kept walking toward the narrow opening to the cavern, following shift. it darkened pretty quickly inside the entrance and shift pulled out a torch. she lit it. “let’s go deeper.” after another couple of minutes, nothing showed up on my map and she paused. *shift: what was that?* *mia: no idea, but he really wanted hex.* *hex: me or the helm. he might not know about me.* *shift: did someone put a bounty on it?”* *mia: bounty?* *shift:…* *hex: there is a black market. i can’t access it, but some guilds are part of it. they look for certain items and such. maybe the helm is listed?* *mia: great. let’s just focus on this. he can’t come in here. who knows if he’ll actually wait?* shift gave me a look, but she said nothing. instead, she motioned for me to go first. *shift: i’ll carry the torch, this way your vision will be better.* i gave her a thumbs up and triggered sharp eye as we crawled deeper. the tunnel suddenly widened into an enormous cavern. jagged rocks covered the ceiling like teeth, and others jutted up from the ground. i could hear water dripping from somewhere. little specks glittered on the top. everything smelled damp. the map showed at least three passages that led off, but it didn’t cover the far side. *mia: any advice?* *hex: always stick to the leftmost wall and you will eventually make your way back* *shift: that’s smart.* *hex: i try to be helpful.* i headed to the leftmost passageway. sharp eye didn’t highlight anything, then i glanced upward again. a few of the jagged rocks glowed yellow. i approached one of the glowing ones, and it wiggled slightly. then it crashed downward. i dodge forward and more glowed. “run!” i sped toward the tunnel, my sharp eye making it easier to dodge the falling things. i stumbled into the opening of the tunnel with shift right on my heels. “what were those?” asked shift. we both looked back. *cavern worm, level 5* shift shivered. “yuck.” she still clenched the torch in her hands. “yeah, it's a whole bunch of them… hex, don’t let us forget.” *hex: i’ll try not to.* the tunnel itself narrowed to single file only, and i took the lead again. we tried to stay quiet and keep going. after a couple of twists, a beam of light shot down from an opening, making the cavern beyond hard to see. a bunch of red flowers grew in the light and i moved forward slowly. *cassia plant, do you want to use your harvesting kit?* i hit yes and lines showed up on how to cut the flowers off the thick stems. i added them to my bag. *shift: don’t move.* i froze. *shift: there’s something crawling along the ceiling. i think it's a spider. i can’t see it.* i triggered visual sounds and tried not to move. thin lines covered the entire area. so thin they looked like threads. they covered the cavern beyond the light beam. giant spiders crawled along the ceiling. the spiders moved slowly in our direction. *mia: spiders* *shift: i hate spiders!* *mia: are there any behind you?* *shift: idk!* the first hit the edge of my vision. *cavern spider, level 4* *mia: it's only level four.* *shift: we need to leave!* “ah!” came from behind me. the torch landed near my feet, and i scrambled backward for it as a spider jumped down. i dodged and grabbed the torch before it went out. i used torch attack, flinging the creature backward. fire spread from its body to the threads and it screamed. my eyes landed on the various threads and thicker web. i darted forward as another creature headed my way and swung the torch at the web covering the ceiling. it caught fire quickly, rushing toward the whole host of spiders as they lit up in red on my map. “oh, shit!” the flames moved from web to web but an enormous creature was on the far side of the cavern. the flames reached it and it turned in my direction. *cavern spider, level 9.* i dropped the torch to my feet and grabbed my bow, along with one of my new arrows. i took aim and fired as it moved, using a crippling shot. the leg closest to me collapsed, and i followed with another shot. the fire dripped from the burning web on the ceiling to the giant body of the spider. a few legs tried to put the flames out while it kept trying to move forward. i fired, again and again, using quickshot but with normal arrows. the second shot i activated powerful shot to try for a combination attack. the giant spider stumbled around the space spreading the fire to untouched webs. the smaller spiders perished as the fire hit them. i took aim and used a force bolt. the impact knocked the spider off of its feet and it crashed to the ground. its legs twitched, but i held onto another arrow, waiting. something moved near me, and i fired the arrow at a smaller spider that hadn’t caught fire yet. *cavern spider level 6*. the fire near me was already out. the web burned hot and fast, and then went out when there was no more fuel. “shit!” the spider pounced but something knocked it out of the air. shift held a fist out and followed up with another punch to the creature, then it became an x on the map. she grabbed the torch and charged at the gigantic spider, which was still twitching. she hit it a few times with the torch until it stopped moving and it died. “i hate spiders,” she said. a few more were quickly running away and we let them go. a treasure chest appeared on my map. it was near the back of the cavern. “is that a chest?” excitedly asked shift. “yeah, some bosses have them. they…” i took a breath. “can be loot from dead players.” her excitement dimmed a little as we approached together. i kept my bow out. the light from the torch showed a pile of bones. *do you want to loot the cavern spider’s nest?* i hit yes. *reward:* *shield* *dagger x 2* *leather gloves* *broken pet whistle* *405 bitz* “did you get anything good?” bitz were always a positive but the rest of it would be headed for the sale bin. still, that meant more bitz. shift shrugged then smiled reading her list. “some leather armor, sword, bitz…” “same, but what's a pet whistle?” i asked. shift shrugged. “that’s useful if you want to train a pet. most people go with horses or some sort of steed to get around if they don’t want to pay bitz for a shuttle.” *hex: it could be useful, but pet use has waned in the game. rangers used to keep pets.* “it's broken, but maybe i can fix it?” “no idea. this cavern is a dead end,” said shift. “i guess on to the next one?” “yeah…” it didn’t take us long to get back to the main cavern. the fallen cavern worms were gone, which was creepy. we stuck close to the wall which didn’t trigger any falling worms. the next tunnel sloped upwards. it was wide enough for us both to walk side by side. so we did. i kept my bow out but wished i had something besides my sword to use up close. a low howling caught us both by surprise. what now?",redditserials,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/16f72ki/the_warhog_paladins_derby_chapter_16_litrpg/,0

16f72bw,"remaking 1962’s the brain that wouldn’t die for a modern audience, while also adding stronger character motivations for the film’s villain.","as a long time mst3k fan i’ve technically seen the brain that wouldn’t die over 10 times, but only once without mike and the bots. there’s a pretty good movie in there somewhere, and i spent more time than is reasonable thinking about how to remake it for a modern audience by adding stronger character motivations inspired by today’s political/social climate. to start, i see the movie’s villain, bill cortner, as a cross between martin shkreli and stockton rush. on the off chance you aren’t familiar, shkreli is the pharma bro ghoul who raised the cost of aids medication over 5000%, and rush is the lunatic millionaire who got four people killed trying to reach the wreck of the titanic in a popcan submarine. so the tone i’m thinking here is similar too bodies, bodies, bodies. previllege permeats the air and a dark superficiality clouds everything. bill is not a doctor, at least not officially. instead he is a young, preppy rich kid born with the silverest of spoons in his mouth. his parents pulled a lori loughlin to get him into university where he was meant to become a medical doctor, but was mostly concerned with money, power and women. he flunked out. luckily, university was where he met kurt, a brilliant medical scientist at top of his class. like in the 1962 version, kurt was involved in an unfortuante accident, disfiguring his arm. this inspired him to write his dissertation on his revolutionary theories about transplantation. his work, however, was summarily rejected, dismissed as quackery, leaving him riddled with student debt and no where to turn. in kurt, bill saw opportunity. he offered kurt funding and resources to practice his controverial theories in exchange for a majority share of the credit and profits. in the present they run their experiments out of bill’s father’s secluded summer home, paying off a dirty coroner to aquire the corpses they need for their research. bill contributes very little to the research, he only understand the basics of kurt’s theories. instead he spends most of his time with jan compton, a former classmate and the only one of the three actually earn a medical license. bill waxes poetic about the work he and kurt are doing, claiming they’re punk rock doctors on the verge of changing the world. jan tries to show interest in what they’re up to, but whenever she presses for details bill claims its out of her league. he essentially negs her to stay out of his affairs. jan has a sense she’s fallen for the wrong person. on the surface she finds reasons to justify his behaviour, but deep inside she feels trapped by him. one night the two are drinking pool side, it’s one of those infinity pools that seamlessly leap off the edge of a mountain side. the two get into a huge fight about bill’s lack of respect and trust in jan. the fight continues upstairs into bill’s room and out to the balcony above the infinite pool. as the fight becomes more intense, jan slips, falling over the railing down towards the water where her head is lopped clean off by the pool’s glass barrier, leaving her head in the pool as her body disappears into the blackness of the cliff edge. looking at her head floating in the pool, bill sees his future disappearing. his chance at greatness, his god given right to fame and fortune. quickly he gets right to work, collecting her soggy head from the water, he immediately brings it to kurt, telling him to use the experimental serum they’ve developed to keep jan alive. kurt objects, reminding him of the locked cellar in the basement where another “experiement” lurks. jan awakes, in terrible pain, begging to be allowed to die. kurt, who has always had a crush on her, pleads with bill to end this madness, but he is too meek, and is overpowered by bill’s ego. determine to save his own ass, bill sets out in search of a replacement body. he ends up at a sketchy underground sex club hoping to isolate a victim. he finds a woman who matches jan’s features, but as he works to convince her to come with him, police raid the joint. bill escapes out the back and there is a chase in which he barely escapes the cops. back at the lab, jan tries to convince kurt to unplug her but he refuses to cross bill. kurt’s spinelessness disgusts jan, and she finally calls him out on it. feeling rejected from her once more, kurt lashes out, and promises her that even if bill brings her a new body she will live in agony forever. kurt leaves the lab slamming doors along the way. kurt’s footsteps become inaudible, and yet there is still a banging noise. jan realizes it’s coming from the cellar. the next morning bill leaves again to find a new body. he comes across an old friend, donna, walking alone, the perfect target. however, a friend of donna sees them and interrupts. bill is forced into having coffee with them both. visibly annoyed, bill tries over and over to end the interaction when donna reminds him of a mutual old friend, doris. she is a model horribly scared after suffering an abusive relationship. bill senses his fortunes are turning. in the lab, jan is learning to communicate with the cellar creature. kurt interrupts them, but is frightened by her ability to command the monster. meanwhile bill visits doris and convinces her he and kurt have discovered the secret to regenerating scars. he invites her to meet kurt for a consultation. back to the lab, kurt has resolved shoot the cellar creature in a bid to prove to jan he isn’t weak. as he opens the door’s port to shoot, jan alerts the creature of the danger and it violent grabs kurt’s good arm, ripping it to shreds. kurt dies. bill arrives back at the house with doris and feeds her a drink laced with a sedative. when he brings her body down into the lab he discovered the carnage. jan tells him it’s over, and to let her die. again he refuses, and resolves to perform the transplant himself. jan laughs, excusing him of the highest hubris and being a talentless drop out. bill, desperate and completely engulfed by his ego, retorts she has no idea what he is capable of. just as he begins to prep doris for surgery the door to the cellar burst open and out steps a grotesque monster, laden with half dead limbs. it pushes bill into a set of chemicals, starting a fire. the creature then find kurt’s gun, picks it up and points it at bill. jan shouts at the creature to stop. in a display of humanity, it stops and throws the gun away. jan and the creature exchange a knowing glace, and it picks up doris and carries her to safety leaving jan and bill to burn alive. so that’s my take. if you’re interested, i wrote this for my podcast, you can check out the full episode [here]( LINK thanks for reading, super interest to hear your

16f728t,18 jlur 19a clutch recall,"so my jeep is affected by the recall. my clutch went out and nearly caught fire at 25k miles. jeep has been sitting at the dealership since july because there are no updates for this recall and obviously no new clutch assembly to install yet. engineers denied the service department's request to replace the clutch with the original part number, but the service department said i can pay them to replace it with the old part number then request reimbursement through the recall. im not doing that because others have already been denied the reimbursement and we already know the part is no good and would just get the jeep on the road temproarily until it fails again, perhaps more drastically than the first time. i know i can just foot the bill and go aftermarket, but that idea pisses me off because i was sold a faulty product so they should fix it for free. my question is what are my best options here and what would you do? can i force jeep's hand to buy the jeep back? not sure how lemon laws work, bought it in california and now i live in nevada. jeep is paid off and i have a second vehicle. irritated that my lovely jeep is a paperweight sitting at a dealership for an unknown amount of time.",Wrangler,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wrangler/comments/16f728t/18_jlur_19a_clutch_recall/,0

16f707t,"i was groomed by a manager at work and want to report it, but i deleted most evidence. what can i do?","this is in northern virginia. i was groomed for a little over a year by a manager at the place i work. this all started over a year ago, and ended 7 months ago. i was underage (16) and he is in his mid 30’s, married and has a kid. he groomed me over text and we eventually started meeting up at hotels and other locations to have sex. he would buy me food at work, and compliment me a lot and i enjoyed the attention and had never gotten it before, and fell into his trap. about a month in he became physically, verbally and mentally abusive, saying that he would fire me if i left him. i didn’t want anyone to find out about me and him, so i couldn’t go to anyone for help. i didn’t want my mom or friends to think badly of me (my dad is out of the picture). i attempted messaging the man’s wife on facebook to tell her what was happening, but his wife apparently just asked him who that was and he said he had no idea and that it was probably a scam, so she blocked me and moved on. that happened a couple months in. this all went on for a year, until i turned 18 (age of consent in my state). i then got a boyfriend and told the man i would no longer listen to him. he told me to break up with my boyfriend, i said no, he said ok, and that was the end of it. now that some time has passed and i have gotten some other opinions on it, i am realizing a lot of things i hadn’t before, like that i was groomed and in fact not in a “relationship” with that man. since i was also underage, what he did is considered statutory rape if i’m correct. and he was married so that’s something else i’m sure. i am extremely regretful of my decisions at the time, and wish it had never happened. i am also angry that a year of my life was taken from me by him. i am also concerned that this man should not be working in a position of power over many underage girls (retail). i want to report it to the place i worked and the police, but am not sure how to go about that, and another issue is that i don’t have any evidence anymore. my boyfriend asked me to delete all the texts and photos i had with the man because he didn’t like that i had memories with my “ex” on my phone. he didn’t know the real story at the time, just that i had an ex. i do have a couple of screenshots of our texts showing the man being abusive, but nothing indicating we had a relationship. i think that the man might still have evidence on his phone, but without knowing for sure it’s not something i can go on. so what are my options for reporting to work and/or the authorities? i also still don’t want my family or friends to know about this, so is there a way i can just report it anonymously? or do i have to press charges and find a lawyer for anything to actually happen? and should i report it to the place i work? if so, how should i go about that?",legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/16f707t/i_was_groomed_by_a_manager_at_work_and_want_to/,0

it may be tough, but it's not impossible. legging out past $500 million is plausible on the domestic front (that would be a multiplier of at least 2.7), and another $500 million abroad would be a drop of around $58 million from the original after excluding the two mia markets. it'd be another story if audiences didn't love the film,but the positive reception suggests that wakanda forever will outperform the legs on this year's earlier mcu titles (multiverse of madness and love and thunder had multipliers of 2.2 and 2.3 respectively). &#x200b; as for the rest of the box office, there's little to get excited about, with nothing else grossing above $10 million as hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends. when watch ‘mavka: the forest song opened in 2018, there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend, but peter rabbit and fifty shades freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $17.5 million and $17.3 million respectively. that weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend take away the $22 million gap between the two watch ‘mavka: the forest song films and there's still a $57 million gap between the two weekends. the difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses,but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months. &#x200b; watch ‘mavka: the forest song, which is the biggest grosser of the rough post-summer, pre-wakanda forever season, came in second with just $8.6 million. despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend, the numbers didn't totally collapse, dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million. worldwide it is at $352 million, which isn't a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget. still, it's the biggest of any film since thor: love and thunder, though wakanda forever will overtake it any day now. &#x200b; watch ‘mavka: the forest song came in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the season's most durable grossers and one of the year's few bright spots when it comes to films for adults. the domestic cume is $56.5 million fourth place went to lyle, lyle, crocodile, which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $3.2 million sixth weekend and $40.8 million cume., in fact ) &#x200b; , which isn't surprising considering it's the only family film on the market, and it's close to grossing four times its $11.4 million opening. still, the $72.6 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget , though a number of international markets have yet to open. &#x200b; finishing up the top five is watch ‘mavka: the forest song, which had its biggest weekend drop yet, falling 42% for a $2.3 million seventh weekend. of course, that's no reason to frown for the horror film, which has a domestic cume of $103 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million. &#x200b; the one new specialty title of note comes from a filmmaker we don't typically associate with the specialty box office: steven spielberg. the beard's semi-autobiographical family drama watch ‘mavka: the forest song opened in four theaters in new york and los angeles to $160k, a $40k average. the film expands to 600 theaters the day before thanksgiving, and it has the potential to break out in a way that none of the other of the season's awards contenders have. we're also seeing very solid numbers from watch ‘mavka: the forest song, which grossed $1.7 million this weekend for a seventh place finish, bringing its cume to $5.8 &#x200b; looking for a way to watch mavka: the forest song online for free?

16f6v6c,pvp help for a newbie?,"hello, i am new to ac as a series but not to fromsoft games. to preface this whole text, my current playstyle is aggressive rushdown and my preferred build is lightweight with my most common weapons being **weapons** * handgun: hg-003 coquillet * pulse blade: hi-32 bu-tt/a * plasma missile launcher: vvc-70vpm * vertical missile launcher: bml-g1/po1vtc-04 * active homing missile launcher: bml-g3/po4act-01 **frame** * head: kasuar/44z * core: vp-40s * arms: el-ta-10 firmeza * legs: el-tl-10 firmeza * booster: alula/21e * fcs: fcs-g2/p10slt * generator: vp-20s * expansion: terminal armour so that's my go-to build for most if not all fights. what i want to know is what weapons benefit lightweight aggression. i want to float like a butterfly and sting like a sock full of quarters. to that end, i require as much information and nuance that you guys can spare. i need to know what makes explosives work in pvp, the benefit of full auto high fire rate vs full auto low fire rate and all of that. if you need me to condense my *specific* search queries i'd say i'm most interested and curious about the following junctions * handguns: kinetic, laser, idk what else is there, but how good are they? i enjoy using kinetic but the charged attacks from laser seem to be huge misses * explosives: tank treads the only viable way? the pause and lack of tracking have made them very 50/50 in pvp for me, do they have purpose in a lightweight build? * smgs: good, bad, niche? do they come in laser or plasma varieties? how do they compare to handguns? * rf linear rifle and assault rifle: they add great stagger and keep pressure on, but is that all they can do or can i truly rely on them for consistent dmg * laser cannon: is it intended to be a weapon against big slow tank treads or does it have any value against lightweight unstaggered ac's? i like it largely because of vile from megaman x so i wanted to know if i could make it work in a light build and what it's role is * fcs: how much of a difference do the close, medium, long assists make? this question also applies for the missile lock correction. what weapons and strategies most benefit from high assist or high correction and what weapons/missiles are least reliant on those stats? * generators: what do i actually \*want\* out of my generator? atm, i've largely been choosing the generators based on how much they benefit my boost speed and suffice my en load needs / qb needs * status effects: are builds oriented around status effects worth a damn? if so, what frames best support that strategy? * melee weapons / double trigger: pros and cons between the two? how varied are the melee weapons? i've largely stuck with good ol starting pulse blade due to it's pulse tech and diagonal swing pattern. are daggers, sabers, and other such things available? i know of the pilebunker and energy lance so far and ofc moonlight greatsword equivalent. last data to provide would be, i *really* like kinetic weapons and energy blades due to my nostalgia from megaman x / megaman zero. so any info you could provide that amps that up would be much obliged. thanks to anyone who provides what scraps of information they can. i need to absorb as much knowledge and analysis as possible because it's both fun (theorycrafting) and i like to opimtize so i can meme harder.",armoredcore,https://www.reddit.com/r/armoredcore/comments/16f6v6c/pvp_help_for_a_newbie/,0

16f6u28,(a/gm4a) lets write together! original ideas and fandoms,"hey there, everyone! i hope you all are having a good day or night, wherever you are in the world right now. you can call me blue if you’d like. two of my favorite pastimes are art and writing. not only do i love to draw and design my own characters, but i love to write my own stories and then make my own casts of characters to fill them up with, bringing life to the worlds i imagine in my head. i love nature and animals and i’m a huge nerd too. i love manga and anime and i’ve just recently started to get more into comic books. if you can tell by the title, i’m looking for a partner to help me write out a story. not just any story though! a story where both of us can kick back and bring our heads together to think of something great. something that both of us would have fun with. but before i get into the details of the story, i think now would be a good time for an info-dump! so, a few important things to know about me: my time zone is est, but i have a very wonky sleep schedule. i definitely tend to stay up later then most people. i don’t have any problems with my partners time zone though! as for writing style, i prefer third person and have no set post-length either. how much i write tends to fluctuate; it really depends on what’s currently going on in the story. i don’t believe that every response warrants a wall of text back. regardless, i like to keep things nice and detailed for my partner. i would never describe myself as advanced lit. or anything like that — i just write for the fun of it. genre’s i tend to write are fantasy, science fiction, romance, historical fiction, alternative history, post-apocalyptic fiction, and just fiction in general. i have a soft spot for wacky characters with crazy powers, so that probably explains my love for crazy fantasy stories, haha. i have a thing for futuristic settings and the steampunk genre too. i’m also a huge sucker for all things cute and wholesome, so i tend to lean towards that when writing romance stories. almost all the romance rp’s i’ve done before have been cutesy slice of life stories. i only rp on reddit chat. sorry to all the dm and discord users out there. while i have a few original story ideas of my own that i’d love to share privately, there are plenty of fandoms that i’m in that i’d love nothing more than to write stories for. while there’s nothing wrong with writing for canon characters, i prefer to play as my own oc’s. i have a plethora of different characters, both male *and* female. now that that’s out of the way — onto the fandoms! the ones i want to do the most will have a little \* next to them. :) \- dragon ball (z, super, & movies) \* \- naruto \- my hero academia \- attack on titan (anime & manga) \- hunter x hunter (anime & manga) \- a certain monster-catching series (games & anime) \* \- tokyo ghoul \* \- one piece \- jojo’s bizarre adventures (anime & manga) \- jujutsu kaisen \- ghibli films \- harry potter \* \- warrior cats (books & graphic novels) \- wings of fire \- twilight (movies) \* \- miss peregrines home for peculiar children \- percy jackson (slightly familiar) \- marvel \- dc \* \- invincible (tv series) \- star wars (movies & comics) \* \- the walking dead (telltale games & tv series) \- the last of us (games) \- god of war \- resident evil (slightly familiar with the games) \- sonic the hedgehog (games & sonic x) \- street fighter \- avatar: the last airbender \* \- ben 10 \* \- steven universe \- transformers (movies) \- alien/predator (movies) \- rise of the planet of the apes (movies) even though i’ve already got plenty of ideas in mind, please don’t let that discourage you from sharing whatever you’ve got on your mind. this is a team effort after all! i want you to remember that ultimately i’m just here for a good time. while we’re coming together to tell a story, my biggest priority will always be that the both of us are having fun. i’m hoping to meet eager writers and fellow fans, and hopefully make a new friend too. i’d love nothing more than to bounce ideas off of each other and nerd out about our favorite things together. please feel free to let me know what you’re thinking and help make the story more enjoyable for yourself; i'm completely fine with hearing you out. if any of this interests you, please don’t be shy and go ahead send me a message! let me know what you liked, what caught your eye, and any ideas you have. let me know about your favorite fandoms and characters while you’re at it too! i’d love to know if we share any. i’m looking forward to hearing from you. take care! :)",Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/16f6u28/agm4a_lets_write_together_original_ideas_and/,0

whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god.""** **john 14:24 kjv** **“he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the father's which sent me.""** **once brothers and sisters/fallen away from sound doctrine** **matthew 18:17 kjv** **“and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell \[it\] unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.""** **\[romans 8:5-8 kjv\]** **""5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. 6 for to be carnally minded \[is\] death; but to be spiritually minded \[is\] life and peace. 7 because the carnal mind \[is\] enmity against god: for it is not subject to the law of god, neither indeed can be. 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god.""** **ourselves** **romans 7:18-20 kjv** **""18 for i know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but \[how\] to perform that which is good i find not. 19 for the good that i would i do not: but the evil which i would not, that i do. 20 now if i do that i would not, it is no more i that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.""** so then, where shall we rejoice? we rejoice in the power and authority in jesus and through jesus that he alone is lord over our lives! that we have victory over our own circumstances that jesus be glorified in all these things! but that when our enemy falls, that we do not rejoice in their fall, rather it be to a circumstance or death. jesus does not want to see any be punished or die, but understand this, his righteousness will stand, his holiness will stand, his word will stand! in that, punishment or death too many are at their own hands of disobedience. even when our enemy comes to a judgment set by jesus that is justified, let us mourn the judgment that did not have to come. the only except to this, deals with satan, in that, let us rejoice that jesus has victory over him in all things! even dealing with the world, the lost, lets us mourn that they never knew jesus as their savior and lord, that their eternity is in the lake of fire! i know many think, many believe, that they are vindicated at the punishment or death of an individual that has done wrong, done evil against us, but it is jesus who must be glorified not in their judgment, but that jesus is lord against those who oppose him and to us that are the true blood bought who walk in obedience! **exodus 23:22 kjv** **“but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that i speak; then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.""** **1 kings 8:33-34 kjv** **""33 when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: 34 then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.""** so then, we know that we have enemies, in which should be equal to jesus, for those who need understanding, those who need clarity, those who are unlearned, understand this, that when the father said that “for god so loved the world…”, he was referring to his creation, in that, that he created he loves, but, when sin entered in to the fathers creation, he hated those who would be disobedient to him. so, long explanation short, jesus came to fix the issue of sin, by his blood, his sacrifice so that we may have a opportunity to repent and accept jesus as our sacrifice for our sins! if, if, if a person does not accept, does not agree in this free gift from the father, they are your enemy. in saying that, “so what about being good to your enemy, your neighbor…?”, this is where most blood bought get mixed up. first lets add a couple of scripture of reference here… **revelation 18:4 kjv** **“and i heard another voice from heaven, saying, come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.""** **isaiah 59:2 kjv** **“but your iniquities have separated between you and your god, and your sins have hid \[his\] face from you, that he will not hear.""** we are to be separated from the worlds sin! we are not to partake in how, what the world is doing that is against jesus! so then again the question, “love your enemies…love your neighbor…”, if an enemy or neighbor needs help, needs supplies, needs…, then if it is within our power to give to their need, we are to do so, but that is where it stops! we can help our enemy, do good to our enemy, but we are not to be friends with the enemy, not be like our enemy. i have neighbors that i would help, give to, in their time of need, but they are not my friends, but are people whom the father and jesus want to save from sin. if again i say if, these people refuse to hear, then unless jesus or the holy spirit lead you to continue to communicate to them, then do not, separate yourself from them. you say show me an example… **matthew 10:13-15 kjv** **""13 and if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 and whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. 15 verily i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.""** nowhere in scripture does it say that you are to become friends with those who will not hear the good news, no where!!! but yet many, many of you have done so. the love is that we have the same love as the father and jesus towards a person to tell them that they need jesus, but if they do not accept, then they are still your enemy that you are not to engage in fellowship with. scriptures tell us that what fellowship does light have with darkness! **2 corinthians 6:14 kjv** **“be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?""** **ephesians 5:11 kjv** **“and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove \[them\].""** **1 john 1:6 kjv** **“if we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:""** again, we have enemies that oppose jesus, they will suffer and even die being the enemies, but let us not rejoice in their suffering or death for it is a sin to do so. let your rejoicing be in jesus and what he has done in your life and the mercy and grace that we have found, not only to ourselves but, even to our enemies the love he has shown! our brother paul speaks of our enemy and how to fight against him, but there is no rejoicing but only in that jesus is lord. **ephesians 6:11-18 kjv** **""11 put on the whole armour of god, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high \[places\]. 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 14 stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 15 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 17 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of god: 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;""** this is how to deal with the enemy with no rejoicing, no friendship… **matthew 5:44-45 kjv** **""44 but i say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.""** **romans 12:20 kjv** **“therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.""** **amen and amen!!!** **email:** [**godsonlyfoundation MENTION **website: apostlelee.com**",u_ApostleLeeWoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ApostleLeeWoo/comments/16f6rbe/rejoice_not_when_your_enemy_falls/,0
16f6rac,make your bed a fortress: my diy plan that instantly fixed my bedbug problem,"sorry for the click-baity title, but i really think this is a pretty well researched diy action plan that can help others fix their bedbug issue quickly, effectively, and much cheaper than professional help. i got a lot of these tips from reddit so wanted to give back and hopefully help a few people deal with this nightmare. **background:** i live in the upper-east coast us in an older apartment. i think when i had some friends visiting from abroad, one of them brought over bedbugs from a hostel they were previously staying. a few weeks later, i started getting big red itchy bites all over me, roughly 2-3 per day for almost a month, easily 50 bites+, i thought they were mosquitos at first, but after sealing up the windows and eventually finding signs of bedbugs, i started freaking out having difficulty sleeping. luckily my gf who was likely also getting bitten, had basically no reaction to bites (tiny red dots if anything) otherwise we likely woulda had to move out asap. i called two professional services, who quoted $1k to $5k all-in, which seemed crazy expensive and wouldn't give me any immediate guarantees or comfort. after 2-3 days of intensive reddit/youtube/a few science journals, i came up with the following action plan. i will note that from research, bedbugs can seem like an unwinnable opponent (read this sub, many people just pick up and move). you need to implement not just a single fix, but a multistep plan to preventing them from feeding on you, killing them longer term, and clearing out remaining eggs. this what i have tried to do and summarize for you below. do more research than just this post, but also remember when you read things like ""x doesn't work, bedbugs will just do y"", remember than every step is just one small fix, that when combined with a dozen other mediocre solutions, will turn your bed into an anti bedbug fortress. if something is cheap (relative to professional help or moving), relatively safe, and easy, you should probably incorporate it into your plan. also remember that a lot of websites run by pest control companies have a vested interest in playing down diy solutions. that said, this here is a handy list of things that don't work: LINK this plan literally fixed my bedbug issue overnight, i haven’t gotten a single bite since 2 months later. you’ll spend around roughly $200 usd as of 2023, a full day of upfront work, and a few hours a week for 2-3 months. **shopping list** all available online, should be able to get most of these at local hardware stores too: * cortizone lotion: best bang for buck product on this list, this anti-itch cream is cheap, will let you focus on solving this problem, and will reduce scarring if you have bad bite symptoms. with this plan you won't need a ton, a small 1% tube will be more than enough ($5) * bed bug interceptors: place 4 of these underneath your bedposts. these alone won't do a lot, but have a few uses as part of this plan, they will trap a small number of bed bugs preventing them from getting to you, whenever this happens they will confirm you still have bugs, and they are useful for containing a small amount of de / cimexa (below) ensuring a small amount is surrounding your bed posts at all times ($20). * glue traps: these are good if you have more than 4 bedposts and don't have enough interceptors, place one of these under any extra posts your bed has to prevent bed bugs from crawling up them. can also leave 1-2 lying around near your bed just in case they trap the odd bug. (10 traps for $10) * packing tape + vaseline: vaseline/petroleum jelly acts as a physical blocker to bedbugs, they have difficulty crossing it. put 1-2 rings of packing tape around your bed posts, then lather on petroleum jelly (1/8th+ inch thick coating, 1inch+ wide). you’ll want ideally 10oz+. the packing tape isn’t 100% necessary but will help protect your bed posts/walls from the jelly if they are wooden/expensive etc. ($10) * bed bug mattress cover: one of these will lock away bugs / eggs inside your mattress, and will make your mattress easier to steam / clean / identify bugs. you’ll need to leave it on tight for at least 6 months, ideally 1 year to guarantee bugs inside fully starve / die ($30) * clothes steamer: pretty much any pricepoint steamer should be fine, i used a little handheld one for $20. key is that it should produce a hot beam of steam, if you can’t stand the heat of it on your hand 6 inches away that’s good enough. an extension cord will be handy too. ($20) * diatomaceous earth (de) + cimexa: these are two relatively safe “dusts” that are hazardous for bugs to touch. if they do touch it, they will cut themselves/eventually get dehydrated/die (though safe for humans to handle, just don't breath it in or get it into your eyes). de is a generic/”natural” product, cimexa is a branded and more effective similar dusty substance. for both of these, buy a small container with some sort of applicator (usually a squeeze bottle). wear an n95 mask to be extra careful when applying, and remember a light coat is key, you should barely be able to see it once applied. more details below on how i used these. (around $20 each, smallest bottle is enough). if you have meddling kids or pets i would use de more than cimexa, but do your own research. * crossfire: this is a bedbug poison that based on my research is very effective + pretty safe to use. it’s useful in this plan because it’s applied like a paint, so can go places like baseboards where de/cimexa can’t as easily be applied. (around $40) * sleeping bag: optional, but if you have a big blanket, you need to make sure it doesn’t touch the ground at night, otherwise bugs can crawl up it. one easy solution is a cheap sleeping bag. you can go back to your old blanket in a few months ($30). **day 1: 4-8h of work** clean out everywhere around your bed, and ideally everything anything in the same room. declutter, sweep/vacuum, mop/wipe up the floor and baseboards. you will be applying some slightly unhealthy products around so won’t be easily able to clean for a few months. take your mattress apart, throw your bedsheets in the dryer first on high for 30min+, then wash and dry again. the heat from the dryer will kill bedbugs and eggs. depending on your dryer, throwing in a wet hand towel to trigger the moisture sensor will ensure it stays on high heat. use the steam cleaner to steam the entire mattress and bedframe all around, go over any seems / nooks and crannies twice to make sure they’re heated through. similar steam any baseboards near your bed. bedbugs can live 20ft away, ideally you steam everything far and wide of your bed too (couches, clothes picture frames, everything!) , and diligently vacuum/mop the floor. you're not just killing bugs, your really trying to kill tiny eggs which are very difficult to see but will die quickly by a second or two of hot steam. this will take a few hours but is well worth it day 1. move your bed 6 inches+ from any wall, and make sure standing lights are 6+ inches away too. bb’s will climb all over anything to get to you. put on your mattress cover, zip it up tight. put the interceptors/glue traps under the bed posts. apply a small amount of cimexa into the middle of the interceptors, and apply a small amount of de / cimexa around the posts on the floor, the floor edges around the room, under your couches, behind dressers, anywhere you aren't walking around. tape up and apply petroleum jelly to the bed posts. unscrew the plates covering any electrical outlets you have, give each one a dusting of cimexa, then rescrew the cover on. if you have any holes in walls or floors, give them a coating of cimexa too, your bb's may be coming from another unit if you live in an apartment. you currently have de+cimexa, some interceptors, and a ring of jelly around your bedposts. any one of these steps probably wouldn’t stop bb’s, but when combined form a killzone for them. the only remaining weakness is your blanket (so use a sleeping bag if you're not certain it'll stay up), and the ceiling, bb’s can climb up and drop down on top of you. this is a bit extreme, but imo worth it. apply a rectangle of tape + petroleum above your bed, at least 6inches wider than your bed in all directions. if bedbugs climb the walls and run into the jelly, if they fall you want to make sure they can’t land on the bed. also with the crossfire poison, follow the instructions on dilution and application, and use something like a cheap paintbrush to apply a coat of crossfire to all the baseboards near your bed, ideally around the whole room. crossfire is apparently safe, but if you're worried about applying this to walls then apply a layer of packing tape, then a layer of masking tape on top, then apply crossfire to the masking tape. the masking tape will hold the crossfire and will make it easy to remove, just pull up the packing tape. **pets/kids/unusual beds** this worked well for me in my living space, but if you have kids/pets, an awkward sleeping room, or a bed without posts (or ability of put it up onto posts), i'm sorry i don't have any great tips for you. guarding the bedposts and applying de/cimexa/crossfire were key for me, i don't know how you can adjust this plan without them. **ongoing work** if you’ve followed this thoroughly, you should immediately see results in fewer bites. your bed / mattress were sanitized, so any bug that somehow got past the petroleum jelly must have crossed some cimexa or cross fire which will likely kill it before it has time to lay eggs. to follow up, if you ever do get bitten you should re-steam your bedframe / mattress /sheets asap, and check your petroleum jelly didn’t get wiped off accidentally. even if you're not bitten do this at weekly for a few weeks. wash through your clothes on high heat. after a month, you should wipe up and reapply de/cimexa esp if you live in a humid environment which will moderately degrade these. at this point you have a fortress bed, are starving them out, and have created a hazardous environment for them to move around. they need to prey on you several times to reproduce, so you may start noticing them during the day try to get to you. they will also take more risks around the interceptors / cimexa. eggs laid earlier will start to hatch, and younger bb’s are more sensitive to the poisons. at this point you just need to keep steaming everything, cleaning clothes on high heat, and periodically reapply your de/cimexa/crossfire, eventually you'll win out. good luck!",Bedbugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/comments/16f6rac/make_your_bed_a_fortress_my_diy_plan_that/,0

(i'm assuming the 7 people she invited at least a few of them will bring their wives/kids) what i had set up does not accommodate that many people (an outdoor movie with little inflatable pools for everyone + movie snacks) so there is quite literally no where for them to sit, you can't just throw down a blanket to watch a movie bc of fire ants in their yard. at this point i'm just frustrated having no help and being expected to pull all the time, money, and resources out of my ass when i signed up to help set up/plan a party. especially when her and her husband are the only people i know that are going to the party, and my husband and i aren't really even planning to stay that long since we both hate being in crowds of loud people and music.",AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f6myv/wibta_if_i_stop_planning_my_bestfriends_birthday/,0

16f6kis,poor work done by contractor,i'm located in south carolina. i had a company come to my house to install a crawl space encapsulation. to sum it up they pretty much didn't do anything to the standards listed in the contract. but a detailed list of stuff they didn't do properly is: -they didn't seal my crawlspace vents -they didn't overlap the vapor barrier 1 foot stated in contract -they didn't install weather stripping on the entrance doors -they didn't remove the old vapor barrier -they didn't grade my crawlspace floor -they damaged one of my cinder block colums supporting the house -they didn't seal the gap around the skirting of my house -i believes they didn't install the french drain properly due to water still pooling on that side of the house -the discharge line ran is not water tight so it's leaking in the ground. -they installed about 100sqft of foam board insulation out of 231sqft and 40 out 50 ft of french drain -the foam board insulation that was installed was done so in a manner that voids the manufacturers warranty. i've been in contact with them trying to get this resolved but it's been super frustrating because pretty much every concern the project manager just keeps trying to invalidate. for example when i found out the old vapor barrier was still down there he kept trying to tell me that it was fine they do it all the time. ive already had a company come out and give me a letter of things that are wrong. ive been trying to figure out how to remedy this situation. in regard to the column they haven't been back on site to visually inspect it so i'm still waiting on that. is it unreasonable to ask them to remove materials down to the other fasteners used so i can visually inspect wether the other colums are damaged? the way the contract is written it that there is no other warranties than what is written in the contract and the only warranty that is stated about the foam is a manufacturers warranty but the project manager keeps telling me that they warranty it so my plan is to tell them to add an addendum to the contract to clearly state that or replace the foam and install it according to the manufacturers guidelines. with the current state of things i have a gut feeling that this is going to go to arbitration. so i'd like any advice that i can get so that if i have to get a lawyer i'm as prepared as possible and make it easier on the lawyer. also i'm curious on wether or not i have grounds to fire the contractor under breach of contract yet due to the inadequate standards of their install? also what ensues after someone fires a contractor?,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/16f6kis/poor_work_done_by_contractor/,0

16f6i40,ozone depletion: the major issue," the term ""ozone hole"" refers to a region of depleted ozone in the stratosphere, not a hole where no ozone is really present. when there is chlorine present in the atmosphere, it causes ozone in the ozone layer to be destroyed. high concentrations of chemicals containing chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere are the root cause of this issue. because of this, the globe is currently experiencing an environmental catastrophe; this is a very serious problem for us and the entire planet. [ozone depletion]( LINK refers to the thinning of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere; some chemical compounds produce chlorine and bromine during this process. the international day for the preservation of nature was established on september 16 by the united nations general assembly in 1994. high concentrations of chlorine and bromine chemicals in the stratosphere are the main culprits behind the issue of ozone layer depletion. cfc, which is used as a cooling agent in air conditioners and freezers, as well as aerosol propellants and bromofluorocarbons (halons), which are used in fire extinguishers, are the sources of these chemicals. human health, animal health, the environment, and marine life are all impacted by ozone layer depletion. strong uv radiation may prevent plants from growing, blooming, or performing photosynthesis. for more information please visit our homepage [mustvvisit]( LINK it often happens when the stratospheric ozone's natural production and destruction ratios are upset. the ozone layer is also weakened by global warming. since the troposphere needs maximal sunshine and heat for ozone layer recovery, ozone is present in the stratosphere, preventing heat from reaching it. the main damaging concern currently facing the world is the ongoing destruction of the ozone layer. the main culprit in the destruction of the ozone layer is chlorofluorocarbons. in order for us to protect ourselves from the negative effects of ultraviolet radiation in the future, these compounds should either be prohibited or replaced with safer alternatives. the montreal protocol is a global agreement that forbade the use of substances that contained ozone depleting chemicals and phased out the manufacture of a number of substances thought to be the cause of [ozone depletion]( LINK since the ozone layer shields the earth's atmosphere from the majority of dangerous ultraviolet light wavelengths, its loss has raised alarm among environmentalists all over the world. the ""montreal protocol"" was eventually adopted as a result.",u_muskan06singh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_muskan06singh/comments/16f6i40/ozone_depletion_the_major_issue/,0

is why it took so long. speaking of taking long, today’s comment has some info about my forecasted schedule.* *fun fact: tim’s name is the product of me asking myself what the absolute stupidest name for an alien would be and then violently bashing the lore with a stick until it worked.* *i’m probably the only one who finds it amusing, but by god, i still do think it’s funny.* in the oort cloud of the mesik system, home to and named with creative bankruptcy after the planet, mesik, the final ship of an exploration fleet died approximately twenty minutes ago. it was killed by an inert kinetic penetrator fired from the self-piloting superdreadnought to reach out and touch. though hardly differentiable from something a stone-age civilization might pursue, the technology propelling it was not. perversely, it was the summative, devastating might of a long-decayed golden-age civilization, potently expressed through the intricate collaboration of metamaterial gravitic accelerators, conventional chemical propellants, and magnetic rail systems whose sole purpose was to throw railroad car-sized lengths of iron towards unpleasant things at stupid speeds. the silencing of the scouting ship’s engines did not go unnoticed by a nearby early warning satellite. though constructed by the same reigning polity, the probe’s inner workings were far, far older than the to reach out and touch, as suggested by its anachronistic use of subspace communications to broadcast an all-clear signal. receiving the stand-down order, a monolithic artillery piece on the surface of mesik began the slow, shuddering process of returning its barrel to a resting position. like the satellite to the warship, anti-orbital ground battery 8310, too, represented an earlier era of technological complexity, deriving its lineage from the same autonomous emplacements that defined, and concluded, the fifteenth terran world war. not wanting to be one-upped, the locals, to whom the emplacement was called old faithful, then proceeded to communicate its movement through the primitive medium of analog radio. by the time this chain of events reached the office of a certain dr. aus-lamn-katt, it was being relayed by a message runner: hardly differentiable from something a stone-age civilization might pursue. dr. aus-lamn-katt is not having a good day. he was not having a good day when the ancient, unstable precursor gun towering over his office spontaneously started aiming at the sky. he was not having a good day when he witnessed the total and complete destruction of the aforementioned exploration fleet, involving more firepower unleashed in thirty seconds than his entire species fielded in the last century. nor was he having a good day when he was reminded of the fact that around two hundred and fifty of his employees are scheduled to invariably cross the ancient warship’s field of fire later today. fifteen seconds ago, dr. aus-lamn-katt was really just going through it when his conference was barged into by a panting and sweaty communications coordinator. nonetheless, the stubborn little caprid maintains a composed demeanor. he’s on a video conference with both the head of state and the chair of civil defense, after all, and can’t afford another loss of face. **name: aus-lamn-kattspecies: shish-hash-ait (caprine, taurid species)occupation: lead researcher, ibsac lowlands republic branch** the door to my office shuts, and i sigh, turning my attention to the figure dominating my workstation screen. “once again, i’m terribly sorry about that, mrs. *sce-til-telv*,” i apologize. in a normal conversation, the three-beat word’s literal meaning was “high-soaring bird” but its use as a title referred to the democratically elected leader of the republic. she waves an excusing hand. “oh, that’s just how it is, being a leader. we’re nothing without our traditions, you know.” the incumbent stateswoman, a reservational in her second term, is young for a politician, though well presented. she’s wearing a four-piece set of tessellated, drab formalwear, and the way she almost completely fills her frame that she’s trying to project an image of matriarchal dominance. women were, on average, a head and a half taller—that was just sexual dimorphism—but the not-so-subtle angling of her camera is a political statement. i don’t like her, i didn’t like her campaign, and on the few prior occasions that we had come face-to-face during official meetings, i actively avoided her presence. she picks up on my continued silence as a signal to the fact that i’m not quite yet back in the conversation. “you were telling me about a ship or something, weren’t you?” she asks. i give her a well-rehearsed, exceedingly fake smile. yes. i was. a particular heavily armed, openly violent alien “ship or something” of alien make that just so happened to be squatting between mesik and just over two hundred of my employees. a ship or something. give me a break. “indeed, i was, ma’am,” i chirp. “i have my call centers backed up distributing emergency orders to my further employees with instructions to stay put until the situation progresses. the craft is about four light-hours away, so we’re unsure what it’s doing at this exact moment, but-” the *sce-til-telv* inhales, and i stop so as not to talk over her. “what do you mean you don’t know what it’s doing? you’re pointing sensors at it, right?” i have to bite the inside of my cheek in order not to bare my teeth at her as i attempt to formulate a suitably civil response. “we are, ma’am. i can’t control how fast light travels.” “oh, i’m just commenting, is all,” she concedes. “i expected that your sensors would be faster with how much funding you get.” i ignore the jab—face was everything in republic politics, and i’m about to lose mine by engaging her—and instead glance towards the chair of civil defense, who’d abandoned me to fend for myself against the politician. she, too, gets an artificially saccharine smile. “what are your thoughts on the matter, chairwoman wau-sae-tetzil?” unlike the *sce-til-telv*, whose image was carefully curated, the defense chair didn’t seem to care who she came off. most of her video feed was of the ceiling, with the chair residing in the lower half, head cupped in her hands. she wears a simple black button-up, and the loose, shaggy curls of her wool, a characteristic of the northern regions, spill up from under her collar. also unlike the *sce-til-telv*, tetzil and i were close acquaintances. towards the end of my conscription, we were in the same squad, and we shared the solidarity that came with seeing active combat together. our careers had since gone separate ways, only recently convening on the republic’s political stage, but we still maintained a close relationship. close enough that i could say, without a shadow of doubt, her abstinence from the conversation was completely uncharacteristic. tetzil wasn’t one to let a conversation progress without a firm monopoly on its topic, but here she is, flicking her ears in passive ambiguity. “seems like a large-scale repeat of the moxie incident,” comes the simple, matter-of-fact comment. the moxie incident—the name was familiar, but frustratingly, i find myself unable to pin down exactly what the moxie incident was. i don’t get very far into wracking my mind in pursuit of an answer before the head of state saves me the trouble. “moxie incident? what’s that?” “old mishap from the early days of ibsac,” she starts, and at once, i’m reminded of the details. “a salvage team was sent to retrieve a pair of dormant type 1 and type 2 warships that had been tangled together. when they passed the fifty kau-xinn mark, both crafts powered up and started discharging their weapons. one of their reactors went critical, suffering the mission a total asset loss.” i chuff in agreement with the assessment. modern doctrine referred to it as i32ldv, hence my confusion, but nobody except for me cared about that sort of thing. incident 32, lethal, destructive, vehicular was one of the stronger anecdotes supporting the fact that both types of precursor vessels belonged to the same civilization and the driving force behind many of today’s safety protocols. the connection was plain, with dormant archeotech activating and going haywire, but i noticed a discrepancy in the direct comparison. “in the incident in question, both crafts were present in the system for quite some time without issue. that doesn’t seem to be the case here,“ i object. “the large vessel, to reach out and touch, seems to be here in response to the signal triggered by the advent of the smaller ones.” tetzil catches on. “we do have footage of the warship appearing in-system shortly after the signal,” she concurs. “the fleet, however, first showed up on my instruments seven days ago. we planned to notify your channels by the end of next week, but only today did the local archeotech start displaying any hostility to it.” concerning. “and who’s to blame for disrupting things?” the *sce-til-telv* demands. “didn’t they know that doing so would result in the destruction of government property?” “mrs. *sce-til-telv*,” i start, “if i may. the chairwoman can correct me if i’m wrong, but the allusion here is that something other than ourselves may have been the intervening party.” “and who might they be? do you have names, lead researcher?” i repress a sigh. “i doubt the party is going to come by and say hello.” it’s going to be a long conference. **name: mau-aff-timspecies: shish-hash-aitoccupation: ibsac intern (underpaid)** i stare at the alien that just came by to say hello. it stares back at me. at least, i think she does. (i’m assuming the alien is a she, since it’s bigger than me and has no horns, which are both feminine traits. (if i’m wrong, sue me or something.)) i can’t actually see her face beneath the copper-hued visor on her helmeted head. the thing’s whole body is obscured by the bulk of a gray-and-teal eva suit, betraying only a simple body plan and four long, multi-jointed arms that coil in on themselves to fit in the cramped interior. i expected her to say a lot of things to me: threats, demands for concessions, and accusations of duplicity, all of which would have been fair. though not actively, i did lead her to believe that we were of the same species. nothing could have prepared me for the four words, delivered in the vehicle of an offhand comment, that the translation console had just read aloud. “i’m sorry, can you repeat that?” i ask. **name: cas sellivimspecies: spacer (human derivative, extreme modifications for interstellar conditions)occupation: freelancer** “i said, “‘it’s radioactive in here.” as in, the materials this ship is made of have been mildly contaminated by neutron radiation.” i stare at them, and they wander their four brown eyes over areas of my faceplate as they try, and fail, to return eye contact. their entire nude(???) body seems to be covered in a coat of tightly curled wool, and on their head are four eyes, a pair of perky, leaf-shaped ears, and the daggerlike, conical points of two horns. they stand on a quartet of legs bearing the characteristic stubbiness universal to life accustomed to the influence of a gravity well, and they rest their arms loosely, level with the foremost hip. in a funny sort of way, they looked like one of the heirloom animals humans would keep around—the horns, wool, and hooves especially—but the topic isn’t one i know enough about to confidently associate a name to, and i’m not about to embarrass myself by bringing it up and getting the species wrong. cats? maybe they’re cats? my chief engineer always used to say something about herding them, which would make sense for a prey animal. whatever. they seem completely captivated by my presence, a contrast to the detached curiosity i felt towards their subspecies. it was no different from how i felt when i met my first human. and asp. and shipmind. and athenan. and uplift. and hydroform. and cosmetic gene-mod, even if i found out they were just an oddly shaped human. the novelty really did wear off after the fourth subspecies. … … the prolonged silence has started to get uncomfortable, and i take it upon myself to break it. “that’s what you meant when you said you had something to admit, right?” the look i get tells me it isn’t. “no,” they begin, speaking in their odd, regional dialect as a raw data signal translates the words, “i lied earlier. my ship isn’t actually broken, and i’m not one of whatever you are.” “yeah,” i nod, unsure why the obvious was being stated, “subspecies.” “no. aliens.” i’m not so convinced. “okay, but how do you know?” they start to say something in their unusual, rhythmic regional dialect, then stop, then start again, exasperated. i really don’t see what the big deal is. “how many eyes do you have under that helmet?” “two.” “yeah, two eyes and four limbs isn’t normal where i’m from. you’re just an alien.” i don’t see how that proves anything. “well,” i counter, “my old captain had no limbs, no eyes, no bones, and no organs, but we were related.” a series of unreadable expressions crosses my host’s face. they murmur something that the console doesn’t pick up before speaking up. “fucking what?” it was true: my old ship, the idyllic everheart, was helmed by a seventh-generation shipmind. finding out you shared a superspecies with a two-meter-wide mass of neutral tissue tended to put things in perspective, but my host nonetheless seems adamant that we share no common genetic history. at this point, pushing any further would be impolite. “i think we’re getting off-topic here,” i concede. “you said your ship was in working order, right?” “it is, yeah,” they admit. i nod in approval. samaritan laws bound me to offer assistance to stranded ships, which is why i bothered paying this visit in the first place, but my host both didn’t seem to want me here and clearly stated nothing was broken, so i had no further obligation to intrude. “in that case, i’ll be on my way. you can stay here, since you don’t seem to understand that this is a mining sector, but try not to interrupt me.” “you’re leaving?” they object. “aren’t we supposed to exchange names and gifts or something?” i tilt my head. “are we?” i really don’t know why i’m being asked this, but the poor thing seems to be in a constant state of confusion. maybe they do need my assistance, ship functionality aside. “no,” they admit. “yes. i don’t know. i’m tim.” that is the single least exotic-sounding name i’ve ever heard in my life. of course, i don’t bring that up, since it would be rude. “my name’s cas.” i search my tool rig for something to satisfy their odd request. “do you want some radio components?” name: mau-aff-tim species: shish-hash-ait occupation: ibsac intern (underpaid) i glance at the wrapped, angular items in the alien’s hands. i don’t want the xeno radio components. i don’t want to be talking to cas, either. this conversation is impossible. i mean, i’m still caught up on what a limbless, eyeless, organless lifeform looks like. how could one become captain? why does something like that *exist*? “thanks,” i manage, hesitantly accepting the package. i turn to put them on a far surface of the console, and as i do, my gaze catches over the “emergency communication” option on the console screen. awkward conversation was an emergency, right? okay, no, it really wasn’t, but meeting an alien hopefully probably was. the one thing they made clear during the study initiation was that we’d get bodied, legally and vocationally, if we fucked up the study’s data by breaking communications silence. gossip for the five minutes i’d been with the other interns had word that that the lead researcher was also a real cutthroat when it came to fuckups. *hopefully probably*. i hit confirm, and a dial tone soon begins to play as the ship establishes a subspace connection. the screen switches to a preview of the console’s camera, showing myself, of course… and the towering, suited figure that looms behind me, who is peering over my shoulder with a curious interest. probably can’t have that during the call. “what’re you doing?” it asks. *definitely* can’t have that during the call. “i, uhh, i’m…” i stutter, fumbling over my words. i couldn’t just let the alien know what’s going on, since there was no way that would go over well, but i’m even worse at lying than i was at telling the truth. “cas,” i start, attempting a different approach. i pick up my pda and pace to the other ship, where the only other room is located. the alien obliges, shuffling along after me.“i need you to wait in this room and not come out of it for a minute.” they give me a prolonged stare that i really hope isn’t incredulous before finally speaking. “sure thing, whatever. have fun on the call,” comes the quiet, distant reply. “thanks!” i beam, barely hearing what the alien just said. it was funny—i’d sort of forgotten that the text-to-speech wasn’t cas’ actual voice. a chime from the other room draws my attention, and i drop what i’m holding to bolt to the console. as i get closer, i start to make out the shape of a popup dominating the screen: “all operators are currently busy! would you like to be bumped to the next available supervisor?” weird. i guess the call centers were busy today for some reason. whatever, not my problem. i press yes. the dial tone starts for half a second, then stops again, and the message re-displays itself. i mash the “yes” button this time. the process repeats. fuckin’ computers, man. i spam my way through the dialogue until the popup recedes, leaving only the passive “dialing” screen. **mesik.yei-ash-kaut national research park, southern lowlands republic.lead researcher’s office, present moment.** dr. aus-lamn-katt stops mid-sentence as he is interrupted mid-speech in front of the sce-til-telv and the chair of civil defense of the republic. ***again.*** the cheerful notification tone of an unfamiliar commlink address requesting to join the conference scatters his thoughts. three of his eyelids twitch, as, for an ephemeral instant, his composed demeanor gives way to the roiling irritation underneath. dr. aus-lamn-katt briefly considers whether or not it’d be worth it to walk into the wilderness surrounding the research park and just never come back. not today, he warily surmises. katt sighs, takes off his round, silver-rimmed glasses, polishes them on the lapel of his labcoat, and accepts the comm request before re-donning them. if there was a situation short of importance to a fucking alien on the other side of the screen, he swears to himself, someone was going to die for this. having long since adopted a jaded cynicism, he doesn't doubt that it's something menial. # next.",HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16f6i1q/humans_are_the_precursors_children_of_the_stars_3/,0

&#x200b; the only time he and his brother got a taste of the fresh sweet-meat of man or even elf was when adventurers would show up in an effort to cull the trolls that followed them like a swarm of gnats! always pestering them and bothering them when they tried to sleep in peace! &#x200b; yet no matter how many were killed by flaming arrow, burning sword, or even magical fire, more would flock to ed-gar. like some pseudo god they would worship and fear them. they would eat the trolls and be done with them if not for the fact that eating troll meat while it was still alive and wriggling was a poor, and painful, way to die. &#x200b; so the only time they could get any tasty treats was when the trolls would drive people towards their cave where they would then snack on their flesh before the trolls could get to them, or when ed-gar went out hunting themselves. if they were lucky they would come across a hamlet fat with sheep, swine, and man-flesh. &#x200b; but it was almost always adventurers that they would encounter. that was actually how ed-gar got to this new world. a particularly stubborn group had managed to cut their way to their cave and were actually doing well in fighting them. but as the trolls began to pour in and it looked like they would meet a grisly end. a golden portal appeared and offered them sanctuary. &#x200b; which they never saw as ed-gar and the trolls pounced on them while they were distracted. one of their number, some kind of catfish person, managed to enter the, rather unstable looking, portal while his friends were being torn apart. &#x200b; naturally the trolls and ettin chased him through. the portal didn't care for that and struggled to both aid the fishkin and kick out the ettin and trolls. but then they found themselves in a new world that looked similar to their old one. cold weather, hills and mountains. more trees than before but the ettin didn't care. &#x200b; the fishkin, ettin, and the trolls poured out the portal. a few hundred trolls managed to squeeze through after them before the whatever force or nature controlled the portal slammed shut. keeping the rest of the troll horde behind. &#x200b; ed-gar wasn't sure about the nature of the portal as they fought over the fishkin with each other. but at least it meant less trolls to bother them now. they searched and found a cave not far from where they had left the portal where the ettin claimed its new home and rested. &#x200b; but of course the trolls wouldn't leave it be as not long after, a day maybe two, did they hear and smell something on the wind and went to check it out. of course the stone trolls were too dumb to relay anything important other than they found someone. &#x200b; so a group of trolls went back and followed the scent of the ogres and goblins that had fled. from there they encountered a place that smelled of goblins, ogres, and humans. &#x200b; then they got beaten, ran back, bothered the ettin who now found itself salivating over tasting man-flesh once again as it lumbered in the middle of the army of trolls that followed and pestered them constantly. &#x200b; ed-gar pushed and nudged the trees in its way. while the trees were taller than the some 15ft tall ettin was, they weren't as thick and required little effort to move or even break them if they so desired. &#x200b; as they neared where the former battle occurred, the trolls rushed ahead with roars and guttural battle cries. ed-gar quickened their pace and left the now dark woods as the dreary day became gloomy night. as they did, they spotted a large green lake that bubbled ominously between them and a large army of strangely dressed goblins. &#x200b; on the other side ed-gar could see goblins, what looked like a cross of a goblin and a human, something that looked like a human but smelled of goblin, two ogres, and a single human that stood on a raised platform, dressed in fine clothes that glinted and gleamed with fine metals in torch-light as he stared at the trolls and the ettin from the other side. &#x200b; the trolls hobbled towards the lake, but stopped as freshly spawned goblins pulled themselves out of it and charged in a manic frenzy towards the trolls. they were simple to swipe aside, stomp, or even just outright eat. but the thought that the lake was a large spawning pool caused even the dumbest of trolls to pause and consider their actions. &#x200b; taking a dip in a goblin spawning pool was another painful fate, ed-gar thought. there was no telling if you would just be dissolved and used as food within the pool, or if you would be transformed as the pool broke down and remade you piece by piece. &#x200b; the simple, and rickety, footbridge wasn't big enough for the trolls to attempt to cross. so they went around the 40-50 yard wide lake. but they wouldn't go unhindered. with a boom, something came flying towards the ettin at great speed. gar raised a hand in an effort to catch the strange thing, and howled with rage as the cannonball shattered his hand! &#x200b; he glared from his limp and useless hand to where the cannon sat while ed snickered at his brother's misfortune. ed used their right, and stronger, arm to pull and tear free a nearby tree and roared as he swung the tree back, carving a swath through the trolls nearby, before hurling the tree towards the cannon! &#x200b; goblins screamed as the tree sailed towards them and made to move. some were fortunate and got out of the way in time, others found themselves turned to paste as the tree carved through them. but the cannon remained, and fired yet another iron ball towards the ettin. &#x200b; they weren't foolish enough to try and catch it a second time and instead ducked out of the way of its path. the ball sailed harmlessly beside it, and into a couple trees and a line of trolls. but ed-gar didn't care. what mattered was making the human pay for harming it so! &#x200b; the ettin lumbered off to the right, crashing through the trolls with reckless abandon. as they neared the halfway mark past the lake though, they felt something strange. something slick and sticky. &#x200b; they looked down to where the dirt and grass had gone from green to a pitch black. the ettin looked up and saw a strange metal tube with a lick of flame at the end rolled forwards on rickety wheels. it had a large metal tank behind it from where a goblin began to pump away on a handle and ed-gar wasn't sure what it was supposed to do. &#x200b; then fire spewed forth. &#x200b; the blazing line sailed through the air towards them. ed-gar rushed forwards and under the flame. they didn't know what the black stuff underfoot was, but they didn't want to be in it when they found out. &#x200b; the ettin skidded through dirt just as the flame touched the black liquid. ed-gar watched with a healthy measure of fear as black dirt and grass roared to life and engulfed the slow and clumsy trolls! dozens died in burning agony as they tried desperately to put themselves out. some even threw themselves into the spawning pool in an effort to quell the flames. ""stooped trollen."" the ettin cursed. &#x200b; ed-gar turned towards the other side of the lake and saw the same. slick black dirt and grass being turned into a sea of flame that consumed the trolls like a hungry beast. &#x200b; ed-gar roared as burning flame licked at their feet and back! they turned to where the contraption was aimed at them and spewed its flame! while the ettin's skin was thick and tough. it too would burn and scorch if they didn't halt the flamespewer. &#x200b; so with a growl they kicked off the ground and barreled towards the device. the goblin crew scattering as the ettin swiped its right hand. the contraption now laid in pieces strewn about as did many of the goblins nearby. ed-gar turned towards the trolls that had made it past the black liquid before the flames closed their passage back. &#x200b; they were charging towards the goblins with feral roars. the goblins cracked volley after volley of musket fire as they slowly retreated away from the trolls. fire, retreat, fire, retreat. the trolls still on the other side of the spawning lake couldn't decide whether to try and cross or to find a longer, though safer, route to the battle. &#x200b; ed-gar didn't understand why the goblins haven't broken yet. they should be breaking and fleeing before the trolls! yet it looked like they were just buying time. but for what, the ettin thought. &#x200b; then the ettin saw them. goblins covered in black and had a large cumbersome tank on their back and held a metal rod or pipe that connected to the tank with a tube. then the ettin watched once again as flame poured forth from the goblins and engulfed the trolls as they advanced in rage and frustration right into the inferno. &#x200b; ed-gar glanced up at the human who was barking relaying orders to the strange humanlike goblins, who then barked them to the goblins themselves. ""hooman!"" &#x200b; the human glanced up as the ettin called out. the two ogres quickly blocked ed-gar's view of the sweet-meat that was proving to be an annoyance that needed to die first! the only thing the trolls were good for was overwhelming armies as they crashed into their lines and forced them to break off into a desperate melee! but now they were being burned and scorched so even their regeneration couldn't help them now! &#x200b; but if he could kill the human giving the orders, then the goblins will crumble soon after. &#x200b; so ed-gar rushed away from the pile of scraps even as the black liquid still clung to their dirty hide. the cannon was brought around to bear on them. they made to duck under another ball. but ed-gar found themselves blown onto their back as something it their chest! &#x200b; they looked down at the peppering of shot that had hit them. the cannon hadn't fired a single ball but dozens. while it didn't pierce their hide enough to seriously harm or even kill them, it was like being hit in the gut. &#x200b; the ettin was really starting to dislike the human and his contraptions. ed-gar rolled out the way as another scattershot blasted away at the ground where they were. they rushed and jumped over the goblin line and trolls to where they had saw the human. their bulk crashed into the pavilion with a rumble. &#x200b; they looked down in salivation as they picked through what was left. but they couldn't find the remains of the human or the ogres. instead they found a few shattered barrels that flowed a thick black viscous liquid with vapors that burned their noses and stuck like sap to their feet and hands. &#x200b; the ettin looked up as a whistle pierced the night. &#x200b; he saw the human nearby. his clothes a little ruffled from where the ogres had quickly taken him away and a little pale and out of breath. in his hand though held a strange metal thing. with a flick of his thumb a flame sparked into existence. &#x200b; then he threw it into the black liquid. &#x200b; \----- &#x200b; morty wanted to say something awesome and badass as the flame erupted and burned at the legs and hands of the giant whatever-the-sisters-had-called-it. eaten? atein? whatever it was sure burned good! &#x200b; which made morty glad because his plan did not work at all!!! &#x200b; for one thing. the flamethrowers didn't work when they should've! alot of trolls got past the oil slick before they managed to start working in time to fry them. then the two headed thing also managed to avoid getting, mostly, roasted! which was about as bad as when it tanked a cannonball! &#x200b; as the trolls had rushed their front line, the soldiers lent to him by the nobles had turned tail and ran! the cowards! they were supposed to be sacrificed in glorious combat so he could puppet the nobles! &#x200b; the only good thing that happened was that the noble goblin leader had taken the liberty to outfit some goblins in leather and strap a couple tanks of oil to their backs, turning them into his very own flammenwerfer unit! which he totally thought of and would absolutely take credit for if asked. &#x200b; then the damn giant whatcha-call-it took out one of his flamethrowers! the cannon crew were rushed and fired the grapeshot they had ready for the trolls when they got close. good news? it managed to knock it flat on its ass. bad? it didn't kill it. &#x200b; it got back up and glared at morty before charging and ***jumping at him!*** the sisters managed to get him away in time before the thing obliterated his command post! at least it smashed the barrels of reserve napalm they had made, morty thought. &#x200b; all in all, he wasn't sure how this had all somehow worked in his favor, but it did and he was going to sell it like he stole it! &#x200b; he put on a smug face as the thing howled and cried as the napalm burned away its hide, which smelled worse than the trolls and the only reason he wasn't passed out in his own vomit was because he had nose plugs in, which didn't really do much, especially when his sense of smell was assaulted by the burning smell of what amounted to b.o., hot garbage, and rotten meat. &#x200b; the thing tried to put it out somehow but only managed to spread the sticky substance over its body more. eventually the flames did die. but by then the hulking thing looked little better than beef jerky. it growled and spat at morty as he sauntered towards the twitchy burnt thing. &#x200b; the trolls either routed and fled or stayed and watched what would become of their leader depending on which side of the lake they were on. the creature glared as he neared. ""damnen hooman! cursed flammen! stooped trollen!"" &#x200b; ""that's right! i beat you! so i claim your army as mine by right of battle!"" &#x200b; ""bah! stooped hooman! not minen!"" the right, and more angry looking, head cursed at morty. &#x200b; ""what do you mean not yours?! they follow you lead!"" &#x200b; ""bah!"" the creature's left head spat. &#x200b; ""dumb trollen! no lead-ed! only follow-ed! like-ed flies dey pester un annoyen us!"" &#x200b; ""well if you don't lead them then who does so i can beat them?!"" &#x200b; ""stooped hooman! no lead-ed trollen! trollen too dumb to lead-ed!"" &#x200b; ""well... what about you then?"" morty asked. to the shock of the ogres and the creature both. &#x200b; ""what?! mortimer you can't trust an ettin!"" orga hissed. he was actually caught off guard when she used his full name! &#x200b; ""they are untrustworthy! they barely get along with their own other head! it would be better to just kill it and be done with it!"" urga echoed her sister. &#x200b; they have good points, morty thought. but the idea of a hulking creature like that working for him was something he wasn't about to pass up! plus, having it under his control would mean the trolls too! he could see it now! the giant thing-a-ma-jig clearing whole swaths of forest for him! trolls in his army taking whole depots of bullets and walking it off like it was nothing! it was simply too good to pass up! &#x200b; the dilly-whopper grumbled to itself, or maybe one another morty wasn't sure, for a minute. then it grumbled some more and bowed its two heads. ""we will serve-ed."" &#x200b; ""good! first order of buis-"" morty began to say as he raised his arm in a victorious gesture when a loud bang sounded off to his right. &#x200b; he could hear the bullet rush through the air and saw as it pierced the skull of the right head. the left cried out in anguish as its entire right-side went limp even as blood and liquefied brain oozed out of the lolled head. ""broodur!"" &#x200b; it sobbed and turned towards morty with a hateful, and surprisingly tearful, glare. ""trick-ed hooman! you die!"" &#x200b; just as it made to lunge at morty, uncaring for the state of its still shattered hand, a second bang was heard and the remaining head flew back as the damn high caliber bullet punched right through the thick skull. morty and the ogres just stared dumbstruck at what just happened. he looked up at the scared shitless trolls, in some cases literally as piles of troll shit now littered the ground in many places. arm still raised he didn't even get a word out before the trolls turned tail and ran! &#x200b; some were so scared that they chose to run through the still burning oil slicks even as the flame engulfed them. others jumped into the spawning lake. yet more took the chance and rushed towards the goblins in fear, only to be set ablaze by the goblin flamethrowers. some did manage to slip off to the sides where it was clear of anything serious to stop them. &#x200b; within a couple minutes, his dreams of a whatcha-ma-call-it clearing forests and trolls acting as living bullet sponges raced off into the night or to their own deaths. ""well... fuck."" &#x200b; \----- &#x200b; several miles away. &#x200b; a black-glad agent looked down the scope of his anti-material rifle at the dead corpse of the ettin. his radio crackled to life. ""so how did it handle?"" &#x200b; ""curves to the left."" &#x200b; ""we can fix that. think it can take on that giant if it had to?"" &#x200b; ""not sure about that big fella. but i'll bet it wouldn't tickle."" &#x200b; ""great! pack up and report in for official debrief!"" &#x200b; ""copy."" the agent responded before packing up the amr and heading back to the mobile unit. &#x200b; agent mason leaned back in his seat back in the command van as he placed his hands behind his head. ""well, we can call this a success ladies and gents!"" &#x200b; his team cheered as mason smiled. ""kept some seriously dangerous creatures out of the duval's hands while also taking the head off the snake of a serious threat, had a successful field test, and all with minimal exposure!"" &#x200b; his team cheered again before going back to monitoring the estate. sure the duval will more than likely assume it was them. but *assuming* is different than *knowing* is what hq is always saying. he should probably call them and tell them that the trolls have scattered into the wild and should take precautions. the lab rats should enjoy getting a couple of guinea pigs they can experiment with! &#x200b; he grabbed his warm half-eaten burger from nearby and munched down as he flipped his monitor to a baseball game. eh, he'll write the report when his field team gets back for debrief. their accounts will look better on the report. make it more ""professional"". besides, the game is on and his burger and fries are getting cold. &#x200b; [\[first\]]( LINK [\[prev\]]( LINK \[next\]",HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16f6e99/summoning_kobolds_at_midnight_a_tale_of_suburbia/,0

16f6e08,"user is asked to stop using transphobic language, chaos ensues (the story of tiger, the venting channel monopolizer)","i run a fairly large rp hub that has a 'hot topics' channel that is for things that might be charged that other users might not want to read. not even for arguing, just for discussing things like the news or when someone got fired from their job so people can choose if they have the spoons for the discussion or if they'd rather stay in genchat. well. we have one user that's been using the venting channel quite a lot. we'll call them tiger. the user frequently vents about issues affecting impoverished communities before going to boast about their stock portfolio gains in genchat which has honestly always been rather confusing. anyway this goes on for awhile. we don't do anything because they're annoying but they're not causing any harm and we think if people don't want to read their vents they can just...not read them. that's what the venting channel is for and if they wanna talk to themselves in there it's not bothering anyone. until today. another one of our users comes in, we'll call them leaf, to vent about people using the word 'biological' in ads when referring to peoples' gender and how it bothers them. leaf talks about how it feels othering. the mod team is in the discussion, it's all very civil, this is something that's already kind of against our policies anyway but we discover we missed an ad and correct it. (to clarify, leaf wasn't complaining about the ad, just in general, and we happened to discover it at the same time). tiger starts ranting about how impoverished people shouldn't be expected to keep up with language. i point out that tiger has no idea of the background of anyone on the mod team and that we are in a space where the rules are laid out, you had to read them to get in, and resources are readily available. we never berate anyone for making a mistake, especially in public. we have a lot of users from outside the us as well. when someone makes a mistake, we ask them to correct it and it's only a problem if they're obviously resistant when asked not to be a transphobe or if they do it repeatedly after we've asked them to stop. tiger goes off. how having expectations that users don't use transphobic language is hurtful to poor communities. how the mod team is rich and sheltered with lots of disposable time and income so we can't possibly get it and are just classist. she accuses the mod team of being a bunch of white saviors. then she flounces. but not before sending the moderator of another rp resource a long-winded message about how the mod team in my server is a bunch of white savior racists that don't respect poor people. she also accused us of saying the black community needed to 'get with the times' in regards to lgbt issues...something that has actually never come up before in discussion. plot twist...the person running that resource is a mod in the server i run. they saw it, screenshotted it, sent it to us, and we all had a good laugh. tiger replies and says she knows, she just wanted a screenshot of that mod 'refusing to remove a classist server from their list' and then says not to contact her again and if they do she'll report them to reddit/discord. because the block button is insufficient i guess. oh, then she said we were nazis. anyway guess we're a bunch of classist assholes for, idk, expecting people to read and abide by the rules they agreed to when they joined. we quietly banned tiger because it turned out she was in fact annoying the fuck out of most of the mod team and we don't really want her back. good riddance i guess. &#x200b;",BadRPerStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/16f6e08/user_is_asked_to_stop_using_transphobic_language/,0

16f6cns,can a r7 3700x bottleneck a rx6800xt? (bad performance),"so i bought a new rx6800xt, after the clean drive installation i immediately fired up cyberpunk 2077 to test how much my fps improved, which it surely did in some parts, until a got to more cluttered areas where i got as low as 55fps, gpu is not at 99%. &#x200b; same thing with starfield (it came with the card), 55fps in the first major city, again gpu not at 99%. well with that i though ""ok my psu is crapping out"" and not giving the gpu enough power (650w) so i bought a 850w just int case (min for the gpu is 750w). still the same problem (less stutter tho). &#x200b; so i tested destiny 2 which is a fairly ""old"" game, the performance bump is visibly there, but again the gpu never goes 99% nor puts out crazy fps (sits around 90-120) unless i x2 the resolution which diminishes the fps output. &#x200b; even no man's sky, it should shootout something like stable 120fps, and its not there and its sitting at a lower utilization outputing crappy frames. &#x200b; so gpu is never at 99% utilization, so definitely cpu bottleneck?! but that's the catch, the cpu also stays at a low utilization, no matter what. am i reading this wrong? also it takes forever to cool down after use (gets as high as 75c without being full load) but i think that's because my case is too small. &#x200b; all of the testing was done in 1080p minus the destiny 2x render. i know this gpu is overkill for 1080p but i am upgrading the most expensive parts first, would this worsen the bottleneck? &#x200b; amd ryzen 7 3700x 8-core 32gb ram ddr4 corsair vengeace gigabyte b450mds3h 850w mwe gold cooler master",AMDHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/16f6cns/can_a_r7_3700x_bottleneck_a_rx6800xt_bad/,0

16f6c70,it's too hot in here,"be me. no longer-in-the-sandbox iraq contractor. got me a new stateside gig working as a supervisor in a call center in tampa, florida. florida, while not *quite* as hot as iraq (and at least no one was trying to actively kill me) in the call center, it got a tad warm in the spring/summer months. the building was one of those giant assed repurposed malls that failed in the late 80's. they built it up into call centers, but from what i could gather, they never updated the air conditioning. now, add a staff of about *3,000 people* packed asshole to elbow, and by the time spring was winding down, it was usually about 80-85 degrees inside, even with the ac running full bore. hot and occasionally 'whiffy'... some people never seems to maintain good hygiene i swear... anywhoo.... thankfully the dress code was pretty lenient and as long as your shirt wasn't offensive, and the shorts weren't *too* torn up, you could get away with it. i mean it's fucking florida right? as a ""boss"" i had to wear a polo and 'nice shorts' and usually went with my faithful cargoes. my boss, the regional manager was a retired lt col. (25 years) and i was a retired cpl, (10 years medical) so we got along like gangsta af. life was looking pretty sweet. good job, great godlike boss, home w/the fam nightly, good team, having fun... ...he said as the bottom fell out. we came in one monday in april to find out the whole company had been 'consolidated' and 'bought out' and 'new rules' were inbound, to include allllllllll sorts of stupid shit ***to include a dress code***. now, understanding this, we realized we were well and truly fucked. our hr bitch, and yes, she was a bitch, was a bitches bitch. a politically correct sub-70 iqd barely literate dolt who **knew** she was stupid, but reveled in her power. no violation of policy or peccadillo was too small to overlook. she kept a list of how many she fired and would show it off proudly for her 'contribution to insuring smooth running of the business by removing unmotivated individuals.' during staff meetings. think: big, fat, ugly, tattooed jabba-the-hutt looking beee-atcha. with a side order of vindictiveness and stupidity. it was hate-at-first sight for the both of us, what with me being a cisnormative hetro-male warmonger/oppressor who ""din' give her enuff respect"". yeah... ok. fuck her just because. so, summer inbound and we (menfolk) now have to wear polos with undershirt (wtf???) and long pants. (no jeans, again wtf!?!) wimmen had to wear blouses, long pants (no jeans) or a skirt. my boss was highly sympathetic, but he too, was a victim of this insanity. for three weeks we made our case to corporate who told us ""tough noogies"". no shorts/t-shirts anymore... goodbye comfort, welcome to hellscape, population: us... we lost a lot of good staff who quit rather than put up with this shit, and jabba was gleeful in separating them. now mind you, i was an e-4 in the army. a dog robber... a dope dealer... the battalion thief... think radar o'rielly from mash when he was mailing the jeep home or wheeling/dealing toilet paper. not actual 'dope' but essential items and whatnot... ferengi rules of acquisition and all that (yeah i'm a geek)... i was the guy who found 'loopholes' the colonel, after the third fruitless meeting with his boss (who was just as frustrated as he was) he told me to start using my dark side jedi arts to overcome this stupid dress code shit. took me a few days, and i had to put a bit of cash in, but i went to my team, and got all the males to go online and buy a kilt. got the girls (who wanted to) to get a micro-kilt... i had to subsidize some of it as some of my folks were barely making a living, but what the hell right? i mean if you're going to go full retard, then **go all the way.** yep. kilts. now mind you, this was **long before** current day 'stuff'... up til them, the only time you'd usually see a kilt was on st. paddys day, never mind a dress or whatnot on a guy. now i had a 'formal black watch kilt' with regimental sporran from the actual black watch regiment, who i worked with extensively in basra iraq...looooong horsehair sporran, silver chains, the whole nine yards of gorgeousness. when i told the colonel my plan, he was gleeful, and told me he had a kilt in acu (the gray army camo) that he had had made in iraq and wore to events over there. we coordinated it for when the big wigs were coming in on a walking tour. on ""k-day"", my whole team, to include my boss, we were all decked like it was a glasgow bar on a national holiday. jabba predictably lost her collective shit.... it was **great.** in the army, it's called a ""complete loss of military bearing"" for her it was ""screaming like a fucking loon that '**you can't dooooooo dat!!!! dat's aginst the ruuuuuuuuuules!!!!""** the big bosses were not amused by her to say the least. sweet sweet revenge was ours. the head of all hr hustled jabba out of the room, not sure what was said but i don't think she ever spoke a solitary word to me again, except when the company folded. i jumped ship when they were looking for 'volunteers' to bail... i got 3 months severance, insurance and **never** had to see jabba again. and yeah, we got to go back to 'relaxed dress code' i.e. t-shirts/shorts after what was called ""the kilt incident""... it actually helped that the ""brass"" took the tour in three-piece suits and were positively melting as they wandered around...me? i kept wearing mine as i dig me some kiltage, and had a few utilikilts over and above... what can i say? win-win in my book....",FuckeryUniveristy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/16f6c70/its_too_hot_in_here/,0

remembrancers of the administratum imperialus frederickson jack-turning* “the merican empire of the unification wars was one of the great world powers of its age. by the time that emperor of mankind had revealed himself to the people of terra, merica was embroiled in civil. however, this did not diminish their world power. the merica empire was so economically ascendant that their power was seen throughout the world and beyond. wither it was through its great factories, banks, or skilled mercenaries, merica was renowned for its greatness. but it was not always like this. the empire of merica was formed after many centuries of both great conflict and intellectual development. in this tome, we shall outline the history of merican. its rise and final assimilation into the great imperium of mankind. *-the burning periods -* the period after the earth-martian was a period of calamity. much of the global government had collapsed or became so stretched beyond its capacity to help the people of earth. the nord merica continent quickly broke apart much like the rest of the world. some communities would do better than others in the fires of the dying earth. a few places would isolate themselves from the rest of the world and would for a time save themselves from the anarchy. many more ripped themselves apart and their neighbors for what dwindling resources remained. for the next several hundred years life was brutal on the continent. several regional factions rose and fell just as quickly. the continent continued in this state of instability and calamity even while global connections slowly built back up. in this era, before the oceans dried up, the empire of albyon sailed into the continent. first with small excursions; established bases on the east coast. in time this led to a full-on invasion of the northeast. with the continent so disunified, even the most powerful nord american factions were no match to the unified invading albyons. the conquest of nord merica by the albyons took many generations but by the height of the albyons empires, large swathes of nord merica was under their domain in some way or another. *- the occupation period -* although this period was marked by foreign rule, what would be the unified merican identity was created in this era. new settlements and great works were built all over the continent. this broke down old barriers and ancient feuds between the old states and groups of nord merica. the greatest of these works were those of the ancient factoriums bases in the mid-west of the continent what was once great lakes. the albyon empire used these great factories to produce all sorts of equipment for the growing armies. along with these great works of building came also great acts of destruction. the alybon empire was reaching the height of its power during this age. many men, women and creatures were pressed into albyon’s war machine. some time it was in the defense of merica itself like when the mechanicus of mars invaded terra. but more often than not, the warriors of merica were sent on expeditions of conquest and pillage. although under the flags of the unspeakable king, the mericans that fought did so for their own battle brothers rather than for albyon imperial ideals. overtime this too helped solidified the idea of a unified merican people. *- the revolutionary period -* in time, the merican territory’s power and influence eclipsed that of the homeland territories of albyon itself. small, localized insurrections were common across the empire, but total rebellion was unthinkable with the unspeakable king leading the empire. however, in time, quiet rumors became open questions is to the whereabouts of the king and the authority of albyon rule over its foreign lands. the great war of meridan independance was a major turning point in the history of the continent. considered part of the broader greater albyon successionist warring period, the merican war of independence was a particularly brutal conflict that dragged on for many decades and spanned the nord, central, and parts of sud merica. during the war, the rebelling merican parties formed a governing body to oversee merica interest collectively. unlike many nations or factions during this age, the merican government was made up of a calamity of competing interest and parties formed into a senatorial house in a semi electoral process. although the representatives were drawn from ultra wealthy local warlords and merchant kings, this system was quite successful for a time in keeping competing powers in check. a case can be made that albyon was never fully evicted from the nord merican continent, but merica empire eventually came to dominate the continent on all fronts. *-the redevelopment and expansionist period-* *the rocky gold age of merica, this period saw the empire develop culturally and economically. the upper levels of government were reorganized and developed. accademia and the sciences were state funded and progressed. and most importantly, the empire’s economy was booming with active. merica, now with a surplus of war equipment, sold it across the globe and beyond.* with merica in ascension, the empire expanded militarily, economically, ideologically. mass fighting within the central territories of merican became less and less destructive and common. merican boarders and diplomatic power swelled to its greatest heights at this time. merica conquered or colonized its neighbors and held complete dominance over the nord merican continent. as the

16f6bej,i am a survivor of camp consequence," i was a part of the troubled teen industry in the early 2010s. this happened around 10 years ago so i might misremember specific things like logistics. i am 22 now but i was first put in this camp when i was around 10 years old. i admittedly had violent anger issues due to my mother being an abusive narcisict, me being her scapegoat, and a very messy divorce in which my dad (who has always been very close with me and a huge support over the years) was accused of doing very awful and untrue things to me and my siblings by my mom. i couldn't contact or see him for a year when i was seven and for years after that we had government supervised visits once a month until he won custody of me at 14 due to the courts finding out about my mothers abuse and of course, this camp. to be put in this camp you had to have both parents signature which they did not get from my dad, instead having my uncle (mothers sisters husband) sign it, who my mom was dating (whole different story) so he posed as my dad. even after they found out that he wasnt my dad and being threatened to sue by my actual dad if we ever stepped foot on their property again, we were still allowed by the staff to go to weekly meetings. i'll go into more details about the meetings later. i hear a lot about kids being abducted by stangers in the night to be taken to these places but i was abducted by my mother. i was staying at my grandparents house for the weekend with my two siblings when we got a phone call from my mother saying she was going to take us out for ice cream which i thought was odd since we were supposed to be there for a couple more days. we all get in her minivan and after half an hour of driving i start to get confused since we're out in the middle of nowhere at this point. we eventually pull up into what looks like a campground so i assume that we're at my brothers boyscouts meeting. a lady opens the car door and orders us to get out and tells me to put on sneakers. i was wearing my favorite sandals so i asked if it was okay to just wear those and she got in my face and screamed at me for being disrespectful and entitled (a word they and my mom loved using) and that i should just do what she says without questioning it. they confiscated my glasses and my brothers inhaler. keep in mind i still have no idea whats happening at this point. this was the start of a weekend of hard labor and abuse. so this camp is a ""family camp"". if one kid goes the whole family goes (only the first time), so my siblings were a part of this too and everyone there including my mom made sure i knew that they were being tortured because of me. all day in the florida heat, 90+ degrees, we had to do repetitive hard labor; pick up bullets from the range without bending at the knees, shovel a pile of gravel into another pile 20 feet away, etc. all while wearing an orange jumpsuit like prisoners. if you refused, took a break, or talked (among other things) you would get screamed at by the drill sergeants and staff and if you kept doing whatever got you screamed at they'd add another day to your stay or something like that. the parents would follow around the group of kids at a distance and were not allowed to interact with us in any way. the kids could talk to eachother at meal times (even that was a privilege that could be taken away) but if they saw you giggling or having a good time or talked too loud or whatever you'd get screamed at real fast. a punishment they loved using was to go stand with your nose on the wall until they told you to stop. i swear sometimes they'd just forget you there. they called these time outs but the real point was to humiliate you. we would get fiber one cereal for breakfast (i am autistic and have sever food sensitivities so this stuff was like eating puke), one pb&j for lunch, and tomato soup and crackers for dinner. if you complained you wouldn't get to eat. we would get one gallon jug of warm water to carry around all day to drink. if you did even the slightest thing wrong you would be screamed at. i remember my sweet baby brother had an allergic reaction to something the first day and when he tried to tell someone about it a drill sergeant got an inch away from his face and spat and screamed at him for talking back and then screamed at him some more when he started crying. there were even more extreme punishments like shaving your head. i didnt know at the time but i doubt my mom would have let that happen to us, not because she cared about us, she just would have been too embarrassed to take us anywhere. she's all about maintaining appearances. at the end of the day we had little ""tents"" (no zipper and no floor) just big enough to fit inside that were in a field of grass. they had thin plastic mattresses and one blanket, no pillow. ants (even fire ants) would crawl all over you while you slept because you were basically laying in a field. one night we couldn't use the tents for some reason so the girls were told to gather in the eating area which was just a pavilion over some gravel. we spent the night sleeping on that gravel with just a blanket. every morning we'd be woken up by military style trumpets (which is still a trigger for me to this day) at 6am to be sent to do more labor. you don't get to shower and have to use the bathroom in a bucket. kids as young as 6 years old can be enrolled here. one day we trekked a couple miles up a road to the prison the camp was situated on to take a tour and talk with the prisoners. we had to eat the prison food and the inmates were intimidating. we each took a turn being locked in solitary for a while. the whole thing was to threaten us, like this is where we'd end up if we didn't change our behavior.",offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16f6bej/i_am_a_survivor_of_camp_consequence/,0
16f6b51,"hot take: the onednd changes to bear totem barbarian are exactly what people have been asking for, and just getting a general force resistance or ""all but psychic"" resistance would be a step backwards.","one of the most common complaints is that all classes should have meaningful choices, not just the spellcasters. people want to do interesting things with fighters, barbarians, monks, rogues. they want to be faced with dilemmas, multiple scenarios, a series of choices where there optimal response will differ based on circumstance. how often have we heard ""i'm sick of '***rage and then attack***' being the best option in each scenario!""? i've certainly heard it a lot. so, what do the new changes do? they create a scenario where, if you don't know what damage an enemy does, the optimal choice may be to not rage on your first turn, wait to see what the enemies can do, then rage. it creates a choice. you have to evaluate the circumstances, the knowledge available to your character, and decide, instead of raging and attacking always being the best option. similarly, just giving barbarian resistance to force damage for free doesn't lead to interesting choices. it's a passive, always-on feature. meaningful choices will necesserily seem like nerfs, because if you have one option that is already the best thing in all scenarios, you cannot add anything without increasing the class's current power (breaking the existing, presumably perfect, class balance), you can only split the ability into different choices. this creates the possibility of using the wrong ability for a situation, which is obviously weaker. but there's no way to add complexity that doesn't do this! yes, you might make the wrong choice! a wizard might cast fireball on something that is immune to fire! giving interesting tactical options to players must, necesserily, include the option for players to make poor choices. you can call that a ""nerf"" if you like, but if so, then the only thing you can do to make bear totem barbarian more interesting is to nerf it. it will always be ""boring"" when one option is the best choice for ***every single scenario***. what people seem to want is for multiple choices, all of which are the best in any scenario... which is pointless. meaningful tactics has to mean that some choices aren't going to work in some circumstances!",dndnext,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/16f6b51/hot_take_the_onednd_changes_to_bear_totem/,0

16f6493,huge league advice,"hello everyone, &#x200b; six months ago today, i made the decision to quit playing league of legends, and i strongly encourage others to do the same. prior to quitting, i would play for several hours each day. as you can see yuumi is/was my favourite champion to play (check link). back when she was released, her kit was so different to play and had actual mechanics. however riot decided to dumb her down so that even smooth brainers are able to eat and play at the same time while afking on fellow players. what pushed me to this decision were several factors but one of the most notable was her rework. this was the finishing move that set an already collapsing building on fire. &#x200b; take it from someone that has been playing this shit game for far too long. if you genuinely do not enjoy league, play it because you got nothing better to do, don´t want to quit because of your friends who play it regularly or just think grinding your rank is worth it, maybe it's time to throw in the towel. you can find way better things to do that actually improve your life. personally, i've been hitting the gym more, getting more work done, learning new skills like web design and copywriting, and even started a youtube channel to make regular content. i am not trying to play the moralizer and definitely am not trying to tell anyone what to do, if you do have fun with this game and only play it from time to time. i can just say whatever floats your boat. but for me, quitting the game was one of the best moves i could've done in 2023, and i recommend at least considering it! &#x200b; let me know what you guys think, and for those interested, here's a link to my main account: [ LINK also, thats my youtube if you are interested lol: [ LINK ",yuumimains,https://www.reddit.com/r/yuumimains/comments/16f6493/huge_league_advice/,0

16f62hn,so tired of this job (vent),"fyi i've only been here for 2 months and this is my experience so far. it was fine until management at my store decided to aggressively push apps. got called for a one on one and they expect us to push the plus memberships on everybody we ring up, even the small quick purchases. i was behind on apps and cards, and my manager was really laying it on me for my lack of performance. it is exhausting trying to keep up with the goals. ever since the one on one its been constant putting pressure over me ever single shift to recite their stupid ass pitch and acronyms. i'm tired of having this weighing down on my head. i just graduated college with a ba in computer science. right now this job is just a means to an end and eventually i'll get out of this retail hell. i have 2 write ups now bcz i can't be bothered to even try anymore and i am depressed. to the point where, i really wanna quit fast before i find something in tech. it's just misery working for this company. does anybody feel like this too? and is it worth staying for a little more until i get fired?

16f470i,"jack the ""drought""","first i want to say is that i don't read the sbs or vivre cards ive only looked at jacks and am using the information from the manga and anime. for a fishmen to be labeled the drought seems odd to me. why if all the disasters was he labeled the drought. king the wildfire for his flames, queen the plague for his countless diseases and chemical weapons. but all we ever get from jack is that he leaves the land he walks on destroyed like a drought. no i think there's something more to this, and his appearance helps. notice how jack doesn't reveal any of his fishmen qualities, his mask to cover his teeth, his fur coat to cover his gills. when we first saw jack we assumed he was human just like luffy. so why the ""drought"" and not anything like the tsunami, flood, or potentially even blizzard because of his mammoth fruit. i think the simple answer is that he wants to hide his fishmen nature, no clear answer as to why. kaido has a few races in his ranks and i'm 100% sure he doesn't mind fishmen. my guess is to do with fishmen being viewed in a negative light in the world, maybe to hide his identity so no one looks down on him for being one or maybe to protect fishmen since him being a prominent member of the beast pirates wouldnt be a good example as fishmen as a whole.",OnePiece,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/16f470i/jack_the_drought/,0

16f0uim,a black market litrpg - chapter 2: seven snakes,"[first]( LINK |[previous]( LINK \------------------------------------------------------------- “this was supposed to be an easy fight!” a meaty hand slammed the wooden table, causing the map made out of parchment on the table and empty mugs of ale to tremble. the same hand pointed menacingly at a group of young men, who flinched slightly. “all you had to do was defend against the red lions, and instead, you idiots turned it into an ugly fight that got one of the fodder killed for nothing. we lost control of that entire block!” the owner of the hand berated the group, chiding them for their incompetence. “it wasn’t our fault – riker was too strong! we need more equipment and train-” one of the guys complained, infuriated at the one-sided scolding. “you’re useless, damian. i could easily beat him with one hand tied behind my back if i was there. back in my heyday, i was a champion in this sector! me, ulon baktar! even the ardent cretins was small fries during our time.” the gang leader of the seven snakes smacked his chest with that same meaty hand. then why don’t you go there and fight yourself, huh? damian internally raged as ulon baktar went on a spiel about the good old days and how the seven snakes used to be a great gang, controlling more than five districts in the south sector. now they were a small-time racket, barely a factor in the criminal underbelly of raktor. damian was not even sure they truly controlled the district now, with the red lions moving in. the only reason why most of the twenty gang members remained behind was that they were far too weak to join the other gangs, as well as being locals of this district right here. their friends, family and acquaintances were all here – leaving the gang meant their relationships would be subject to abuse by ulon, a form of blackmail. damian grimaced, shooting a glare at ulon. if only i had enough strength to kill him in a duel to become leader instead… but it was not for lack of trying: damian had seen other braver gang members get killed: ulon had a unique necklace made out of three green crystals that healed him as well, causing any duel to turn into one of attrition. until i find a way to overcome that necklace… “don’t you know how i became gang leader? i duelled the previous one as per tradition, winning easily! it is all of you, the useless trash, that is dragging down the reputation we once had!” ulon accused. before ulon could continue his monologue any further, the door burst wide open, causing everyone in the room to turn their heads immediately. a shocked murmur spread through the group like wildfire, their eyes not believing what they were seeing. what?! alvin?! kyle hawthorn entered, dragging the badly beaten-up riker behind him, who was still slightly whimpering as the rough flooring continuously cut into his wounded limbs. kyle had riker’s enchanted metal pipe strapped to his belt, his clothes still stained with dried blood. tossing riker to the side without care, kyle walked up to face ulon directly, who was still sitting behind the table in shock. “you are the gang leader of the seven snakes?” kyle asked stoically. “al-alvin, i heard from damian that you were badly hurt. they thought you dead! where did you find riker? was it another gang that intervened? did we get back the block?” ulon hardly cared about alvin’s survival. he was far more happy about seeing one of red lion’s goons in terrible shape, focusing on riker’s bruised face with glee. a victory was hard to come by in the seven snakes, even for all of ulon’s ranting. kyle snapped his fingers once in the air, a light but somehow extremely clear and attention-grabbing action. “answer the question.” ulon was slightly taken aback by the sheer confidence and authority that alvin now radiated out of nowhere. instead of replying directly, ulon was more angered by the fact that this lowly fodder had the audacity to act like he was in charge. “yes, i am your gang leader, and i order you to get back in line before i punish you again! seems like the gang fight has made you forget how things run around here!” ulon roared as he stood up, clearly in a furious rage. kyle, however, did not break his gaze, staring right into ulon’s eyes. “i heard you killed the previous leader in a duel. as per tradition, i challenge you to a duel for the position of the gang leader.” the entire room was stunned, some even rubbing their ears to make sure they were not hearing things. seeing riker badly injured was one thing, but now the weak alvin suddenly standing up to ulon? damian couldn’t believe what he was witnessing, attempting to step forward to intervene, hoping to save alvin from a premature death. “boss, please forgive him. he may be a bit muddled from the fig-“ ulon only held up a hand, motioning for damian to shut the fuck up, before he squinted his eyes at kyle, completely serious. “you do know it’s a life-or-death duel?” “life or death only matters for you.” the arrogant reply and the nonchalant expression on kyle’s face irked ulon even more, pushing him over the edge. “good; if you want to be beaten to death so much, i’ll happily oblige. i won’t be killing off my property so soon, though – i’ll have you taste punishment!” “very well.” kyle immediately delivered a solid kick in place, smacking the entire table right into ulon and toppling him over his chair. the impact had the flimsy wooden table splinter apart in the middle, causing ulon to be caught off-guard and slightly disoriented from the shock as he tried to recover. before ulon could even make a move, kyle grabbed the enchanted metal pipe from his waist belt, charging right in and smacking it as hard as he could on ulon’s undefended head. a loud snapping sound was heard, ulon’s forearm bone shattering in a desperate attempt to block, a solid gash of blood erupting. [system message] item [enchanted metal pipe (basic)] a pipe to bend the rules active skill: reinforcement – increased force when hitting mp cost per activation: 2 mp duration: thirty seconds cooldown: two minutes however, unlike riker’s activation of the engraving, kyle’s pipe did not glow at all, showing no apparent difference from a normal pipe. he could not feel any bonus nor special effects happening either. it did not matter to kyle for now – as long as the weapon existed, he could use it. it was all the same to him. instead of crying out, ulon bore the pain and began to try and fight back while he still lay on the floor, throwing a few punches and kicks, engravings on the three crystals of his unique necklace glowing green. a green aura enveloped ulon, healing the wound on his forearm like magic and mending slowly, the healing process of the body accelerated. “hah, you think you can-“ another quick smack on his arm interrupted ulon, cracking his forearm again, followed by a flurry of rapid hits. kyle wasn’t about to let ulon heal, continuously whacking repeatedly, keeping up the barrage. damian and the other gang members were rooted to the spot, none of them stepping forward to intervene in the duel as they watched a masterclass in unforgiving violence play out right before their eyes. “wai-wait! stop!” ulon screamed, sticking his other good arm out, which was unceremoniously hit by the enchanted metal pipe too. kyle whacked with consistency, never stopping and with a constant breath, as though he was pounding a dough in a rhythm. the beating continued for three minutes without pause, the necklace’s glow beginning to fade. ulon could barely talk now, his face a complete mess covered in blood and snot, the green aura failing to keep up with the damage inflicted. kyle finally grabbed the metal pipe with both arms before smashing it right down on ulon’s head, a soft little spurt echoing through the office. none of the other members dared to move even after the duel had ended, shocked by the sheer brutality revealed by alvin. it was like a different human – no, a monster had awoken within alvin. kyle was about to raise his metal pipe to hit ulon again when an intrusive message in the form of purple ‘holograms’ appeared once again in front of him. he noticed no one else reacted to the appearance. i must be the only one who can see this. [system message] killed [ulon baktar] , +500 exp [system message] level up!level 2 ---> level 9 [stats increase] all stats increasebonus free points granted kyle rested his bloodied metal pipe on his shoulders and bent over to rip ulon’s necklace from his neck, curious about the source of the green aura.

kyle did not focus on that right now, instead glancing around at the frightened gang members. “anyone else want to try me?” the gang members shook their heads rapidly, including damian. while ulon was a slob and a lazy leader, there was no doubt he was well-defended and had a solid constitution. the number of hits kyle had to deliver to kill ulon was a testimonial to that. kyle didn’t even look tired out, his eyes still staring directly at them with rapt attention while his pipe still had beads of blood trickling down its length. “no, leader.” damian bowed immediately, a slight fear erupting on his face as he realised that kyle could maybe beat all of them up without breaking a sweat. if i couldn’t beat ulon in a duel, i certainly can’t beat alvin now! “good. from now on, the gang is under me. the name shall remain the same. who’s the oldest gang member here?” kyle asked. damian and the gang members looked at each other, completely confused about alvin’s apparent memory loss. did he really not remember anything about the gang? “i’ve been here the longest, about five years now, alvin.” “ok, the rest of you, dump him into the nutri-recycler or the airlock and get out of this room. throw that ‘riker’ guy into the cells. you stay. also, from now on, my name is kyle, got it?” kyle motioned to the corpse of ulon and the unconscious riker with a dismissive tone. expressions of utter confusion were apparent to the gang members. they began to whisper among each other, wondering if alvin finally went senile or was pushed to the edge by the near-death experience, creating a completely different personality out of nowhere. what the fuck was a nutri-recycler? a loud and clear snap rang through the room again. “i said, got it?” kyle stared them down with a stern expression, causing the rest of the gang members to nod their heads vigorously, exiting the room while carrying the dead ulon and unconscious riker, leaving damian alone with kyle. kyle kicked the broken table apart, retrieved the somehow structurally sound chair and sat down on it before staring right at damian. “name?” “alvin, do you not remember me? what happened to you in that fight? i swear i didn’t mean to abandon you; it’s just…” damian rambled, before looking up into kyle’s eyes, seeing that he was extremely serious and not in a joking manner. the blotches of blood that stained kyle’s hair, clothes and face only made it more apparent. “my name is damian, leader.” damian formally replied after a few seconds, to which kyle finally nodded. “i’m going to be asking some questions. you will answer immediately and directly to the best of your abilities.” damian nodded. did he lose all his memories, and another personality took over? “good. i only need to know four things. first, economic factors. what is the current state of the economy? average debt per person?” “eco-what?” damian was already lost. kyle took a long deep breath, slowly exhaling in exasperation. damian rubbed his hands nervously as he saw a glimpse of irritation cross kyle’s face. “fine. what is the population of the city?” “yes, sir, the city of raktor is home to approximately eight million people. we are currently in the south sector.” he did lose all his memories. “what is the level of technology here?” “level of technology…? well, most of the new stuff runs on arctech, machinery and so on. i’m not sure how to explain it…” damian scratched his head, completely confused as to what kyle was asking. kyle frowned visibly, causing damian to tense up slightly. “how does this city make money? do you have a currency system?” “make money? alvin, now you’re talking like some strang-“ damian caught himself before he talked any further, aware of kyle’s increasingly frustrated glare. “ah yes, the city is a big trade hub, so most of the money comes from trading and services. we’re at the edge of the empire, bordering two other nations. there are a good number of factories in the south sector, but they are still fairly new and not scaled up yet; mostly research. the currency is rakels.” “so a nascent industrialisation society…” “na-sce-nt?” “ignore that. how do the seven snakes make money now?” damian was familiar with this, having been in the gang for nearly five years. something alvin should be familiar with too. “oh, the usual. we provide protection services to traders and stall owners in this district as well as other shops. we also trade in alcohol and own a few brothels. or at least we used to.” “alcohol?” “yes, wine, moonshine mostly. there’s a citywide ban on alcohol and many other things now, so the gangs have been fighting or negotiating for every inch of territory to cash in on potential customers. that was why we were fighting for that area, alv… kyle. leader, sorry.” kyle’s eyes seemed to light up. it seems that one of his first steps has already been accomplished. “how rich are we now relative to the rest of the city? top 5%, i assume?” “pe-rc-ent? what’s that? actually, we’ve been in debt since three months ago to the crimson swords in the east sector.” damian said with a sheepish smile. kyle’s eyes immediately lost their light, but he was unfazed. there was still a chance. “you mentioned arctech; what’s that?” “arctech is equipment that relies on energy, specifically arcia energy that can be found stored in arcite ore.” kyle recalled seeing the term ‘arcia energy’ in the intrusive purple window previously for ulon’s healing necklace. “arcite?” “a mineral that provides arcia energy, other than living beings like us and leylines. something that powers weapons like your metal pipe.” kyle checked his still bloodied metal pipe, noticing the runes on it. it did not activate when he was swinging it for some reason. “how big is our gang? this can’t be all the members, right? where are the rest? i was told by a red lion member that we control an entire district.” damian was a bit ashamed, seeing kyle ask it with such confidence. “this is the full strength. twenty men are all we have. we barely have any money to recruit any more. we used to be bigger.” damian watched kyle grip the metal pipe even harder, causing him to tremble slightly as kyle’s face seemed to simmer with rage or disappointment. kyle pondered for a moment before realising something was missing. “are drugs banned? psychedelics? hallucinatory products?” kyle tried every term he could think of that damian would register. “ps-ki-eric-ks? drugs? what? if you’re talking about hallucinations, an engraved arctech array or a potion would be able to inflict illusions. we have alchemists in the city, though such potions are ridiculously overpriced and hard to procure. only the well-to-do use them on the regular for parties…” a small smile appeared on kyle’s face as he heard the keywords he wanted to hear, which only frightened damian even more. it was the smile of a businessman knowing he’d found a hole in the market. “now we’re getting somewhere.” welcome to raktor, kyle hawthorn level 9 max hp: 58(+0)(+0)(+0) max mp: 0(+0)(+0)(+0) max sta: 58(+0)(+0)(+0) [status effects] none [stats] race human class ???

16f0k9o,am i wrong asking for a refund on my friends airbnb with heavy wildfire smoke,"back in june my friend said to pick any weekend and we could stay at her dads cabin. she made it sound like it would be for free but ended up asking us to pay the nightly rate he charges on air bnb, which i thought was understandable, it was $1400. 4 days before the trip i was told there was heavy wild fire smoke there and with my mil health, they might not be able to go if it continued. that day i texted my friend to see what the cancellation policy was. she said there was none and i would get no money back. luckily the smoke stopped and we continued with our trip. however, the day i asked my friend about the cancellation policy, i also looked up their house on air bnb and saw they allow 100% refund 5 days before and 50% until day off. i was honestly hurt and felt lied to about it. i eventually let her know how i was feeling and she admitted she lied about the air bnb policy because she didn’t want to be out money, but now she’s furious i would be mad she lied and she instead has every right to lie and be mad because in her words “if my mil is concerned about natural fires and her health, she shouldn’t travel in the summer at all”. we have been going to this same resort for the last 3 labor day weekends and have never had problems with smoke. she also said her dad did us a favor allowing us to stay in his house but in my opinion we did him one by not using airbnb because he wasn’t charged a fee for using them. am i wrong and out of line to expect to be treated with the same courtesy they give strangers with cancellations? frankly i would have just booked through airbnb so we could have insurance for situations like this. i didn’t really imagine i would need it when it’s between friends.",amiwrong,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/16f0k9o/am_i_wrong_asking_for_a_refund_on_my_friends/,0

16ez7yd,the state of the world is not a good reason not to have children,"to start this off: i'm not trying to deny climate change, gatekeep childfree-ness or bash people for not having children. i'm childfree myself for other reasons. this is for the folks who want kids but feel they shouldn't due to the state of the world. some time ago i watched a documentary about women in germany who want to get sterilized and not have children. their reason? they feel the world is too cruel and life is going to be very hard for their children. one woman actually desperately wanted children, but felt she couldn't justify putting them into this environment. she seemed very altruistic and educated about world affairs, to the point she saw no perspective for the next generation. this sentiment seems to be echoed everywhere in the media as well: all of humanity is going to be destroyed by climate change, economic collapse and war - so why create more people to perpetuate the suffering? for about 70% of the world i'd somewhat agree with this statement. if you can't educate your children, provide them food and drink and a roof over their head; if drought, dying lands and wildfires are taking away your livelihood and your home; if people are dying of diseases, hunger and violence - then you're really better off not having children if you can avoid it. but in germany? in sweden?? for the other 30% of the world, which i'd group any western country in, i can't really understand this sentiment in people. i'm aware i had a very privileged, safe upbringing here in germany, so i can't claim to know the extent of suffering that people go through in this country or the world in general. the summers are getting hotter, shit is getting more expensive, natural disasters are happening more frequently. these are the challenges of our times. maybe i'm just not educated enough to grasp what we're in for as a species, but i genuinely believe we're going to adapt somehow. over the course of hundreds of thousands of years billions of people have lived fulfilling lives despite hardship. we've been hunter gatherers. we've been farmers. we've gone through a plague that killed 1/3 of europe. the farmers in 15th century germany could've never imagined a system where they and their children would have the same rights as the monarchs and clerics in a democratic system. many of our grandparents who were lucky enough to survive wwii still went on to watch their families grow and live happily into their retirement. none of these people had the amount of resources we do, and yet we're complaining the most about how life is not worth living just because things are hard. this is not to tell poor people who are struggling to get by ""just be grateful and man up"". what i hate is the sentiment that life is only worth living if you always have everything you want and never experience any struggle whatsoever. in the west we're closer to this ""paradise"" than any human in history, but realistically it's never going to be perfect. if the current system is so terrible that it's not worth living in - then which system is? are we dreaming of a life of no work, responsibilities, fear, pain, hunger or any suffering whatsoever? some parts of the world are going to be uninhabitable for humans, no doubt about that. rising sea levels in some areas (island nations, pretty much all the coasts), heat and droughts in others (looking at africa and asia). what about the other parts? my theory is that the influx of people migrating north is going to cause a lot of social unrest and lack of resources. it's going to be a challenge, to put it lightly. but are we going to go extinct altogether? i honestly don't think so. there's so much more i want to say, but here's my final appeal: if you don't want kids, absolutely don't have them. but if you do, and the only thing holding you back is the threat of societal doomsday - your children are going to be fine. teach them survival skills and how to grow their own food maybe. someone's gotta fight for the future of humanity.",TrueUnpopularOpinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/16ez7yd/the_state_of_the_world_is_not_a_good_reason_not/,0

16eylut,the spirit of a predator - chapter 14: a walk through nature,"\[ [first]( LINK / [previous]( LINK / next \] &#x200b; *cw for those who are bothered by animal cruelty.* *credit to* u/weithbec*, who may as well be considered a cowriter at this point.* &#x200b; ***memory transcript subject:*** *qitel, yotul exterminator* *date \[standardized human time\]: november 15th, 2136* nekal was not pleased with the outcome on my first solo mission, but remained adamant that i was most suited to experimenting with new methods of operation. ""a wild card,"" as he’d called me. “independent too, the best starting point for experimenting with solo field work.” well, this wasn't one of those operations. instead, nekal had placed me in charge of a motley crew of other non-native exterminator recruits from our own office, and i was eager to prove that i was a worthy addition to the roster. of course, i envied the others who had already gotten tailored uniforms for the job. i was still sporting the baggy fireproof cloak that i was before, though with a more modern visor that didn't constrict my breathing nor speech nearly as much as the last. my issued flamethrower was of a more up-to-date design too, and i secretly tinkered with the fuel mixture and other bits of it in the armory to get the most efficiency i could. i'd been reprimanded for openly brandishing my firearm in public, since the guild still had to kneel to the demands of the inept magister, kanek. each move seemed to be made to cripple us more and more with every passing week as she was a bad faith actor who pleaded for people to ""think of the humans"" when our planet was already going through a severe financial crisis. *the humans could rot for all i cared.* ""*snrk*."" the snicker came from the driver side rear, originating from lav. i glowered at him to see what was so funny and the harchen waggled his toes in a teasing manner. ""never seen a yotul move their ears like a venlil,"" he quipped. ""surprised there's enough going on in that head to move them!"" another ""primitive"" jab. classic. ""gch. this, coming from the one who i saw moisturizing his eyes with his tongue? why don't you use *modern technology* like the rest of us and get eye drops?"" the other two occupants, dewl and caveq, chuckled at our exchange. *""eye drops,*"" caveq repeated from the driver's seat. caveq was a sulean, the first jildi native i'd ever met in person. he said little, except to echo whatever quote it was he just found funny, and i suspected he wasn't all that bright upstairs from the few interactions i had with him. that made it quite ironic that he too mocked me for being ""technologically impaired"" the same way everyone else i'd ever met did. dewl was a zurulian who had apparently failed medical school, leaving him few job opportunities besides doing grunt work for the guild. i wasn't one for questioning one's eating habits, but i was certain that i'd seen him replace some of the files in one of his office drawers with loads of packaged snacks, which was certainly against company policy. last was the first one who spoke: lav. tech savvy and chatty, he did little to distinguish himself among the rest of his kind besides an apparent addiction to the simulations on his holopad. at 16, he was the youngest of our group, but seemed to talk to the rest of us as though he was the one in charge, which was slowly whittling at my patience. this was the group nekal had assigned me to lead headlong into danger, into the wilderness where predators, sapient or not, lurked. this group represented the newest generation of the guild going forward. the last, stalwart line between innocence and chaos. we were the ones who would rally to the defense of millions. i spotted caveq picking at his nose. *we inspire nothing.* ""*turn left now.*"" the sulean repeated the instructions out loud as he redirected the truck off the road at the behest of the navigator application, and i gripped the handle on the ceiling to keep myself from turning my lunch into a floor decoration. the truck lurched to and fro as the dense driver took the straightest path to the location where we'd start our search. i could hear the auxiliary gear that was mounted on the outside of the truck rattle with every jolt, but nothing of great importance was out there besides spare parts for the flamethrowers. i could spot dewl was having much the same struggle as i with the sulean's driving, though lav somehow managed to keep his eyes plastered on the holopad simulator he refused to mute despite the circumstances. i wasn't sure how long the ride was, nor if the truck could handle much more abuse, but we mercifully came to a stop at the edge of an opening where trees were cleared for miles. off in the distance, i could just barely make out the white peaks of the belimal range, faded against the venlil prime sky over the turquoise horizon. *what a breathtaking view for such dirty business.* we disembarked from the wretched truck after a cursory review of our gear. i checked my holopad to see that we were the furthest tendril of the search effort, the other three trucks checking in much closer to town; that meant it'd just be us if anything went awry. the suncast valley office was only the largest of the contributors of this little event, as we also had the subsidiary offices within our district searching their area for the miscreant. the other guild parties checked in, though they weren’t even visible on the map for me to mull over. i laid my pad back on the seat, hoisting my flamethrower onto my shoulder. ""alright… stick close, and keep the pilot lights for your flamers off until we spot trouble. no point wasting fuel. *and stick together*."" the other three complied, making sure their valves were shut to ensure there was no idle leakage as we trudged across the vast wilderness. we'd engage in an octagonal pattern a few miles wide that would take us back to the truck, hopefully covering the whole area in just a single claw. lav had the path mapped out on his holopad, and prattled off when we deviated from the course. we lacked radios, or anything else that would speed up the process while the rest of the guild would probably be back home in their cozy office, with their cold air conditioning and courtesy water cups. regardless, we were making pretty good progress and reached the fifth point before we were even halfway through the claw. we took a break to recuperate, reveling in the shade of a bush which kept the sun off our backs as we wondered amongst ourselves if the fugitive venlil would even survive out here on his own. he likely didn't have food or water, and the creek up the way was too deep to fjord for anyone here, let alone a meager venlil. ""maybe he got eaten by a human!"" lav remarked. ""you read about those ones out here? the ones who… *kill babies*?"" ""we've all read those stories by now, kid,"" dewl groaned, removing his boots to massage his sore paws. ""bunch of sensationalist predatorshit if you ask me. i don't much like humans, but they're at least capable of *not* killing children from what i've heard. probably."" ""what if the terran government is paying off the naysayers,"" caveq added, ""or worse, making them… *disappear!*"" ""you know, you make a point,"" lav sneered. ""a stupid point, but a point regardless."" caveq seemed to take offense, ""yeah? then how would you explain why people are so quick to pledge allegiance to the predators? you think they are supporting them *voluntarily*?"" ""i *think* there's no point in explaining politics to the guy who i had to help un-brick his computer when it kept freezing-"" he turned to all of us- ""6,000 tabs open, by the way. you tell me how that's possible in just four days."" “*i was doing research.*” “*on what?!*” this inane back and forth went on for about ten minutes, though i chose not to contribute anything myself. i became focused on something up the way. i had to tilt my head to one side to spot it, but there was something in the distance; i couldn't make out what it was from here but it was unmistakably moving around. i put my mask back on and lit the pilot light for my flamethrower. the soft crackling of electricity immediately replaced the group's yapping and three more flames coughed to life as we gathered in a loose formation. *i had to hand it to them, they could at least take a cue.* whatever creature was wallowing in the tall grass, it was barely visible. we slowly approached, the only sound being the near-silent hiss of the primed lights, ready to incinerate with the pull of a trigger. the closer we got, the less we could tell what the beast was, but the shape was clearly not that of a venlil. *a human? no, if it were a predator, it'd do more to conceal itself.* i exchanged looks with the other three who i hoped reached the same conclusion as myself, though it was hard to tell through the masks we wore. i couldn't even inform caveq that his pressure valve was turned too low for fear that we'd alert the creature. i could only hope he would wisen up to it. the wind blew in our face as we got within earshot of the animal that we'd sighted, and i could hear the sound of chewing. what it was chowing on was a mystery, but i was ready for whatever i saw, flesh or flora. *crack*. we all snapped to attention to whatever the sound was. dewl had stepped on a branch, and i didn't need to see through his visor to know that his face read ""uh-oh"". we turned back to the beast, which had reared its head above the grassy cover. it was a sleek creature that had thick, mottled gray and white fur, with a horn protruding from its slender snout, another from just above its side-facing eyes. we saw that what it was chewing on was simply the grass that it surrounded itself in, and it gazed at us as it chewed slowly, clearly as perplexed by us as we were of it. we all relaxed upon seeing that it was nothing more than a grazing prey, and lav snuffed the torch on his flamethrower, removing his visor. ""d'aww, look at it!"" he laughed, stepping toward it. ""it's just trying to eat grass, and we went and disturbed it!"" the animal continued chewing the closer we got, but seemed to take a step toward us. i could spot its nostrils flaring as it seemed to be trying to take stock of us, though we were still downwind. ""guys,"" the harchen laughed as he and it drew nearer, ""this is actually pretty cool! look, i think it likes us!"" but something felt off. ""lav, get away from it,"" i hissed. ""what? it's the most obvious prey animal i've ever seen! side-facing eyes are a *dead giveaway*!"" he jabbed a toe at his own eyes to accentuate his point. ""let the kid have his fun,"" dewl remarked. ""probably the longest he's kept his eyes off of his holopad in ages."" caveq chuckled in implied agreement, and i was left alone with the nagging feeling that things weren't going to go well. ""lav, i'd prefer if you stayed with us instead of-"" ""bah! the yotul's trying to tell me what i should do! it's not like you'd understand what-"" before he could finish, the beast let out a snort and lowered its head, charging at the curious harchen. his skin turned a shade of pink as he was startled by the change in demeanor, and tried to turn and run. the rampaging beast closed the distance too quickly however, and even as i leveled my flamethrower to rake it with fire, it drove its head into the back of our youngest team member, flinging him into the air. he couldn't even let out a scream as he tumbled through the air and over the feral creature's back, hitting the ground with a *thud.* ""light it up, dammit!"" three jets of incinerating justice found themselves directed at the creature, but even my tuned-up fuel propulsion wasn't far enough to do more than spook the animal away. it turned back toward the wounded lav, and i knew we had to do something. ""move up! get it away from him!"" we could hear the harchen squeak in pain from beneath the grass and the beast seemed to be attracted to his anguish, strengthening my resolve. i didn't check to see if the others had heeded my command. i would kill this filthy predator with my own bare paws if i had to. my heart rate escalated as i neared the animal, which seemed to take interest in the wounded exterminator on the ground. ""come on, you fucking animal,"" i growled, my gloves tightening around the trigger as it got closer. ""*come on!*"" *fwoosh*. another stream of burning fuel was thrown at the creature, but once again fell short. my flamethrower gasped for air as it tried to repressurize the tank again, but especially after my uptuning, it wouldn't be in time. the horned beast now had its sights set on me. caveq tried to let loose his own ball of flame, but it barely reached a few meters before fizzling out ineffectually. he cursed and twisted the device around to adjust the knob. dewl could be seen trying to make his way to lav to apply whatever help he could. with the great beast making a dead sprint for me, i was the only one who could defend myself; without any other option, i felt a steely resolve fill my chest. i wasn't the sniveling prey the rest of the federation was taught to be, and found it within myself to fight back against the animal. i dropped my flamethrower to the ground with a clatter, readying myself. i called out to the beast as it charged, dodging to the side as it closed the distance. it barreled on by, its cloven hooves proving efficient at a quick stop for another pass just a few meters away. i could see caveq backing off, angrily fiddling with his flamethrower. drawing my pistol, i braced myself for the next charge. ""c'mon, beastie. come get your prey."" it reared its head as it made another rush, and i tried to dodge again, but the murderous animal was smarter than i thought. it adjusted course as i tried to move out of the way, and though it missed me with the horns atop its grotesque face, it caught me with the point of its shoulder\*, flooring me. the ravenous fauna lunged immediately and i dug one paw into its thick pelt as it attempted to skewer me with the horn on its nose. i was dragged along the dirt as it thrashed me about, the bony nose spike painfully digging into my side despite the rush of adrenaline that kept me cognizant. a hoof kicked against my knee, and i let out a frustrated growl as nothing i did seemed to keep the loathsome animal off of me for long. i couldn't raise my gun to shoot the creature as long as it kept me pinned to the ground, and my flamethrower was too far out of my grasp. with me being the only one of us who was afforded a firearm, that left me alone to fend against the beast. ""get off him!"" i heard caveq bray, and there was a *crack* as the handle of a flamethrower collided with the side of my attacker's face, causing it to reel back. this was my opportunity. i quickly leveled the sidearm, aiming it about where i thought the heart would be and- *pop pop pop.* three gunshots echoed across the plains, and i saw as orange blood began to blossom in the animal's fur around the neck and chest. spooked by the loud noise, it tried running, but only got a short distance before collapsing. ""lav! dewl!"" i called out to my team. ""over here!"" i saw dewl waving an arm above the tall grass, and we rushed over to them. pain spiked in my abdomen, and i pressed a paw against the affected area, green blood glistening against the glove as i lifted it to check. ""fuck."" i made it to the other two, with the zurulian hunched over the wounded harchen. dewl had him laid on his side, though the kid still whimpered in pain. ""gash on the back. superficial but still pretty painful. doesn't appear to have any fractures that need immediate attending, but we need to get him to the truck and to a hospital in the event of internal hemorrhaging or a collapsed lung."" ""f-fucking… guess you were right, qitel,"" the wounded teen managed to choke out in between pained sobs. ""nasty hole you've got there, b-by the way."" ""next time, you're going to heed my warning. all of you. we're getting the shithead out of here and then we're getting our asses put on blast for having such a serious injury while getting sidetracked. just my luck that my second foray as an exterminator could end *in* termination."" we managed to get the injured one to his feet with his arm around dewl's shoulder, and i scavenged around for our flamethrowers. lav's had a nozzle that was bent from being trampled, rendering it nigh useless. i handed the damaged flamer to caveq, brandishing my own as i approached the beast where it lay wounded. it breathed heavily and seemed to try to kick its feet to gain traction on the ground, but i had gotten it good; it was a goner. ""'fear the predator that doesn't appear so',"" i recited, observing the traits we'd only just moments before attributed to it being prey. despite the creature endangering the lives of me and my crew, i still felt something gnawing from the very deepest pits of my conscience: pity. while it was clearly deserving of death for the danger it posed as a monster, i couldn't help but wonder what kind of life it would've led if it hadn't encountered us. perhaps it would've gone its whole life without killing anyone, or even continued eating grass and minding its business. but that opportunity had passed. before i could change my mind, i once again whipped my pistol out, and planted the remaining ammo into its skull, the animal's body convulsing once more and then never again. once my gun was empty, i holstered it and aimed my flamethrower, setting the carcass ablaze. blackened smoke began rising as the fur turned into ash, and then the acrid stink of the flesh turning to char. the live grass didn't take to the heat, but i still stamped out any stray sparks that i spotted getting a bit too far from the pyre in case it became a more serious matter. when the flame started to die down, i doused the corpse in yet more fire to make sure it was gone, until my fuel indicator read that it was almost empty. forty minutes passed as i stared at the cackling inferno, the smoldering cadaver that was my first kill. one might think you'd feel *something* for taking the life of a living creature, but that feeling never came. twenty more minutes passed, and i wondered where the truck was; we weren't parked *that* far away. i couldn't exactly call them with my holopad as i'd left it in the truck as well as the spare magazine for my gun. i stamped out the embers surrounding the long-gone beast, convinced that the chances of it starting a wildfire were now truly mitigated. the grass around it had turned black, and the rank stench still lingered in the air as i trudged off to find my crew. their job was as simple as getting lav to the truck, and then coming back to pick me up after i'd made sure the corpse wouldn't attract other predators. i worried they decided the ""primitive"" wasn't worth returning for and left me to wander back into town myself. i paused for a moment to massage my legs, sore from all of the walking we'd managed to get done in just a single claw. i walked for what felt like an eternity, certainly more than what i'd walk in the city, and the gear strapped to my body made me regret not just having us drive around in the truck; surely we'd be able to cover more ground like that. i could see the edge of the treeline where we'd left our transportation, though by this point, things started to feel wrong. what was the hold up? surely they felt at least a morsel of gratitude for me dealing with the predator. that's when i caught sight of it: another truck. it wasn't ours, but it seemed to be of venlil design. assuming the others came across some farmers, was *that* why they were held up? i can imagine rural folk would be all too eager to tip off any predatory activity. but as i got closer, things started to get dicier. i saw that the rear passenger-side door of our own vehicle hung askew, the lights on the truck were still on to indicate that the vehicle was idling, wasting gas. and there were voices. deep, predatory, voices. what was being said was indistinguishable from this distance, but i was now certain my crew was in danger, if not already dead. i was only a couple dozen meters from the site as i dropped on all fours, crawling as quietly as i could beneath the tall grass. i used the sounds of predatory chatter to narrow down when i was off course, my whiskers and ears alike assisting to triangulate. my flamethrower was slung across my back and my pistol holstered. my mask hung loosely around my neck as i moved, bumping my snout on occasion as i slinked forward, quietly, slowly. the cloak made little rustles as i crawled, reduced to my kind's basest form to be unseen from all danger, all opposition. ""... killing them is not an option, markus, and i will not discuss the matter further."" my nerves tingled as i picked up on the last bit of conversation. *were they trying to kill them? no, that means they're still alive, there's a chance!* i slowed my progress further so as not to rouse suspicion from the rustling blades of grass. i risked a peek above the waving sod to get my bearings, noting that i was now about ten meters from the truck, getting low again to avoid detection. ""when our boss hears of this, you predators are *finished*!"" that was dewl's voice, shaky and meek. ""when your boss hears of it, it'll be from *you*, understanding what it's like to have your life in the hands of people who hate you. consider it a learning experience, baby burner."" ""what did you do with qitel?"" ""i still don't know who that is, but i'm assuming they'll be here shortly, with richard when he and his posse arrive. now shut up, it tires me being the only one of these guys who understands you."" my translator insisted that the coughing noise i was hearing was laughter, and i picked out at least three voices where it originated from. there was enough space under the truck for me to fit, but that was without a weapon strapped to my back. i'd have to do without anyway, since the fuel might be too low to deal with the threat. quietly, i laid the weapon on the ground. i knew if i could *just* reach for my spare magazine, i might have a fighting chance. i had stored it in the glove compartment, certain i wouldn't need it for such a simple assignment, and so i tried my damndest to avoid making noise as i reached inside of the truck. labored breathing could be heard from the rear driver seat and i spotted lav, conscious and alive, but looking worse for wear. his skin color was a pallid green, though i wasn't certain if that was voluntary or a sign of his overall health. he spotted me, and opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, but decided to keep it shut. his arms were tied up, but he managed to hold out four toes, probably telling me how many there were. i placed a gloved claw to my snout to tell him to not make a sound anyway as i popped open the compartment as slowly as i could. graciously, the hatch came open without a fuss, and i quickly looted the spare ammo. i got back on all fours, giving lav an ear signal of encouragement as i exited the cabin. ""i'd still like it if we could just like… shave 'em or something."" ""as great of an idea as that is, no."" ""tar and feather?"" ""no."" ""gibbet?"" ""i'm going to keep answering 'no'."" ""c'mon, the gibbet isn't even that bad. just like, point and laugh at them for three weeks and they'll learn their lesson."" ""yusef, can you tell this man 'no' for me?"" ""he said 'no',"" a third voice grumbled, somewhere off to the left. i now had the locations of three of the predators mapped out as i crawled under the truck, reapplying my mask so that it wasn't in the way. i could spot the predators brandishing crude weapons over my teammates, the other exterminators sitting with their legs crossed and their arms behind their heads. my mapping was spot-on with where the three that i'd heard were, though i couldn't spot the fourth that lav had warned me about. i supposed i'd have to figure that out as i went. i loaded the gun while preparing myself for the fight, my heart rate steadily rising as i was uncertain how this would go. i tenderly chambered a round, my weapon now primed for the fight. i took aim. ""*qitel, look out!*"" lav had called out against all better judgment, but before i could berate him, i felt something wrap around my ankle, tugging me backwards. my head bashed against the drive shaft of the truck and my vision went blurry as i became disoriented from the change in surroundings. i whirled around to find the fourth predator had found me. i raised my pistol in an attempt to deal with them, but with dizzying strength, they began overpowering me. the beast had their claws wrapped around my wrists, trying to wrestle the gun from my grasp, and i tried to twist my paw as far as i could to get a shot. i squeezed the trigger, and one shot popped off into the air without any noticeable effect. the human's grip grew tighter around my wrist and i gritted my teeth in pain. holding on to the gun was getting harder. ""drop it,"" the alien growled. ""before this gets *real* nasty."" i growled back in defiance, even as the pain from the beast's grip began to travel up to my elbow. i couldn't surrender, or i'd have failed my team. ""have it your way."" the last thing i recalled was the terran's face lunging forward, a painful, bright light, and then darkness. &#x200b; *and here, we conclude part 1 of qitel's debut, part 2 is tbd at a later date, but rest assured that it will be soon. hopefully.* &#x200b; \[ [first]( LINK / [previous]( LINK / next \]",NatureofPredators,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/16eylut/the_spirit_of_a_predator_chapter_14_a_walk/,0

16ey09g,title: puerto ricans in space presents crown jewel heights,"**chapter 2 - a mysterious proposition** **crown jewel heights** holodisk noir series a chatgpt story certainly, let's structure the narrative into chapters to help keep track of the story's progression. here's a proposed breakdown of the chapters for our holodisk noir: **chapter 1 - calamity's dawn** **chapter 2 - a mysterious proposition** **chapter 3 - the icy web unraveled** **chapter 4 - a twist of fate** **chapter 5 - traces of deception** **chapter 6 - unsettling revelation** **chapter 7 - echoes of deceit** **chapter 8 - silent echoes** **chapter 9 - whispers of fate** **chapter 10 - unveiling the diamond** **chapter 11 - unmasking the corruption** **chapter 12 - rediscovering home** **chapter 13 - seeking serenity** **chapter 14 - reclaiming the moon** **chapter 15 - unraveling the enigma** **chapter 16 - unveiling the truth** **chapter 17 - fractured reclamation** **chapter 18 - confrontation and resolutions** **chapter 19 - finding peace** **chapter 2 - a mysterious proposition** in the modern day, the sun began its arc in ascension over the horizon, casting a feeble light onto the aftermath of destruction that sprawled across the once-vibrant city blocks. titan plaza on alderney island, once a bustling complex, now lay in ruins, a chaotic heap of debris and devastation. it had been the epicenter of commerce that had been struck brutally with force, the plaza was reduced to a twisted mess of steel and concrete. as the first rays of dawn kissed the wreckage that marked revolution, the scene revealed itself in stark contrast - a stark testament to the power of a new technology in destruction. smoke and ash billowed, caught in the glimmers of the rising sun, forming a haunting silhouette against the sky. the wreckage burned along the river bank path, oil seeping into the river, its grim display stretching for miles, a morbid exhibit of man-made catastrophe. amid the chaos, solemn figure's sense emerged from the rubble, rising from the debris in devastation. the hand of a woman whose identity was unrecognizable from the debris. a man who's face was etched carried her palm with grim determination, a mixture of sorrow and anger marred his features. as onlookers gazed in horror, their expressions mirrored the man's anguish. panic spread like wildfire, and the collective grimace of the crowd mirrored his scowl. but the man's strength faltered, and he collapsed amidst the pool of corpses parts, his body melded wreckage with the horror that echoed and surrounded him, a chilling echo of the tragedy and the foe. just then, the sky was pierced by a barrage of bullets, a deadly rain of gunfire from above. black hawk helicopters, dispatched by an as yet unidentified enemy, swept through the air with deadly precision, mowing down the terrified crowd with ruthless efficiency. the at once-panicked onlookers now screamed in terror, their desperate cries mingling with the chilling cacophony of the ruthless assault. among the chaos, the woman to whom the hand belonged was now nowhere to be seen. her absence a haunting reminder of the desolation and devastation that had occurred. in the midst of that unfolding, the man's eyes flashed with a steely resolve. there was a purpose, a determination burned steadfast within him. he knew that the only way to make sense of this calamity, to seek justice for the lives lost, was to unravel the webs of secret and lies no doubt that had brought about this catastrophe. a public having a gripe with terror and the woman to whom the hand belonged about displayed in stride apart.",hdfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/hdfidelity/comments/16ey09g/title_puerto_ricans_in_space_presents_crown_jewel/,0

16ex79j,the maui fires may be a beginning point of something drastic...,"so, at this point we can all agree that the sudden fires that spread across the island of maui was not the unfortunate act of mother nature by way of climate change. the government/wealthy elites clearly seem to have profited by the vast areas of scorched landscape that now can be 'legally' purchased, which really only leaves a person/family that isn't incredibly wealthy almost zero chance to reclaim and rebuild their properties and lives. now, just to name a few of several and i mean several oddities that have come to light since the fires occurred. one being how you see a car absolutely torched to the extreme, even melted aluminum becoming a gluey texture, yet right next to the car surrounding it is green grass and the ashpalt underneath the vehicle, not even a slight sign of that having endured any type of an excessive heat index. this is all over!... my point if it's not already clear, ""wildfires"" or so what it's being attributed to, don't leave such anomalous occurrences behind that suggest this wasn't a fire of uncontrolled spread, but quite the opposite actually, appearing to have a very precise and controllable burn target. if anyone has not heard of d.e.w. being what is more than likely the cause, and action being perpetrated by high ranking government officials/superior rankikg military...? regardless, it's the control causing pain and torture to us, the everyday lac's. directed energy weapons is what dew stands for and this technology is very next level and to me, it's no question this wasn't an 'act of god' now, my theory of what this could all mean, is this. the decision makers at the heads of government know it's only a short matter of time before a revolution happens, especially if things as fishy as what occurred in hawaii start to happen more occasional. they know if we attempt to overthrow the position of power and authority they hold, they wont stand a chance. but they don't plan to stop, noooo...they plan to evacuate and prosper alone on an island away from all of us. oprah and zuck, just to name a couple, have been buying up mad land throughout hawaii recently and it's no coincidence. they plan to give us the ""controll"" of government, but really it's an another farce. it's just another illusion. they plan to take full control and authority over the hawaiian islands and live there happy and unbothered, at least if they are attempted at being bothered, they have a very fool-proof plan to avoid being surprised. they can see threats miles away and happen to have these intense laser weapons that can instantaneously fry a point of attack so precise that little to no excess area will be consumed by immense fires being casued from far away. this island also is a benefit to them as they can basically human traffic as often as they want and be secretive while doing it. i'm telling y'all, they gunna take up hawaii and let the power grids go down, and watch chaos erupt on the mainland from afar. we potentially are about to be full on prisoners to this country and anyone trying to leave by boat or plane, their weaponry is so advanced and elite, we are not going to be successful in just leaving the country. they will offer us by price to other countries like actual slaves as this is probably their only way to try and erase the debt to other countries by selling our freedom. i dont know, i know this might be waayyy out there, but i don't know. just pray i'm dead wrong and either way, start learning how to grow vegetable, obtain survival tactics and things like that. never know when you might be 100% on your own...",conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16ex79j/the_maui_fires_may_be_a_beginning_point_of/,0
16ex4v1,cersei's fate and other endings foreshadowed in the forsaken (spoilers extended),"# summary - tldr in the forsaken, twow, aeron dreams of the following: >**he saw his brother on the iron throne again**, but euron was no longer human. ... beside him stood a shadow in woman’s form, long and tall and *terrible*, **her hands alive with pale white fire**. ***dwarves*** ***capered*** **for** ***their*** **amusement**, **male and female**, **naked** and misshapen, locked in carnal embrace, **biting and tearing** at each other as euron and his mate **laughed and laughed and laughed** … when comparing cersei's chapters and the forsaken (specifically cersei's dream in cersei i affc and her walk of atonement in adwd) there are obvious and clear parallels between the two, with specific language mirroring. for example, the parallels in cersei's affc dream suggest she is the woman in aeron's dream as euron's mate is cersei: >**she dreamt she sat the iron throne**, high above them all. the *courtiers were brightly colored mice* below. great **lords and** proud **ladies** knelt before her. bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. until the **dwarf** appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and **howling with laughter**. the **lords and ladies** began to chuckle too, **hiding their smiles behind their hand**s. only then did the queen realize **she was** **naked**. > >horrified, **she tried to** ***cover*** **herself** with ***her hands***. the ***barbs and blades*** of **the iron throne** ***bit*** **into her flesh** as she crouched to hide her shame. ***blood*** **ran red down her legs**, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. when she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the ***twisted*** metal. the more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, ***tearing*** **chunks of flesh** from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening. and all the while **her brother capered below, laughing**. - *cersei i, affc* further parallels between the forsaken and the chapters with cersei's dream in affc and her walk of atonement suggest the following: * cersei will defeat the high sparrow and the faith militant with wildfire. * cersei will subsequently rise to power as queen in her own right. * cersei and euron will form an alliance that involves marriage. * the cersei/euron duo will be successful in defeating enemies initially. * dany is the younger and more beautiful queen. * cersei/euron duo will succumb to dany/tyrion duo following the burning of kings landing. * jamie (or possibly euron) is the valonquar. * euron has greenseer abilities/was visited by the three eyed raven. # 1. aeron's vs cersei's dreams - identity of the shadow in woman's form the woman is cersei. there are numerous parallels in the wording used to describe aeron's dream in the forsaken with cersei's dream in her first chapter in affc. to illustrate, i will highlight the key bits in bold: **1. aeron:** >he saw the longships of the ironborn adrift and burning on a boiling blood-red sea. **he saw his brother on the iron throne again**, but euron was no longer human. he seemed more squid than man, a monster fathered by a kraken of the deep, his face a mass of writhing tentacles. beside him stood a **shadow** **in woman’s form**, **long and tall and** ***terrible***, **her hands alive** with **pale white fire**. **dwarves** ***capered*** **for** ***their*** **amusement**, **male and female**, **naked and misshapen**, locked in carnal embrace, **biting and** **tearing** at each other as euron and his mate **laughed and laughed and laughed** … **2. cersei:** >**she dreamt she sat the iron throne**, high above them all. the *courtiers were brightly colored mice* below. great **lords and** proud **ladies** knelt before her. bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. until the **dwarf** appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and **howling with laughter**. the **lords and ladies** began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. only then did the queen realize **she was** **naked**. > >horrified, **she tried to** ***cover*** **herself** with ***her hands***. the ***barbs and blades*** of **the iron throne** ***bit*** **into her flesh** as she crouched to hide her shame. ***blood*** **ran red down her legs**, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. when she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the ***twisted*** metal. the more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, ***tearing*** **chunks of flesh** from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening. and all the while **her brother capered below, laughing**. - *cersei i, affc* so in summary we have the following parallels: * a woman dreaming of sitting the iron throne, and a man dreaming of his brother doing same * literal and symbolic references to biting and tearing * male and female, lords and ladies * dwarves capering for euron and his mate's amusement, a dwarf capering below cersei laughing * references to ""naked"" - cersei realises she is naked, and ""misshapen"", cersei is cut up by the iron throne if you look elsewhere in the forsaken, there are some further parallels: * dwarves capering in aeron's first dream: >clad head to heel in scale as dark as onyx, he sat upon a mound of blackened skulls as **dwarfs capered** round his feet and a forest burned behind him. * how the iron throne is described in aeron's first dream is similar to how it is described in cersei's: >now it was metal underneath the crow’s eye: a great, tall, ***twisted*** seat of razor sharp iron, **barbs and blades** and broken swords, **all dripping blood.** * compare cersei's and aeron's thoughts immediately following their first dream: >it was **only a dream, a vision born of foul black wine**. - *the forsaken, twow* > >a dream, that’s all it was, a dream. i drank too much last night, **these fears are only humors born of wine**. i will be the one laughing, come dusk. - *cersei i, affc* * both are visited by their ""little brother"" holding a lantern - this is probably one of the clearest examples of evidence for jamie (or even euron if factoring in the context here) as the valonqar - she has dreamt of tyrion coming to kill her, but the other will do it: >and a few days later, as her hull shuddered in the grip of some storm, the crow’s eye came below again, **lantern in hand**. this time his other hand held a dagger. “still praying, priest? your god has forsaken you.” - *the forsaken, twow* > >her bedchamber was dark, **but for the lantern one of the intruders held on high**. i must show no fear. cersei pushed back sleep-tousled hair, and said, “what do you want of me?” a man stepped into the lantern light, and she saw his cloak was white. **“jaime?” i dreamt of one brother, but the other has come to wake me.** \- *cersei i, affc* * the pale white flame - connecting cersei (wildfire) with the drowned god: >all gods are lies, but yours is laughable. **a** **pale white thing** in the likeness of a man, his limbs broken and swollen and his hair flipping in the water while fish nibble at his face. what fool would worship that? as for ""brightly colored courtiers"", i couldn't find any direct parallels with the forsaken, but note: * from sam v, asos that could suggest brightly coloured means flames/fire: >steel scraped against wood and leather, and radiance filled the solar; shimmering, shifting, a dance of gold and orange and red light, **all the bright colors of fire**. * from cersei viii, affc that could suggest the seven colours of the faith militant (again, could be a double meaning with fire): >the new high septon—or high sparrow, as moon boy had dubbed him—did everything by sevens. the knights wore swordbelts striped in the seven **color**s of the faith. crystals adorned the pommels of their longswords and the crests of their greathelms. they carried kite shields of a style not common since the conquest, displaying a device not seen in the seven kingdoms for centuries: a **rainbow sword shining** **bright** upon a field of darkness. # 2. parallels between cersei's walk of atonement and the forsaken there are also many parallels between cersei's walk of atonement in cersei ii, adwd, and aeron being taken to be strapped to the prow of the silence. for example (non-exhaustive, but if you compare side by side the chapters are riddled with mirroring): * both cry as they start to ascend: >when they pulled him up the steps through the light, he felt its warmth upon his face, and tears rolled down his cheeks. - *the forsaken, twow* > >and then there was no stopping the tears. they burned down the queen’s cheeks like acid. cersei gave a sharp cry - *cersei ii, adwd* * bright, terrible, beautiful, golden - parallel between joffrey and cersei: >the light was too bright to look upon, and aeron was afraid of what it meant. ***bright*** **and** ***terrible***. ... ... it was only a slit in the stone, a bare hand’s breadth across, but that was wide enough to admit a shaft of sunlight. **so** **golden**, the damphair thought, **so beautiful**. - *the forsaken, twow* > >and **there was** ***joff*** as well, her son, her firstborn, **her** ***beautiful*** ***bright*** **boy** with **his** ***golden*** **curls** and his sweet smile, he had such lovely lips, he … - *cersei ii, adwd* * both hurt their feet during their walk: >his feet banged off the steps as they ascended, sending stabbing pains up his leg. he bit his lips to keep from crying out. - *the forsaken, twow* > >her heel came down on something sharp, a stone or piece of broken crockery. cersei cried out in pain. - *cersei ii, adwd* * cersei is greeted by kevan, qyburn, robert strong et al at the end of her walk and aeron at the end of his by euron's captains. # 3. the forsaken - pairing between cersei and euron if the woman in aeron's dream is cersei, the forsaken also foreshadows a pairing between cersei and euron, likely in marriage. other examples are: * euron is said to be taking both a salt wife and a *rock* wife, which will be a queen of westeros - cersei is heir to the rock, and already a queen. >i’m to be euron’s salt wife, but he must have **a** ***rock*** **wife** too, ***a queen to rule all westeros at his side***. * aeron thinks: >""most captains kept the ***lion’s*** **share** of their plunder but euron took almost nothing for himself."" * cersei thinks the man with the lantern is jamie - her younger brother. euron, aeron's younger brother, visits aeron with a lantern. * if we assume euron's reference to visiting aeron's bed chamber is as sinister as it sounds, there is also the incest parallel too. # 4. foreshadowing of other endings in the forsaken both aeron's dream of euron and his mate, and cersei's dream in her first affc chapter are clearly depicting the same events. however, in cersei's, the circumstances change when tyrion shows up and he starts laughing at her. given that tyrion isn't privy to her walk of atonement (e.g. cersei being naked), he is obviously going to turn up again so he can point and laugh at her. we know that tyrion will join up with dany in a significant way. **1.** **dany as the younger and more beautiful queen** dany is clearly the younger and more beautiful queen coming to take all cersei holds dear. the evidence for this is in cersei's vision of maggy the frog during her walk, coupled with her self-affirmations about her beauty throughout. when contrasted with falia's description of dany, the connection can be clearly established: >*words are wind, she thought, words cannot hurt me.* ***i am beautiful***\*,\* ***the most beautiful woman in all westeros***\*, jaime says so, jaime would never lie to me. even robert, robert never loved me, but he saw that i was beautiful, he wanted me. ...\* > >and suddenly the hag was there ... *“****queen you shall be****,”* she hissed, *“****until there comes another****,* ***younger and more beautiful,*** *to cast you down and take all you hold most dear.”* \- *cersei ii, adwd* > >**they say she’s the most beautiful woman in the world**, and she has dragons. the two of us will be as close as sisters!” - *the forsaken, twow* note that cersei caveats her beauty standard to westeros, whereas dany is obviously in essos. i think this suggests that there will be a dany/cersei showdown that will end in cersei's demise and tyrion ""laughing"" at her. it would also make sense with the overwhelming number of parallels between the two women (i won't go into that now). **2. aeron's first dream of euron** an additional observation is the following passage from the forsaken - aeron's first dream of euron: >when he laughed his face sloughed off and the priest saw that it was not urri but euron, the smiling eye hidden. **he showed the world** **his blood eye** now, dark and terrible. clad head to heel in **scale as dark as onyx**, he **sat upon a mound of blackened skulls** as dwarfs capered round his feet and **a forest burned behind him**. > >**“the bleeding star bespoke the end,” he said to aeron. “these are the last days, when the world shall be broken and remade.** a new god shall be born from the graves and charnel pits.” then **euron lifted a great horn to his lips and blew,** and **dragons** and krakens and sphinxes came at his command and bowed before him. “kneel, brother,” the crow’s eye commanded. “i am your king, i am your god. worship me, and i will raise you up to be my priest.” > >“never. no godless man may sit the seastone chair!” > >**“why would i want that hard black rock? brother, look again and see where i am seated.”** > >aeron damphair looked. **the mound of skulls was gone.** now it was metal underneath the crow’s eye: a great, tall, twisted seat of razor sharp iron, barbs and blades and broken swords, all dripping blood. i subscribe to the theory that multiple characters have been visited by the three eyed raven (e.g. patchface), including euron. with that in mind, my take on this is: * euron is appearing to aeron in his dream, not because it is him that is the subject of the dream, but because he is showing aeron the future using his **blood eye** \- ""he *showed* the world with his *blood eye""*: >""are you the three-eyed crow?"" bran heard himself say. a three-eyed crow should have three eyes. **he has only one, and that one red**. **bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the torchlight**. where his other eye should have been, a thin white root grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck. - bran ii, adwd * aeron mistakes euron as being the subject of the vision and therefore thinks that the seat is the seastone chair - hence why euron says ""look again"". aeron is then shown a vision where euron *is* the subject of it - one where he is sitting the iron throne. we can therefore deduce the vision shown through euron's blood eye will happen. so, what could it be? i think it is dany and the aftermath of the burning of kings landing: * ""scale as dark as onyx"" - drogon * ""sat upon a mound of blackened skulls"" - state of iron throne after kings landing has burned * ""dwarfs capered round his feet"" - tyrion as dany's hand * ""a forest burned behind him"" - burning of kings landing there are many passages in the texts that support the above, but here are some examples below from dany's chapters: >**bones they were**, broken bones and **blackened**. the longer ones had been cracked open for their marrow. ""**it were the black one**,"" the man said, in a ghiscari growl, ""**the winged shadow**. he come down from the sky and … and …"" - *dany i, adwd* > >""**let him be king over charred bones** and cooked meat,"" he said to a man below him. ""**let him be the king of ashes**."" **drogon shrieked**, his claws digging through silk and skin, but the king on his throne never heard, and dany moved on. - *dany's vision in the house of the undying in dany iv, acok* > >the **air smelled of ash,** every rock and tree in sight was **scorched and blackened**, the ground strewn with **burned and broken bones**, **yet it had been home to him**. ***dany knew the lure of home***\*\*.\*\* - *drogon's lair, dany x, adwd* > >""it is such a long way,"" she complained. ""i was tired, jorah. i was weary of war. **i wanted to** rest, to laugh, to **plant trees and see them grow.** i am only a young girl."" no. you are the blood of the dragon. the whispering was growing fainter, as if ser jorah were falling farther behind. **dragons** **plant** **no** **trees**. remember that. remember who you are, what you were made to be. remember your words. ""fire and blood,"" daenerys told the swaying grass. - *dany x, adwd* # conclusions the forsaken is doing three main things: 1. foreshadowing the outcome of cersei's trial and the downfall of the faith militant 2. foreshadowing euron and cersei pairing up 3. foreshadowing future events **connection between aeron and cersei** * aeron is both cersei and the high sparrow here. likewise, euron is also cersei and jamie here. * ultimately, aeron's chapter describes the end of him, whereas cersei's arc appears to mirror his, but actually symbolises that her rise to power is only just beginning. * cersei using her ""hands"", which are hands alive with pale white fire, to ""cover"" herself suggests that she will use wildfire to bring down the faith militant - i.e destroying the drowned god: >and there, swollen and green, half-devoured by crabs, the drowned god festered with the rest, seawater still dripping from his hair. * aeron is foreshadowing cersei as being ""terrible"", noting the parallel to joffrey * the fate of the priests/sorcerers/warlocks aboard the silence foreshadows the fate of the faith militant, particularly the septons and the significance of the mute (ungregor) in aeron's chapter - e.g: >***one septon made a frightened noise*** ***as the*** ***mute undid his chains***, a half-choked sound that might have been some attempt at speech. (i imagine we will get a mirrored chapter of ungregor and septa unella, but he won't be undoing his ""chains"") **connection between euron and cersei and future events** * the forsaken is setting up a pairing between euron and cersei. cersei is clearly the woman in aeron's dream and she will sit the iron throne with euron as her partner. * cersei confusing the man with the lantern as jamie suggests that euron will be the one to ""save"" her. * the reference to euron having a *rock* wife suggests that a marriage pact will be formed between him and cersei. * both versions of cersei's and aeron's dreams will come true. euron and cersei will be laughing at first - the dwarves they are laughing at are symbolic here (think the beautiful woman from dany's hotu vision). whereas tyrion - the literal dwarf - who will be on dany's side, will be ultimately laughing when dany lays waste to kl. * aeron's first dream of euron sitting on a mound of blackened skulls is foreshadowing dany taking kings landing after it burns. * euron and cersei will fall to dany and tyrion in a final showdown that results in kings landing burning. if you've made it this far, thanks for reading!! edit - revised the tldr section and removed intro to make it more easy to read",asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16ex4v1/cerseis_fate_and_other_endings_foreshadowed_in/,0
16ex46v,[waybound] steel dragon’s mountain,"we hear about this path in both reaper and waybound. we meet a hunger echo of a herald of steel dragon mountain, and we find out that two sages of steel dragon’s mountain created blighted sky, a spear made from a remnant of an unknown monarch and “the rarest of materials.” now obviously blighted sky’s “plague made of wildfire” effect from it’s striker technique would be a function of the monarch remnant used and the materials it was made of, rather than the path of steel dragon’s mountain, but it’s still a mark of their impressive skill. their goldsign appears to be a third eye hovering over their heads, but it could equally have been a heraldsign. what do we all think? force madra is definitely a component, maybe earth as well, but we just don’t know.",Iteration110Cradle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iteration110Cradle/comments/16ex46v/waybound_steel_dragons_mountain/,0

16etzb5,like there's no tomorrow (part 2),"the walls of çatalhöyük, thick and studded with remnants from past battles, told stories of resilience and defiance. as the sun’s rays pierced through the interstices of the city's outer defenses, ella stood deep in thought, tracing a particularly jagged scar on the barrier with her fingertips. it was a scar left by an alien weapon during one of their earlier attempts to breach the city, a reminder of just how fragile their sanctuary could be. beside her, mcgraw, a tower of a man with broad shoulders and an air of undeniable authority, bellowed instructions. he directed a determined group of survivors in placing freshly made barricades. some were rudimentary, made of salvaged metal and wood, while others were more sophisticated, showing signs of evolving human ingenuity in the face of an interstellar threat. ella, lost in the repetitive motion of her task, felt the weight of years of conflict bearing down on her. the gravity of their situation found a voice in her as she turned to mcgraw. “do you ever wonder, amidst all this, what we're truly fighting for? beyond the day-to-day, beyond just surviving?” mcgraw paused, contemplating his response. “every single day, ella,” he admitted, his voice softer now. “we’re fighting for the world we once knew, for the memories of those we’ve lost, and for a hope - faint as it may be - that the kids here might have a different future.” rodrigo, an engineer by trade before the war and now responsible for much of the city's makeshift weaponry, joined in. as he tightened a bolt on one of their recently devised catapults, he remarked, “it’s also about legacy. if we give up now, what stories will the survivors tell? we’re the last bastion of humanity, and çatalhöyük is our alamo.” ella's gaze roved over the defenses, the people working diligently, each lost in their roles but united in purpose. “i just wish there was an end, a resolution, not just for us, but for the generations after. a true light at the end of this endless, darkened tunnel.”mcgraw, placing a reassuring arm around ella, said, “there's always light, even if it's a mere glimmer. we just have to keep pushing towards it.” as the two continued their tasks, a sense of anticipation coursed through the city. mira, a young scout known for her agility and keen senses, raced towards them, a mixture of excitement and apprehension evident in her eyes. “word’s spreading like wildfire. the council's called a meeting – a big one. they're saying the president himself will address the entire city.” the news hung heavily in the air. meetings of this magnitude were rare. mcgraw mused, “at the heart of çatalhöyük, in the courtyard? it’s serious, then.”ella looked between mira and mcgraw, her brows furrowed. “it's not like the council to call such a public address. what could be so pressing?” before mcgraw could reply, mira interjected, her voice hushed, “rumors say it's about a new strategy, a possible turning point.” mcgraw nodded slowly, then turned to ella with a purposeful gaze. “there's something else, ella. i've been given the privilege to honor you during this gathering. your tireless efforts, your leadership – they haven’t gone unnoticed. they're speaking of a promotion, an elevation to a higher rank.” the revelation hit ella like a tidal wave. “why me? i've only done what any of us would have.” mcgraw’s laugh echoed warmly amidst the cold metal surroundings. “that's where you're wrong. you're the heart of this resistance. the beacon guiding us through our darkest nights.” feeling overwhelmed, ella's thoughts raced to her family. “i need to prepare, to talk to my parents. they should hear this from me.” “of course,” mcgraw said, understanding in his eyes. “we'll keep things running here. you go find your family.” with thoughts swirling, ella began to traverse the intricate labyrinth of tunnels and corridors towards her home. the gravity of the upcoming event, the honor, the responsibility – she needed the grounding presence of her parents to make sense of it all. navigating the depths of the city was an experience in itself. ella began her descent from the bustling upper sectors, where the day-to-day activities of trade, planning, and fortifications took place. as she moved downward, the atmosphere subtly shifted. the distant echoes of footsteps and conversations were gradually replaced by the serene humming of the city's internal machinery. the middle layers showcased the ingenuity of çatalhöyük's inhabitants. here, farms thrived under artificial lights, mimicking sunlight. further down, water purification systems gurgled, a testament to human innovation in the direst of circumstances. pockets of communal areas appeared sporadically, where children played under the watchful eyes of their elders and murals painted on the walls depicted scenes from a bygone era - a silent reminder of the world before the invasion. the deeper ella went, the more personal the spaces became. handcrafted ornaments decorated doorways, and faint melodies from age-old lullabies wafted through the corridors. this was the heart of çatalhöyük, where families sought solace in the embrace of their loved ones, and where memories were cherished and passed down through generations. finally, reaching the lowest level, the door to her family’s dwelling stood before her. inside, the warm glow of candles greeted her. mark, meticulously cleaning drone parts, looked up and smiled, while sarah, with the gentle precision of a seasoned nurse, prepared medical supplies. their recent heroics in the drone-led offense were still the talk of the city. “you're back early,” mark noted. ""how are our defenses holding up?"" “they're solid,” ella began, pausing to collect her thoughts. ""but there's news. mcgraw mentioned an honor for me at the council's gathering."" sarah, her face a mix of surprise and pride, queried, “an honor? what have you been up to now?” “it’s for our collective efforts,” ella replied. “mcgraw believes the time has come.”nodding, mark commented, ""recognition in these times can be significant. but remember, it's the cause we fight for, not the accolades."" sarah added, “every victory, every acknowledgment, it's all part of our narrative. a testament to our resilience and hope."" ella, absorbing their wisdom, responded, ""your stories, your strength; they're the foundation on which i stand. they guide me in our shared battle for humanity’s future."" mark set down the drone component he had been cleaning and looked at ella with those deep-set eyes that had seen so much. “you know,” he began, leaning back in his chair, “when your mother and i first arrived here, çatalhöyük wasn't the fortress it is today. we helped build it, piece by piece, turning it into the haven it has become. an honor from the council is a recognition of effort, determination, and sacrifice. it’s a testament to the fact that no matter how bleak the odds, humanity finds a way.” sarah, her fingers deftly organizing medical supplies, chimed in, “we have witnessed both the city’s and our family’s evolution. through every challenge, through every trial, we’ve emerged stronger, adapting and innovating. this honor for you, ella, is a beacon for the younger generation, signaling that the flame of resistance burns bright.” ella absorbed their words, feeling the weight of generations and the legacy she was inheriting. “your tales, both of triumph and loss, have shaped me,” she admitted. “it’s a daunting responsibility to step into such large footprints, but knowing i have your guidance makes it less overwhelming.” sarah moved closer, cupping ella’s face. “sweetheart, while we’ve been through battles, you represent the hope of not just our family but the entire city. you’ve earned every bit of this honor, not just as our daughter, but as a valiant defender of çatalhöyük.” “the road ahead won’t be easy,” mark warned, his tone somber yet hopeful. “the enemy is relentless. but i believe in you, in us, in our city. and if history has shown us anything, it’s that we, as a people, rise when faced with adversity.” ella nodded, steeling herself for the challenges ahead. “i’ll carry your teachings with me, always. i hope to make you both proud, to further our legacy, and ensure çatalhöyük remains a beacon of hope in this darkened world.” the trio shared a heartfelt moment, aware of the looming threat outside, yet confident in the unity and resilience that bound them together. as the hours dwindled before the council's gathering, they cherished the rare moments of peace, drawing strength from each other, ready to face whatever the future held. the sprawling courtyard at the heart of çatalhöyük pulsed with expectant energy. assembled residents—from playful children laughing under the watchful eyes of their guardians, to engineers passionately discussing upcoming projects, farmers exchanging harvest stories, and decorated warriors reflecting on battles—were keenly awaiting the evening's central event. a distinctive figure began to make his way to the front. president ronald wade, at the age of 57, had a presence that was instantly commanding. with a full mane of silver hair, and facial features that bore both the sophistication of a successful businessman and the resilience of a wartime leader, he looked a decade younger than his years. before the invasion, he'd been a force to reckon with in the business world, and now, he was the beacon of hope for çatalhöyük. drawing the crowd's attention effortlessly, he spoke with a voice that resonated both warmth and authority. ""esteemed residents of çatalhöyük,"" he commenced, ""history has its epochs—moments that not only challenge and inspire but also carve our legacy. today, we are the authors of such an epoch.” ""for nearly a decade, as our world underwent unimaginable changes, çatalhöyük emerged as our fortress, our emblem of resilience and hope. the intricate tunnels we navigate and our towering walls are not just shields; they are the embodiment of our shared determination and spirit.” president wade's gaze, insightful and appreciative, moved across the crowd, ensuring every soul felt seen and honored. “during such pivotal times, it's from our very essence that heroes are born. their acts of bravery, their sacrifices, and their indomitable spirit guide and inspire us all. the recent victory we celebrated is evidence of such heroism and collective strength.” collecting himself, he added, ""to the forces that challenge us, let our message be crystal clear: çatalhöyük's spirit is unbowed and unbroken. we stand united, a testament to human innovation, resilience, and unyielding will.” with reverence in his tone, he declared, “this evening, in this great assembly, we spotlight those whose actions have been nothing short of extraordinary. to introduce and champion one of our brightest stars, it's my privilege to call upon captain mcgraw.” captain mcgraw stepped forward, his tall stature and broad shoulders cutting an impressive figure against the backdrop. the myriad scars and marks on his hands bore testament to countless battles fought, but his posture radiated the elegance of years in leadership. with a respectful nod to president wade, he addressed the assembly. ""citizens of çatalhöyük,"" he began, his voice steady, ""in the theater of war, amongst the cacophony and chaos, certain individuals rise to the occasion. their actions, insights, and unwavering commitment to their comrades stand out, making them the fulcrum around which the fate of many pivots."" the courtyard grew silent, every resident hanging on to his every word, anticipating what was to come. ""in our recent engagement, when our backs were against the wall and our defenses pressed hard from the trenches,"" mcgraw paused, emphasizing the dire nature of the situation, ""a beacon arose. with a keen eye for strategy and an undaunted spirit, one individual's swift decisions and commands became the keystone of our success.""his gaze roamed the crowd before settling on ella. ""ella,"" he intoned, pride evident in his voice, ""your exceptional tactical acumen, your courage, and your ability to lead when it mattered most have not only preserved countless lives but also secured us a pivotal victory."" the applause from the crowd was immediate and deafening, as ella, blushing with a mix of pride and surprise, stepped forward. ""today,"" mcgraw continued, holding up a radiant medal that caught the courtyard's light, ""i am privileged to present this medal as a testament to your exceptional valor and to recognize your well-deserved promotion. your actions have cemented a revered place in the legacy of çatalhöyük."" as captain mcgraw draped the medal around ella's neck, the atmosphere surged with joy and admiration. ella, moved by the moment, saluted captain mcgraw, president wade, and then the gathered residents of çatalhöyük, their applause echoing the triumphant sentiment of the day. ella's heart raced as she felt the weight of the medal around her neck. it wasn't just the physical medal, but the weight of responsibility, hope, and expectations it represented. her eyes scanned the crowd, recognizing many faces that had fought alongside her, some showing visible wounds, while others bore internal scars from the relentless war. all of them shared a moment of hope and pride, a rare respite from the struggles that lay outside the city walls. president wade and captain mcgraw exchanged a glance, mutual respect evident in their eyes. both had seen their fair share of battles and understood the importance of these ceremonies. in the midst of relentless conflict, moments of unity and celebration were essential. they provided the hope, the drive to push forward, even when the future seemed bleak. the gathered residents began to disperse slowly, their conversations animated, echoing tales of bravery, memories of the battle, and hope for the days to come. ella was surrounded by a group of soldiers and residents, each wanting to congratulate her, to share a word or a story. she listened and smiled, accepting their well wishes, but her mind was somewhere else. her thoughts were with those who hadn't made it back, the friends and comrades whose sacrifices had made moments like this possible. as the courtyard gradually emptied, mark and sarah approached ella, their pride evident. ""you've done well,"" mark whispered, his voice thick with emotion. sarah, tears shimmering in her eyes, hugged her daughter tightly, wordlessly conveying her love and pride. the sun cast a golden hue across the city, making everything seem a touch more radiant. for a moment, the world seemed a little brighter, the burdens a little lighter.ella, medal shining on her chest, looked up at the sunlight and then back at her parents. together, hand in hand, they began the journey back to the depths of the city, their hearts filled with renewed hope and purpose. as they descended, the echoing footsteps resonated within the vast city corridors. every step taken, every battle won, was a testament to their resilience. the route to their home was one they had traversed countless times, navigating through the sprawling underground city to the deep levels reserved for living quarters. for ella, mark, and sarah, home was more than a place—it was an anchor, a respite from the challenges above ground. their bond, solidified not just by blood but by the shared reality of war, was unspoken yet evident in every glance and gesture. together, they navigated a world reshaped by conflict, each day bringing its own set of challenges, but also moments of quiet strength. inside their home, the ambient light from the luminescent panels cast a soft glow over the living space. the familiar scent and surroundings provided an immediate sense of calm. the trio settled in, each finding their own space to reflect and relax. as the hours waned, the events of the day began to feel distant, almost like a dream. in this sanctuary, they were reminded of the reasons they fought so hard: for family, for home, for hope. with that thought, the weariness of the day gave way to a restful night, preparing them for whatever the next chapter of their journey held.",HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16etzb5/like_theres_no_tomorrow_part_2/,0

16et1ip,portland mountain biking has been decimated," when i first relocated to portland, i was eager to experience its reputation as a ""bike-friendly"" city. however, i was puzzled to discover that this pro-bike spirit seemed not to extend to mountain biking. while portland boasts a number of accessible urban bike lanes, the trails for mountain biking enthusiasts are surprisingly scarce. in the short span since my arrival, several of these trails have disappeared. the clear cutting at rocky point, the closure of the mt. hood downhill area, and the upcoming clear cutting in the yacolt forest have significantly reduced the limited mountain biking locations. presently, our community faces an added challenge with the sandy wildfire closures. now, places like post canyon and a few other spots remain, but even these are an hour or more away from the city, and that's on a good traffic day. several pressing questions arise from this scenario: 1. **the contradiction**: how can a city, which proudly advertises its pro-biking, outdoorsy, and ecotourism ethos, simultaneously resist mountain biking? 2. **space for mountain biking**: with the city's rich geographical backdrop, especially in its western region, why hasn’t a dedicated mountain biking space been created? 3. **forestry vs. volunteer efforts**: why does the state permit the forestry industry to erase years of volunteer trail-building efforts for what appears to be short-term profit?",Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/16et1ip/portland_mountain_biking_has_been_decimated/,0

16er2f5,aita asking for a $1400 refund on my friends airbnb due to heavy wildfire some?," back in june my friend said to pick a weekend and we could stay at her dads family cabin. she made it sound like it would be free but ended up charging us the nightly rate he charges on air bnb, which i thought was understandable. so we paid $1400. 4 days before the trip, i was told there was heavy wildfire smoke and with my mil health, she might not be able to go if it continued. that day i texted my friend about what their cancellation policy was. she told me it was to late and i would receive no money back. luckily the smoke stopped and we continued with our trip. however, the day i asked my friend for their cancellation policy, i also viewed their house on airbnb to see the cancellation policy and it said they allowed 5 day cancellation at 100% and 50% until day of. i was honestly hurt and felt lied to about it and started to kind of distance myself to her. about a week later she asked what was going on and i let her know i was hurt and felt lied to and she admitted that she lied about the cancellation policy because she didn’t want to be out money. a day later she is furious that i would be mad that she lied to me and feels like she instead had every right to lie and be mad we would ask for a refund because in her words “ if your mil is concerned about natural fire smoke, she shouldn’t travel in the summer at all.” we have been going to this resort the last 3 labor days and never had a problem with smoke. she also said her dad was doing us a favor by allowing us to stay there but in my mind we did him one because he wasn’t charged the air bnb fee. aita and out of line to expect to be treated with the same courtesy they give strangers for cancellation? frankly i would have just booked through air bnb so we could have insurance for situations like this. i didn’t really imagine i would need it when it’s between friends.",AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16er2f5/aita_asking_for_a_1400_refund_on_my_friends/,0

very nice people and openly welcome new players! <3 some things that have occurred to keep in mind notes wise(these notes are courtesy of our faithful note taking centaur! frejlord: in the icy realm of frejlord, a chilling tale unfolds, filled with treachery, mystery, and the clash of titanic forces. it all began with a sinister plot involving the enigmatic alchemist, singed, who unleashed a plague of undead horrors upon the unsuspecting town, only to be revealed as an unintended consequence of a zombie infestation lurking in the shadows of the sewers. the blame was wrongly cast upon singed, forcing him to embark on a quest for a cure, which eventually granted him deliverance from the vile virus. meanwhile, amidst the turmoil, a great war erupted between the formidable leaders of frejlord: lissandra, ashe, and sejuani. in a fateful twist of fate, your intrepid band chose to ally with the noble and courageous ashe, fighting bravely on the front lines and ultimately emerging victorious, bringing an end to the bloody conflict. yet, there was a deeper and darker force at play. enter the boogeyman, known as babayaga or solomon, an arch-lich who had once challenged the very gods themselves during the epoch of the great war. this malevolent entity had ensnared lissandra, tainting her heart and twisting her into a maleficent puppet. as your group crossed paths with this ancient and immensely potent being, it was evident that he had awakened from his slumber, wielding unimaginable power even in his nascent state. amidst these trials and tribulations, your party's heartwarming journey took a tender turn. moved by compassion and benevolence, they chose to embrace orphans and carve a new beginning through the establishment of an orphanage. it was a testament to their pure spirits, and the druid among you emphasized the need for new companions to appreciate and cherish the company of the little ones. zaun/piltover: in the vibrant and bustling cities of zaun and piltover, their journey took a compelling turn, leading them to the heart of two metropolises intertwined by ingenuity and mystery. as the lingering marks of the past's poison stirred, they ventured to zaun in search of a cure. within the confines of this alchemical marvel, they found respite and healing, the poisons purged from their body by the expertise of zaunite healers. fortune favored them further when a gracious invitation brought them to a grand hospital in piltover, a marvel of architectural brilliance. however, this visit took an unexpected twist when an unfortunate soul was ruthlessly assassinated within the very walls of the esteemed establishment. the eerie echoes of a murder mystery beckoned you to uncover the truth. upon delving deeper, the intrepid group uncovered a shocking revelation—the targets of these murders were none other than corrupt heads of research within the hospital. their malevolence threatened the very foundation of this prestigious institution. but the plot thickened, and the web of intrigue extended beyond the confines of the hospital. it was revealed that the ""savior,"" a friend of the corrupt researchers, had become ensnared by the sinister machinations of solomon. this once benevolent soul had succumbed to corruption, even slaying his own family under the dark influence. in a somber yet necessary act, the group put an end to his suffering and freed him from the grip of darkness, sparing him from further torment. yet, the true enigma lay with the enigmatic figure of solomon. their investigations unveiled that his nefarious plans extended to ionia, where the world tree stood, its fate in jeopardy. a powerful force such as solomon could tip the delicate balance of ionia, and the very heart of nature itself was at risk. ionia: in a breathtaking twist of fate, the revelation of the world tree's impending demise struck like thunder, casting a shadow of despair over their journey. the urgency of the situation demanded swift action, and the adventurers set forth on a quest to seek a cure, hoping to save the very heart of ionia. amidst this perilous endeavor, tragedy struck close to home when the father of one of the players was brutally assassinated. the heartache of loss intensified the stakes, strengthening the resolve to unmask the culprits behind this heinous act. as your group pursued justice, the tendrils of the sinister cultists of solomon began to emerge. their dark influence stretched across lands and realities, threatening to plunge the world into chaos. with valor and cunning, the group thwarted the cultists' sinister machinations, putting an end to their malevolent plot. but the greatest revelation awaited—the cure for the dying world tree, the essence of life itself, was within your grasp. as the adventurers unlocked the secrets to saving the world tree, an unexpected miracle unfolded. the cure not only revitalized the ancient tree but the tree also brought back the father of the grieving companion. a reunion filled with tears of joy, an awe-inspiring testament to the power of hope and perseverance. yet, amidst this miraculous triumph, the specter of solomon loomed once more. the enigmatic adversary revealed himself anew, slipping away through a mysterious portal that led to bilgewater—a city steeped in its own legends and tales of daring pirates and dark secrets. bilgewater: the land the group currently resides! in this land of turmoil and opportunity, the four formidable contenders—miss fortune, gangplank, twisted fate, and graves—vie for dominance, each seeking to claim the ancient artifacts of old. legends speak of twelve sacred relics that, when united, possess the power to grant any wish, a force that can reshape reality itself. among the contenders, gangplank stands tall with a newfound advantage—a sinister alliance with the enigmatic solomon. the dark and powerful being provides gangplank with an edge, one that makes his bid for the artifacts all the more formidable. in this crucible of power, alliances are fleeting, and treachery is ever-present. the stakes are immeasurable, for the consequences of the victor's wish could reshape not only bilgewater but the entire realm of runeterra. \-while the group has had plenty of other shenanigans, these are the main plot points that have occurred so far, if you are invited to the group you are more than welcome to pick their brains for all that has occurred! while you may have your character be from any of the lands, keep in mind that the main arcs for frejlord, zaun/piltover, and ionia have already concluded and resolved so while the party may go back to these lands for various reasons, your backstory may be in the backburner for awhile if you are from these lands. about the group: \-there is no age requirement but i do recommend being 18 and up or at least having the maturity of being able to handle mature themes such as abuse, slavery, sexual acts, debauchery, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution \-currently we have 3 players! all players are level 10! a tiefling circle of wildfire druid, an artificer human tinkerer, and a centaur fey wanderer ranger. \-this is a big journey. i'll understand if you drop out if you aren't interested but if you are...be aware this adventure could take years to finish. it's once a week 4 hours for a couple years. think about it. it's an investment. \-time is a difficult issue for most people. i myself work full time and am only able to meet one day a week for a 5 hour session! please be aware and be able to meet this time before applying! the time in question is 10 am-2 pm pst time every tuesday. obviously i understand life gets in the way at times but please be able to meet this time consistently if you plan to join our adventure! \- the adventure will be filled with fighting, roleplay, exploration, free roaming, storytelling, a little railroading when necessary, but of course fun! i'd say 60-40, story/roleplaying and combat. general rules for my campaign: \- lgbtq+ friendly \- avrae bot, roll20, and discord will be the platform base but i'm okay with you using your own dice as long as you're honest with your rolls. i usually dm with my own dice but avrae is really nifty if you don't have your own dice \-we started at level 3 and are now level 10! \- standard array, point buy, or you can roll for your stats! \-must be willing to disconnect the player from the person, don't bring unnecessary drama into the group (don't take things personally) \-must be willing to allow others to shine. (play nice with one another) \-must be willing to work with the group and not be destructive for no reason. ( no murder hobo ) \-must be willing to accept consequences for actions in-game and death of characters. \-must be willing to attend games regularly and on time. \-there may be some flirting or mature themes but no pure nsfw content, the most things will get to is fade to black \-you may multiclass but please approve any homebrew content with me first such as classes, race, or items \-previous knowledge of league of legends is not mandatory but if this campaign interests you than i recommend either learning or having some base knowledge but no meta gaming. you can get excited when you see a champion you like but don't put your assumptions of what you know into the campaign...it doesn't end well \-roleplay is extremely important in my opinion. become your character, make decisions based on what they'd do from their experiences and past, build them, make a voice, play as them. i don't really do alignments but if it impacts how you play then go for it. just don't be a murderhobo who says ""it's what my character would do."" \-you don't need a webcam to play or join but you do need a mic and i recommend having a webcam as it helps me see when people are disinterested or want to move on with a plot. \-we do not use encumbrance (ew coin weight? i don't want to count that) but that doesn't mean you can pick up a rock every 3 seconds just to have on your person and sell later. i will find a puddle that is deep enough for you to drown in, don't tempt me. \-rewards. we like loot. loot is good. we like the feeling of accomplishment from killing a big bad evil guy and getting a bunch of gold, but standard dnd uses loot in a way of throwing away or selling old weapons and getting new ones. i do something completely different. in the beginning of the game within 5 or 6 sessions you will find yourself a weapon. a unique custom designed weapon i have made for you that will grow with you as your character becomes stronger. you will get other loot sure that you will use on your travels and use in unique situations but this weapon will be bound with you forever and be your best friend. \-speaking of gold. tony, how do we get rewarded for our adventures if we get custom made weapons that grow with us? i'm glad you asked. i think dnd can be too easy at times. gold, gold, gold everywhere and you just find magic items in chests sometimes. sure sometimes those chests are mimics but still. well. it is not quite that easy my friend. everything is sellable and everything is expensive. you'll find loot sure. maybe some gems, some dragon bones, you'll get the hide off a deer, some parchment of tales of a famous artifact, some fragments of a broken weapon. but earning money takes time and when you finally do have (if you read this far then congrats! message me secret word: higgledebum to earn bonus points/chance to get in!) enough to spend on that doohickey, staff, flame cloak, magic headband, returning dagger, poison pouch, or magic tattoo you've been eyeing for 7 sessions....it'll be all the more rewarding. i think oversaturation is a big problem in dnd. it should take time and be ever more rewarding when you get cool new stuff. it isn't just handed to you. you gotta earn that shit with blood, sweat, and tears. \-realism is a big part of dnd but it's only as real as you make it. your characters need to eat, sleep, and heal but i'm not going to keep track of every daily expense and force you to pay it every time \-i am a huge sucker for backstory. i love it. if you join please be prepared to write a unique backstory that i can include in the campaign. this isn't college there are no minimum or maximum requirements but give me more to work with and the more i can add to the campaign! maybe your mother was murdered and you need to track down her killer? (hey if you've read this far then kudos! here's the second secret word! potatoskins! don't worry it's the last one) maybe you got dissed that one time while playing on the streets for coin and you want to find him and prove you're an amazing bard? maybe some guy robbed you and you want to track him down and torture him? make it interesting make it unique! note\*: if this post is still up and not closed it means i have not made any decisions yet and am still taking/looking at applications! <3 please do be patient with me as i am taking my time and looking at all applications and thinking a lot before making any decisions! i will respond to all applications whether or not you get in however! to apply \-interested in joining? i don't blame you, if you're interested in joining this campaign then send me a private message on reddit with a handful of things: \- name and pronouns \- age and time zone(doesn't matter as long as you can make the above time) \- briefly describe your experience with ttrpgs. it’s ok if you don’t have any \- do you have any fears and or frustrations from ttrpgs (things that have caused bad experiences)? \-what class you want to play \-what land you wish to originate from \-what race you want to play \-what's your favorite meme? (send me a link!) \-what weapon do you want to be bonded with you for life? so far in my time as a dm i've had people request anime weapons, video game weapons, and custom mades. if it is within my power of balancing i will make it happen! \- what type of player are you, or what playstyle do you enjoy? ex: minmaxer, rolplayer, explorer, combat tactician. \- what do you like most about dnd? \- what do you dislike the most about dnd? \- what do you want from this campaign/group? \-roll 1d100 and 1d1000 for me and give me those numbers for some starting gear for you \- any questions for me or things you want me to know?",lfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/16ek13t/hello_hello_looking_for_12_players_for_an_ongoing/,0

16ebvxv,"invasive species cost global economy dearly, harm habitats, human health. thousands of invasive species cost the global economy more than $423 billion annually, according to an report by the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ipbes)."," LINK invasive species are causing harm to habitats, indigenous species, and ecosystems, which is impacting food systems and human health. the cost of this has quadrupled every year since 1970. humans have introduced over 37,000 species to new habitats, with over 3,500 considered invasive. > what are the invasive species? species not native to a particular place are primarily invasive. in many instances, new species threaten the original inhabitants by destroying ecology. this, in turn, can impact the food and agriculture of a place and finally humans. invasive species are responsible for 60% of plant and animal extinctions, according to a report by the ipbes. the report is based on a 2019 study that found one million species are at risk of extinction. the number of new alien species is increasing by about 200 every year, leading to greater impacts. ( LINK humans are speeding extinction and altering the natural world at an ‘unprecedented’ pace). an exhaustive report by 86 experts from 49 countries has analysed how invasive species are driving global biodiversity loss. the report includes inputs from indigenous people and local communities and highlights the impact of invasive species related to wildlife trade, such as the zebra mussels, which have caused local mussels to become endangered. the report suggests that the zebra mussels arrived in north america with european cargo ships in the 1980s. ( LINK ) > there are examples of species that were **introduced in new places for their perceived benefits and started growing uncontrollably**. these factors should be pondered upon, the researchers said. > invasive species can also cause human health problems. for example, mosquitoes responsible for transmitting diseases like malaria, dengue or the zika virus **are becoming invasive around the world**. anibal pauchard, a leader of the ipbes assessment, stated that poor communities are often the most affected by climate change. he also mentioned that **mosquitoes may spread to new areas, such as new york, due to climate change**. > **ecosystems disturbed by invasive species may also lose their resilience to diseases and other threats as a consequence of loss of biodiversity due to invasive species. a recent example is the wildfires in hawaii wildfires, invaded by invasive grasses that helped spread the fire**. > with climate change and global warming, invasive species can help cause such massive events. to sustain biodiversity, invasive species should be reduced as much as possible. **notably, 190 countries, minus the usa, signed an agreement to protect biodiversity last december**. ( LINK nearly every country signs on to a sweeping deal to protect nature).

16ebdsw,delta has officially pulled its nonstop flights to maui from minneapolis and atlanta after wildfires have devastated the island,"i'm not sure if i'm allowed to post the link (since it goes to a travel blog) but delta has officially pulled their daily nonstop flights from msp and atl from their winter schedule. losing this traffic from two of delta's biggest hubs is going to put a dent in visitor traffic during the busiest times of the year. as i've said before, locals and small business owners really need to be louder in countering the never-tourism crowd that is prolific on tiktok. sure, they might be a minority but they are a very loud minority and you need to be just as loud in countering their mis-guided voices.",MauiVisitors,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/16ebdsw/delta_has_officially_pulled_its_nonstop_flights/,0

16e9uf2,why is the army so corrupt?,"i’m sitting here with absolutely nothing to do thinking about the future and started wondering how did we get here? generals run smuggling operations, involved in kidnapping, murder and rapes. they can lay claim to any land and no one can do anything about it. they become the supreme ruler of pakistan, working in their own benefit and pushing people down the poverty line where they are killing themselves. i know once corruption infiltrates an organization it can spread like wildfire, and this is just the status quo now where only the corrupt are promoted and sincere and honest people are crushed at the lower ranks. however all this started somewhere. at some point there was an opportunity where they could’ve been corrected, reformed and kept in line with their duties. someone could’ve called them out and punished the responsible people, but that never happened. my question is why? maybe someone did try but didn’t succeed. maybe the people who had the power to correct them were corrupt themselves and the nation was too naive to know that. maybe it was something else. let me know your thoughts on where we went wrong.",chutyapa,https://www.reddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/16e9uf2/why_is_the_army_so_corrupt/,0
16e9pxp,[final update] oop is hurt that he wasn't invited to a wedding all his friends were invited to. turns out there's a very specific reason,"**i am not oop. please do not harass oop.** originally posted in r/amitheasshole by u/same_file_502 3 updates - medium **links:** [original post]( LINK - july 27, 2023 [update 1]( LINK \- july 29, 2023 (2 days later) [update 2]( LINK \- august 5, 2023 (7 days later) [update 3]( LINK \- august 14, 2023 (9 days later) ... mood spoilers: >!this one has a nice, happy ending to all the drama!< … # [original post]( LINK - july 27, 2023 **aita for saying that i was hurt that i wasnt invited to a wedding that all my old friends were invited to?** i (28m) used to have a friend group of about 10 people back when we were in middle and highschool then college happened and we all drifted apart. nothing happened to make us drift apart, just growing up and losing contact. still friends but not ""talk all the time. hang out regularly"" friends if that makes sense. but of course some of us stayed close friends with eachother. one person from this friend group ""kayla"" (fake name) (28f) is getting married in a few weeks. i didnt get an invitation but i wasnt hurt. i understood. we didnt stay close friends. but then i was hanging out with my best friend ""bob"", (28m) who was also in that friend group, a few days ago and he mentioned that he's going to the wedding. i was a little surprised but i just told him i hoped he had a good time. he asked if i was going and i told him no, i didnt get an invite. he said that was strange because everyone else from the group was going. two of them were plus ones as they were dating or married to other ones who got an invite. but they were all going and kayla knew it and even told bob she was really happy that ""the gang was getting back together on her special day"". i told bob i was kinda hurt by that but i didnt want to make a big deal of it. two days pass. kayla calls me fuming mad that i was ""whining that i didnt get an invite to anyone who would listen"". i told her that i wasnt. i explained to her what happened. she said that shes been getting texts and calls from other members of the group saying that she should have included me and wanted me to put a stop to it. i said i would do my best and that i was sorry that i caused her this trouble. she thanked me for the apology and hung up. i called bob and asked him why he spread this around and he said that he didnt mean to. he felt bad that i was hurt and he wanted to ask someone else from the group if they knew why i wasnt invited and she spread it around i guess and everyone wanted to know why kayla cut me out specifically so they started asking her. so i made a facebook group chat with all of them and politely asked them to leave kayla alone. that i was just hurt in the moment and vented about it to my best friend and thats where it should have stayed. they all said okay and apologized to kayla. yesterday kayla made a facebook post ranting about me without saying my name and said she had to hire security and give them a photo of me to make sure i didnt try to crash the wedding. something i would never do. the comments under the post were calling her out. she called me again and screamed at me that i was ruining her wedding and told me that some of the friends are considering not going to the wedding now. and now im just wondering if i should have just kept my mouth shut or stood up for myself or what **edit:** next day i woke up to 160 something notifications on this and im doing my best to answer questions and all that. but to answer some frequent questions and points: im bi, i have no knowledge of kayla ever having a crush on me, i dont know if her fiance is gay or bi, i never dated kayla, i dated someone else from the group back in highschool into college but the relationship ended amicably and im still good friends with her, the only notable event that might have made things weird is that we all went skinny dipping once when we were 16 but nothing else really happened there and as far as i know, nobody was creeped out or anything by it. there was no big political shift in any of us that may have divided us. &#x200b; **verdict:** *nta* ... # [update 1]( LINK - july 29, 2023 (2 days later) i finally got an answer to why i wasn't invited to the wedding. turns out that someone else from the group named ""samantha"" (again, fake names all around) has had a crush on me for years but has been too afraid to tell me or act on it. samantha was in the bridal party of kayla's wedding and told kayla that she was finally going to make a move on me at the wedding after all her bridal party duties were taken care of. kayla didn't like this and thinks that i'm not good enough for samantha but she didn't say anything and decided to just not invite me and hope samantha dropped it. but when samantha heard about me not being invited, she could smell the bullshit and confronted kayla, knowing exactly why i wasn't invited and said she wasn't sure she wanted to be in the bridal party after kayla would do something like this to her. that's when kayla called me and flipped out the first time. after the group chat where i asked them to stop, samantha was so upset that she did drop out of the bridal party and that prompted the second phone call blow up to me. samantha called me this afternoon and told me all this, apologized for all the bullshit and asked me out for dinner on the night of the wedding and i accepted. this might seem petty to go out on the night of the wedding but it was samantha's idea and also kayla is batshit crazy and her number and social media is blocked so i cant get any more calls if she blows up a third time. thanks for the judgement and kind words and reassurances in the aita post. ... # [update 2]( LINK - august 5, 2023 (7 days later) i posted this to the bottom of my update post but someone told me to make it its own post so here you go. hi sorry i havent checked this in a few days. little baby updates for you. nothing big enough for a full update yet. the wedding and my date with sam is next weekend so expect the big update after that. sam is considering/joking (not sure which) that shes going to wear her bridesmaid dress to the date because she loves the color, she already paid for it and ""my tits look fantastic in it"". im a little worried thats too ""shoving it in kayla's face"" but sam says she deserves it. i also asked sam if she would be willing to write her own pov here and she said she would love to and that she will after our date when we go back to my place. also kayla actually sent me a letter in the mail apologizing and asking to unblock her so we can talk about this and ""heal the loose ends"". i didnt unblock her. sam is completely certain that shes only trying to apologize so that ill tell the other 4 friends who have dropped out of the wedding to attend it. like i said. big updates next weekend and sam's pov ... # [update 3]( LINK - august 14, 2023 (9 days later) sorry for the delay. wedding and my date was saturday. it went very well and sam spent the night and all day sunday with me and i considered writing this update on sunday but i just wanted to have fun for a day, you know? anyway, update. out of the 10 people that were in that friend group, 4 went to the wedding. kayla (of course), one that is kayla's cousin but still sides with me, her partner, and another who's mom is best friend with kayla's mom and ""would absolutely kill me if i didnt go, despite all this bullshit"". sam has kayla blocked on everything but kayla has sent her 3 written letters trying to convince her to reconsider dropping out of the wedding and shown up at kayla's house twice to try in person. sam burned all 3 letters and didnt answer the door both times but told kayla through the door the second time that if she didnt go away, sam would call the cops. kayla called her an ungrateful skank and ran away. while the wedding was going on, the 3 friends at the wedding were leaking info sam and i in a group chat. kayla replaced sam in the wedding party with another cousin in a dress that didnt match the others. kayla seemed happy throughout the wedding and honestly, despite all this, im happy that she was happy at her wedding, or at least pretended to be happy, as sam said she might be doing. no big drama or blow up or anything happened at the wedding and kayla and her husband are off to a honeymoon in hawaii. which i dont know how well thats going to go with the wildfires going on there right now. now to the date, it went very very well. we met up at a korean bbq place that i said was good and we just had a great time talking about the past, how long shes had a crush on me (since middle school), talking about the kayla situation, and just all sorts of stuff. afterwards we went back to my place and spent the night together and all day the next day, she read these reddit posts and a bunch of comments. i said she could make her own account to post her pov or i could just let her use this one and she said she would text me her pov and i could just copy and paste it here so thats what im going to do under all this. sam and i have a few more dates lined up and the others from the group know about kayla's reason for excluding me from the wedding and are cheering us on. really happy that this came out of a bad situation. thanks to everyone who assured me i wasnt in the wrong, cheered me on through this, and made me laugh with funny comments after i was feeling pretty down and felt like an asshole that ruined his friends wedding when i clearly didnt do anything wrong and this just kinda happened to me and i handled it as best i could **sam's pov:** hi reddit. i'm ""sam"". he never gave himself a fake name so i'll call him ""skipper"". i've had a crush on skipper since about 6th grade but never acted on it for various reason such as my fear of rejection, he was dating my friend for a while, i thought he was gay, things like that. but when kayla was getting married i saw an opportunity to finally go for it. then i got my bridesmaid dress and saw how incredible i looked in it and that solidified my drive to make a move on skipper. i was so excited that i told kayla about all this and she smiled and said she was happy for me. i took that to mean she was cool with it. then some time passes and i get word from one of our friends that skipper was not invited and i was suspicious right away. kayla was one of my best friends growing up and i love her but she's always had this underhanded side to her and i suspected that my plan was the reason skipper wasn't invited so i asked her about it. she tried to dodge the question and manipulate me but finally she just admitted it and told me that skipper wasn't good enough for me. i was furious and told her i was extremely hurt that she would do something like this to me and that i wasn't sure i wanted to be her bridesmaid anymore. she screamed at me and hung up. later i was added to a group chat with the other members of the group and skipper asked us all to drop whatever we were saying to kayla and i just knew that kayla had bitched him out about this but i wanted to respect what skipper was asking us to do and keep the peace so i kept my mouth shut. but then kayla made that facebook post and i was so upset that i called her and dropped out of the wedding. i understand that's when she called skipper and screamed at him the second time. a day or two passes and i call skipper and tell him what happened and ask him out. he says yes, kayla harasses me for a while in text, calls, letters, and showing up at my house until i block her on everything and threaten to call the cops on her. the date went amazingly well and skipper is an amazing man that i'm so glad i finally asked him out. i read some of your comments and i don't know if kayla was trying to set me up with someone else. she never said so or alluded to it. i don't think kayla has a crush on me or skipper, we were close friends for decades now and she never said anything to indicate that. and finally some of you asked me to post a photo of myself in the dress. i'm not comfortable doing that. i look amazing in it but i'm just not comfortable posting photos of myself all over the internet especially connected to a story like this where it would be easy to connect the dots and probably find out my real name and things like that. but thanks to everyone that told skipper he wasn't an asshole and cheered him on once they found out that i exist and that i was the drama nexus. and as many of you said, i promise that if this relationship goes well and we end up getting married, kayla will be as far from it as humanly possible. … &#x200b; marked as **concluded:** the original conflict is over and oop indicated that this would probably be the final update &#x200b; **i

so far so good. we live in a fire-ish zone so smoke has been a consistent presence in the valley for weeks now. this is what happened last year, too: i tried to get back into running right at the moment smoke filled all the outdoor air. now i'm stuck indoors. last year i swung my kettlebell, which was fine, but now the ceilings are so low i'm afraid i'm going to hit my baby's head on the ceiling lamp when i pick them up and the kettlebell will certainly leave a hole in my ceiling. 2 years ago i was training for a marathon, lived in a rural place where it was easy to run. unfortunately due to life circumstances, fell out of routine in the middle of moving. i've gained over 40 pounds due to a combination of what i've been eating and because of alcohol consumption, which increased and now is decreasing... but i can feel the impacts all over my body. i had to buy all new pants, and i bought them slightly smaller to motivate me to continue to work out, but it's hit or miss. sometimes i will feel self-confident when they appear to fit better and then more self-conscious and uncomfortable in tight fitting clothes. many years ago i trained regularly in martial arts, which i fell out of when i got to university and then moved repeatedly with seasonal, outdoor teaching jobs (which was great because i was fit by virtue of my job). i'm looking at joining a judo gym in town, but on top of the registration costs/first month expense, i'm gonna have to buy a whole new set of judo-gis unique to the school (even though i have my old, plain ones from years ago in my duffle bag in the garage... ugh). total cost probably gonna be close to $500 to start up and then probably close to $200 per month after the fact. i'm not really interested in paying for a plain-gym membership when i'm able to run or ride my bike for free. but i'm not wanting to run or ride my bike when it's dangerously smokey outside. **tl;dr**: i am carrying the most amount of fat on my body right now since before i joined martial arts in my teens. i'm really struggling to find the willpower to change my diet and i don't know how ambitious i should be at the gym. life is hard, i want to get fit, and our living quarters are challenging, even for yoga, for how low the ceilings are. there is smoke outside because of wildfires and i don't want to run in smoke. i want to train at a martial arts gym but i'm intimidated by start up costs. too many of my waking hours are devoted to cleaning my house or caring for my baby, but scheduling my workouts may be my best option, a la training at the judo gym. i work early mornings starting at 4 am until around 1 pm. **here are my stats**: 30 m : 5 feet and 11.5' inches tall : 220 lbs : goal weight is 180 lbs. no significant health issues or injuries. sometimes i have pain in my knee from tightness in other muscles after running several times in one week. my job is fairly sedentary / working from home. before the wildfire smoke came back, i was averaging 10 minute miles and my average run was about 3 miles. i have cardio bicycle for 'round the town, running gear, martial arts sparring equipment and my partner said she would be willing to learn how to shadow spar with me. the judo gym i want to train at is within 25 minute walking distance (and probably much shorter time if i ran there) or a 7 minute bike ride or 3 minutes via car. they have classes m-f starting at 7 pm. my aspirational side wants me to train like 4-5 days per week. part of this is because i want my kid to get into the community and learn the martial art when they're old enough and i want to start now so it's part of the family culture and for my own health and personal fulfillment. **what i'm wanting from reddit...** well wishes, dietary advice, fitness planning, podcasts, motivation and coaching related to martial arts or fitness in general... i'm somewhat disheartened by the late start i'm getting into training martial arts and hope i can stay motivated when the field is full of gung-ho teens and twenties folk. **edit 1 - current diet:** probably the unhealthiest thing i consume is alcohol several times per week, with periods of drinking and not drinking. i would say my tolerance to alcohol is pretty high by now. i tend to eat more when i plan on running. when i wasn't running i had a different diet - very carb-light. after i started running i added carbohydrates and i guess i haven't appropriately changed my diet since like 2 years ago. been eating a lot of sugars and fats because i like to eat food when i'm stressed. otherwise i've been having green smoothies nearly daily, we are keeping most our food gluten free, i drink coffee with milk and half and half, i tend to skip at least one meal. i'd be interested in fasting again.",fitness30plus,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/16e94vl/m30_southern_oregon_fitness_babies_fire_woes_low/,0

16e89m8,emilisis vs the indian dwarves,"in the tumultuous realm of eldoria, a rebel group known as emilisis had risen to challenge the oppressive rule of king callum of toeman. their insurgency had gained momentum, posing a significant threat to the kingdom's stability. however, the rebels were about to encounter an unexpected and cunning duo that would leave them baffled and ultimately defeated. &#x200b; meet jake and arjun, two indian dwarves renowned for their wit and ingenuity. while they may have been small in stature, their minds were as sharp as any sword in the land. aware of the rebel group's activities, jake and arjun devised a plan that would exploit the rebels' weaknesses and sow discord among their ranks. &#x200b; step one: infiltration. jake and arjun, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, entered the territory controlled by emilisis. they set up a humble stall in the bustling marketplace, offering exotic trinkets and curiosities from distant lands. the rebels, ever curious and seeking supplies, soon became their regular customers. &#x200b; step two: subtle manipulation. jake and arjun played the role of harmless traders to perfection. they engaged the rebels in casual conversations, subtly steering discussions towards the topics of loyalty and leadership within emilisis. over time, they learned of the factional divisions and power struggles within the rebel group. &#x200b; step three: forged documents. armed with the knowledge of the rebel group's internal strife, jake and arjun concocted a series of forged letters and messages. these deceitful missives purported to be orders from high-ranking rebel leaders, but they contained conflicting directives, causing confusion and mistrust among the rebels. &#x200b; step four: whispered lies. the dwarves began a whispering campaign, discreetly spreading rumors among the rebels. they claimed to have overheard conversations about betrayal and secret alliances, alluding to the existence of traitors within emilisis. paranoia began to gnaw at the unity that had once bound the rebels together. &#x200b; step five: the unraveling. as the mistrust among the rebels deepened, conflicts erupted, and accusations were hurled. suspicion tore through emilisis like wildfire, and the rebels turned on one another, all while jake and arjun watched from the shadows. &#x200b; the cunning dwarves had successfully exploited the fractures within emilisis, leading to their downfall. the rebellion that had once threatened king callum's rule was now consumed by infighting and chaos. in the end, emilisis crumbled not from external forces, but from the cunning manipulation of two unlikely masterminds. &#x200b; jake and arjun slipped away from eldoria, their mission accomplished, leaving the rebels to ponder the lessons of their undoing. the tale of the two cunning indian dwarves would be whispered in the kingdom for generations to come as a cautionary tale of how deceit and division can spell the demise of even the mightiest of movements.",vaughancult,https://www.reddit.com/r/vaughancult/comments/16e89m8/emilisis_vs_the_indian_dwarves/,0

(shinichiro wada) is the editor of [*modern metal guidebook*]( LINK where he wrote 500 album reviews or so. in his review of *unseen world*, he specifically acclaimed *giovanni*. previous discussion: * [\[*rolling stone japan*\] band-maid’s *10th anniversary best* album cross review: individuality born with blend of border-crossing hard rock / heavy metal \(in japanese\)]( LINK &#x200b; ----- **a joint review of band-maid’s** ***10th anniversary best*** **: uniqueness that emerged from hard rock/metal and a cross-genre combination** band-maid have released the best-of albums [*10th anniversary best*]( LINK to celebrate their 10th anniversary. the albums, which literally cover their 10-year trajectory, contain 30 songs in 2 volumes, selected and remastered from their indie-label period, their nippon crown period after the major-label debut, and after their label change to pony canyon. as the globally active band-maid will restart their north american tour in august including lollapalooza chicago, one of the three biggest outdoor festivals in the us, on august 4, and mexico, the two music journalists tomokazu nishibiro and s.h.i. deep-dive into the best-of albums. **1. the 10 years of band-maid traced through their musical shift** tomokazu nishibiro band-maid, formed in 2013 and celebrating their 10th anniversary this year, will be releasing their first best-of albums *band-maid 10th anniversary best vol. 1* and *vol. 2* simultaneously. the 30 songs in total that summarize their career to date beyond the boundary of the labels are not a mere collection of singles but a clear projection of the “live band band-maid”, and it will be ideal for beginners interested in trying band-maid. in this review, we will clarify the appeal of band-maid by looking back on their history and referring to the songs on the best-of and the original albums those songs were first released on. i remember it was around 2015-2016 when band-maid, who debuted with their first album *maid in japan*, found their direction to go in. the songs on it were all written by external songwriters, although the band was involved in the arrangement. musically, while it had a hard rock taste common with their current style, they tried to reach a wider range of listeners rather than limiting themselves to a single genre. then, in august of the same year, they released their first single *love, passion, matador*, and one of the songs on the single would greatly influence their destiny. the song is [*thrill*]( LINK which would be included later also in their second album *new beginning* (2015). the band members did arrange it but didn’t write its lyrics or music. however, it had the heavy guitar riffs by kanami (guitar) and miku kobato (guitar/vocals) emphasizing low tones, the rhythm ensemble by akane (drums) and misa (bass) that drives performance with a deep rumbling groove, and the singing voice of saiki (vocals) with freshness and a hint of glamour… and their distinct sound created by that combination was highly acclaimed overseas before in japan, which must have given them more confidence in what music to create from that point on. i interviewed them for the first time in [spring 2016]( LINK immediately after they released their third album *brand new maid* (2016). even at the time of the interview, they already achieved their first overseas “serving” (concert) at sakura-con, an event in the us, in march 2016, as they attracted attention from overseas after the *thrill* mv was featured on the american online radio/media *jrock radio*. they mesmerized a whopping 3,000 “masters and princesses” (fans) with their contrasting visuals and sounds there. after that, they went on a world tour in mexico, the uk, germany, france, and so on. moreover, as *brand new maid* and their later works were distributed by the major label, they gradually gained recognition in japan, which gave them increasingly more opportunities to appear at rock events such as [naon no yaon]( LINK and [arabaki rock fest]( LINK as i wrote above, in their first three albums (*thrill*, [*real existence*]( LINK [*shake that!!*]( LINK [*the non-fiction days*]( LINK and [*freedom*]( LINK on this best-of), band-maid arranged songs provided by external songwriters in a satisfactory way for the five of them and showed dynamic sound and ensemble under the influence of authentic hard rock and j-rock in the ’90s and onwards. it was not until the band’s first original song, [*alone*]( LINK that their “identity” began to be more firmly established. they tried several times to write an original song before that, but they couldn’t get an ok from their staff for quite some time. they finally wrote the convincing song and included it in their third album *brand new maid*. it showed that band-maid began to make their future great strengths their own, namely the performance and arrangement that constantly show the instrumentalists’ high skill level, the emotional melody that shines on the hard and anxious sounds, and saiki and kobato’s twin vocals. it was probably their other “new beginning” next to *thrill*. then, band-maid wrote 9 of the 13 songs on their fourth album [*just bring it*]( LINK (2017) only by themselves. kobato wrote lyrics to two other songs. by writing almost all the songs on it by themselves, they successfully sublimated “band-maid-ness” into an even purer form. in fact, the album has many songs that deeply reflect the band’s experiences at servings and on tours in japan and overseas and stand out live more than before. the songs on the best-of that correspond to that phase are [*yolo*]( LINK [*don’t you tell me*]( LINK [*puzzle*]( LINK and [*secret my lips*]( LINK in their fifth album [*world domination*]( LINK (2018), they grew to the point that they were involved in writing the music and the lyrics of all the 14 songs, excluding the bonus track *honey* (mucc cover) on the standard edition. as the title “world domination” indicates, band-maid projected their strong attitude on the high-quality songs, which make you feel not only the growth of their playing and arranging skills but also the growth of saiki and kobato as vocalists at various moments. you can’t miss saiki’s singing voice that became more powerful and convincing with each album, of course, but you also can’t miss kobato’s vocals with an “intensity hidden under cuteness” in [*rock in me*]( LINK where she sings the lead vocals. incidentally, [*time*]( LINK where kobato sings the lead, included in the previous album *just bring it*, can’t be missed either, so listen to it if you have the chance. band-maid, moving forward to “world domination”, didn’t let up in their sixth album [*conqueror*]( LINK (2019) either. band-maid composed and arranged all the songs on the album including the *oricon* top 20 singles [*glory*]( LINK and [*bubble*]( LINK and kobato wrote all the lyrics except for the english song [*the dragon cries*]( LINK (produced by [tony visconti]( LINK who worked many times with one of saiki’s favorite musicians, david bowie, although not included in this best-of), so you can fully enjoy the band-maid sound of almost 100% purity. in songs such as the abovementioned *bubble*, as well as [*endless story*]( LINK [*blooming*]( LINK and [*rinne*]( LINK the band delivers a timeless, “extra-thick and wild” hard rock sound, and you can fully enjoy the overwhelming feel that would leave you breathless. the band kept doing servings with *conqueror* in their hands, and in 2020, they announced that they would do their first solo serving at nippon budokan on february 11, 2021. however, around the same time, an unknown virus spread like wildfire across the globe, which drastically changed the entertainment world. a series of show cancellations and various restrictions prevented them from doing their activities as they wanted for long. despite those circumstances, the five of band-maid, imagining an “unseen world”, released their seventh album [*unseen world*]( LINK (2021), and were going to face the challenge of budokan with the substantial album in hand. you know what happened, however. unfortunately, their solo serving at budokan has not come true yet as of the end of july 2023. although *unseen world*, with the themes “return to the roots” and “progress from the present”, was a collection of songs created under the unusual circumstances of the covid pandemic, the band’s aggressive stance didn’t waver at all. [*warning!*]( LINK [*no god*]( LINK [*after life*]( LINK and [*manners*]( LINK which are also included in this best-of, will get their unshakable belief across to you. then, as the situation was gradually eased, they released the ep [*unleash*]( LINK (2022), which opened the second chapter of band-maid’s world domination. as the title of “unleash” indicates, it was packed with hard and heavy tunes over the critical point, as if to break the stagnated world. of those songs, the best-of has selected [*corallium*]( LINK which straightforwardly shows the band’s growth, but i hope you will check out their latest work *unleash* too if you become more interested in the 10 years of band-maid through the two best-of albums. this august, band-maid are going on a north american tour including their first appearance at the popular outdoor festival lollapalooza chicago in the us. in september after returning to japan, they will restart the domestic leg of the *band-maid 10th anniversary tour* that started in march. the tour final, with the largest-ever capacity for a solo serving, will be held at yokohama arena on november 26. it will be undoubtedly the biggest turning point in their 10-year history of aiming for world domination. i really hope those of you new masters and princesses will go to see them at a serving if you become interested in band-maid even just a little through the two best-of albums. that said, even if i didn’t recommend you to do it, listening to the best-of will naturally make you want to see them live and hear their sound live. **2. a cross-genre combination that has satisfied even conservative hard rock/metal fans** s.h.i. first of all, i would like you to know that band-maid is an extremely good band with a great significance in metal and in the history of japanese rock. they tend to be treated as a gimmick band because of their starting point of trying to combine [maid outfits]( LINK and a band, but their actual sound is far heavier than you might imagine from such a concept, and their maid outfits that give you a comical impression rather function as soft combat uniforms to neutralize their tough sound. on top of that, they have so many musical ideas. band-maid’s musicality is, to put it simply, {strong-style power metal + the diverse musical vocabulary of japanese rock from the 1990s onwards} × the metal sound from the 2010s onwards, in which their outstanding craft smoothly combines elements that can hardly meet in the conventional silo-mentality view of genres. among the most important are probably the so-called female rock element and the j-rock-like emo element. that context has been neglected by hard rock/metal fans in japan, and there have been few cases where a metal band is welcomed for using such non-metal elements, while quite a few non-metal bands (usually in so-called visual-kei) have successfully incorporated and made full use of metal elements. however, band-maid have succeeded in such a difficult combination with a metal-oriented balance and satisfied even conservative hard rock/metal fans. i think that’s a very rare feat. what is important on top of that is their uniqueness that can only be created through such a cross-genre combination. just like many european folk metal bands incorporate traditional musical elements from their countries of origin and many japanese bands introduce japanese scales, band-maid incorporate and make use of j-rock-like emo and female rock ingredients as their essense well. that is a difficult combination for non-japanese bands to imitate, which leads band-maid to their excellent originality. it allows them to establish both a critical reevaluation of the context that has been neglected in the metal scene and a musical depth that can be obtained only through tackling the context. that approach is similar to babymetal (in the case of babymetal, a reevaluation of bands such as seikima-ii and [x japan]( LINK whose greatness wasn’t fully recognized yet in the mid-2010s, and an introduction of the comtemporary, advanced metal vocabulary such as deathcore and trap metal), and band-maid, an all-female band, achieve it by themselves. i hope the recognition and evaluation of them from that perspective will be more widely shared. *band-maid 10th anniversary best vol. 1* and *vol. 2* are best-of albums that very clearly summarize the musicality explained above. both of the volumes have diverse tunes, but i would say *vol. 1* has more j-rock-like emo ingredient, and *vol. 2* has more female rock ingredient. for example, *daydreaming* on *vol. 1* has a ballad-like vibe common with luna sea and l’arc~en~ciel, with slight darkness like chihiro onizuka and thick, tough edginess unique to metal. what is skillful about the song is that they untangled musical ingredients of the emo lineage that metal fans don’t like (such as cliché chord progressions) and arranged them in a form more acceptable for those fans. they used the finesse of arrangement also in the other songs in various ways. *puzzle* on *vol. 2* shows their great technique to put the female rock element of [nanase aikawa]( LINK and the like (a vibe similar to [being]( LINK and avex in the ’90s) into the sound of nu metal, metalcore and onwards. its intro riff belongs to the lineage of the melodic hard rock of the ’80s such as europe and journey, but by making it far louder in accordance with the criteria of metalcore and edm, they were able to sublimate it into a form that appeals to those different listeners. they manage to create such a cross-genre mixture without making you feel anything strange just by hearing it, and successfully make musical picky eaters swallow it. this release of the two best-of albums is also meaningful in that it clearly shows their culinary skill of music. that musicality of band-maid was already demonstrated in their classic song *thrill* (music and lyrics by [kentaro akutsu]( LINK who played an important role as a [songwriter in their early days]( LINK which made them choose hard rock/metal when they were looking for the band’s musical direction. the basic tone of the song is strong power metal similar to loudness and accept in the ’80s, but with the thick sound production of nu metal and onwards, while the vocal melody belongs to the lineage of female metal/rock such as [show-ya]( LINK it smoothly fused the elements that couldn’t be easily combined from the conventional hard rock/metal viewpoint, and it became band-maid’s important musical origin (and it’s the first track of *vol. 1* probably because of that perception). their musical width like that was well shown already in their first mini-album *maid in japan* (2014) released before they chose to go in the hard rock/metal direction. it was not until *just bring it* (2017) that the band members began to write most songs themselves, but the wide variety of musical styles in their early-day songs probably contributed to the richness of their original songs. band-maid’s starting point, including their maid outfits, tends to be seen as a gimmick band from the metal viewpoint, but exactly because of that, they are free from excessive expectations of authentic metal mannerism, and that has allowed them to widen their musicality freely (which is also applied to seikima-ii). this best-of is also an indication of the trajectory of such activities. actually, some of their recent songs are not easy to analyze as the abovementioned “combination of elements”. for example, *glory* on *vol. 1* (first released on *conqueror* in 2019), in my view, fuses authentic power metal like vicious rumors and alternative metal from the 2000s onwards like maximum the hormone through a speedy feel of mathcore and melodic hardcore, and reaches to the emo lyricism in the final part… but each element is fused together and hard to separate, which is sublimated into the excellent uniqueness of band-maid. similarly, *no god* on *vol. 2* (first released on *unseen world* in 2021) completely fuses a verse with an tricky heavy metal/power metal riff accelerated to the tempo of melodic power metal (in which genre riffs are usually simple to accompany with vocals) and a chorus and a bridge with foreground emo/post-rock ingredients, through solo-like instrumental parts moving beyond those contexts. lastly, *corallium*, the final track of *vol. 2* (first released on *unleash* in 2022), blends a j-r&b element like [namie amuro]( LINK and an alternative metal vibe together to create an almost unrivaled flavor (and noticing their j-r&b element makes it easier to see that *rinne*, for example, is composed of slayer-style thrash metal + j-r&b). this best-of is very enjoyable and meaningful also in that you can see how they gradually established their identity. so that’s my overview of band-maid’s position in music and the fulfilling contents of *band-maid 10th anniversary best*. the album, with all songs remastered and in a good song order, is excellent as an introduction to the band for those who haven’t listened to them and also as a clue to understand them better for those who have already listened to them. moreover, they have many good songs not included this time, so i hope you will also try their original albums. they have only masterpieces that allow you to enjoy the exquisiteness of critical creativity unique to band-maid.",BandMaid,https://www.reddit.com/r/BandMaid/comments/16e7rb3/translation_a_joint_review_of_bandmaids_10th/,0

16e71im,herbal allies for potential chest infection?,"hi everyone, my husband has been struggling with some respiratory difficulties for a while. we live in southern wisconsin where the smoke from the canada wildfires really did a number on the air quality. he wakes up coughing almost every morning. mostly productive, some tightness in his chest. slightly yellow mucus that clears up in color and frequency after he’s been awake awhile. i’ve been giving him a tea in the morning with mullein, thyme, elderberry+flower, red clover, white pine. he says it helps pretty immediately. we are not against going to the doctor, but money is really tight for another week or two. any ideas on other things i can try in the meantime until we can afford to see the doctor? i’ve done some digging in the sub and was considering oregano oil supplements/steam? idk y’all, i’m lost. any advice is greatly appreciated black_heart ",herbalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/16e71im/herbal_allies_for_potential_chest_infection/,0

16e34pv,“tax credits unchained”. quentin tarantino scores $20mm in government subsidies for latest film . . .,"&#x200b; LINK ***photo above*** *- ai generated art based on the prompt ""members of the screen actor's guild and writer's guild react to quentin tarantino's government subsidy.""* [**quentin tarantino’s ‘the movie critic’ nabs $20m in tax credits – the hollywood reporter**]( LINK before anyone starts hatin' on me - i'm actually a huge quentin tarantino fan. i have a shot from “pulp fiction” on my facebook page. one of my past online aliases was honey-bunny. natural born killers is a fave, not only for tarantino, but also because it has woody harrelson in it. so if you're a hollywood director this rich and powerful, why do you need millions and millions in government subsidies before you even start shooting your next film? (see link above) okay – let's inoculate this post against financial morons. ***$20 million is a lot of money.*** don't try claiming that it's not. $20 million is more than a normal person is going to earn in 10 lifetimes. it's why we buy powerball tickets and dream of quitting our jobs if we even hit the low $5 million jackpot. **freakin' $20 million film subsidy!!** passed out by the government of california to hollywood big shots. for what will probably turn out to be an action movie, containing “violence, drugs, tobacco use, and brief nudity”, if tarantino's past films are anything to go on. all this while there are la homeless tent cities two miles long. while stores are fleeing the state because police can't solve the mystery of when smash and grab looters will strike next. where crappy homes cost $500,000, middle class ones $1.5 million, and the places where hollywood directors, producers actors live probably cost . . . like $20 million? coincidentally, that's the same amount that tarantino just scored from his buds in the government. i bet you have to show up at more than one cocktail party and rub elbows with 2nd and 3rd tier politicians to get a jackpot like that. but he did it. $20 million !! i am probably naive. i simply don't understand the way the world works. why would any government agency pass out millions and millions to make films, when there is so much crime and violence. why wouldn't that money instead be spent on replacing century old california edison high voltage lines, which spark wildfires any time the breeze blows? or fixing the 500 decrepit dams that get breached whenever it does rain? why is there even a state agency to shepherd these grants? staffed with friends and relatives of california's most entrenched politicians? i'm guessing these aren't volunteers. they're civil servants, who get paid up front, even before deciding if the next $20 million goes to quentin tarantino, or warner brothers, or universal, or disney studios. does this work like hollywood agent casting calls? if you're a semi-important bureaucrat in the california department of violent blockbusters, does the studio send over an aspiring actress fresh from iowa to your office? where, after an hour or so of “negotiations”, she can come back to the studio and report that “he got excited. and about your film pitch, too” . . . ? i'm not picking on california specifically, or blue states in general here. every state has some sort of commission to figure out how to lure factories and jobs to their corrupt little fiefdom. whether you're talking gigafactory, honda assembly line, amazon backup headquarters, taiwan cell phone chip factory (that never got built) or call centers and coding cube farms for out of work appalachian coal miners and their daughters. all of these boondoggles require at a minimum the suspension of taxes. and probably the suspension of disbelief and ordinary skepticism, too. if you had asked me yesterday, i would have predicted “*we're done with all this. with this pandemic era pork. loot being snagged by rappers and casinos and pot farms. we're turning our backs on this waste of tax dollars on stuff that has zero benefit for ordinary citizens*”. except, clearly, we're not done with this stuff. quentin tarantino just proved – as if any more was needed – that in america we have short attention spans and no sense of moral outrage. i'm just sayin' . ..

LINK ### public safety concerns fire hazards: abandoned vehicles can pose a significant fire risk, especially if they contain flammable materials or are left in areas prone to wildfires. by removing junk cars promptly, we can minimize the risk of accidental fires and protect both residents and the environment from potential harm. emergency response efficiency: junk cars obstruct access for emergency vehicles in case of accidents or medical emergencies. removing these vehicles ensures unimpeded access for emergency response teams, allowing them to provide timely assistance and potentially save lives. ### aesthetics and property value neighborhood revitalization: the presence of junk cars in a neighborhood can create a sense of neglect and disrepair. by removing these eyesores, we can revitalize neighborhoods, improve community pride, and create a more welcoming environment for residents and visitors. ### positive impact on property values the removal of junk cars from an area has the potential to increase property values. a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing neighborhood attracts potential buyers and boosts the overall desirability of the area, contributing to a healthier real estate market. ### economic opportunities revenue generation: junk car removal calgary services can generate revenue through the recycling and resale of salvaged parts. this revenue can be reinvested into the local economy, creating a positive economic impact and supporting small businesses in the automotive industry. job creation and skills development: the junk car removal calgary industry provides employment opportunities, particularly in the fields of vehicle dismantling, towing, and recycling. this job creation contributes to local economic growth and provides valuable skills training for individuals entering the workforce. &#x200b; LINK ### community engagement collaboration with charitable organizations: junk car removal calgary services can collaborate with charitable organizations to donate usable vehicles to those in need. by connecting with organizations that assist [low-income individuals]( LINK or support specific causes, the removal of junk cars can have a direct positive impact on the community. education and outreach: engaging in educational initiatives and outreach programs can raise awareness about responsible vehicle disposal and the benefits of junk car removal. by informing the public about the environmental and safety implications of abandoned vehicles, we can encourage responsible behavior and inspire individuals to take action. ### conclusion junk car removal is an essential service that can greatly benefit calgary in multiple ways. by addressing the environmental impact, improving public safety, enhancing aesthetics, and unlocking economic opportunities, the removal of these abandoned vehicles can contribute to a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous city. it is imperative that the government, along with community organizations and individuals, work together to prioritize and support junk car removal initiatives. by doing so, we can create a calgary that is free from the clutter of junk cars and pave the way for a more sustainable and vibrant future.",u_albertacashforcars,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_albertacashforcars/comments/16e2x9c/junk_car_removal_calgary/,0
16e2nem,"my twin sister, my dad, my friend, now my mil. is depression contagious ?","tw : mentions of self-harm and s*icide hi guys, i have had this thought for a while but it seemed silly so i did not pay attention to it. in 2019, my (28, f) twin sister went to a major depressive state due to being fired from her job. she self-harmed and went to a psychiatric facility for a few months. she is doing way better now... but last year, august 2022, it was my dad's turn. he is turning 80 and just had a major back surgery. it f'd him up to say the least. he tried to self-harm himself many times and went in a facility, but it did not go as well as my sister, to say the least. when he came home, it was worse than when he'd join the hospital. at that point, i was worrying non stop about him, going to see him at least once a week, and so on. this is why i was caught off guard in april, when a friend called me and told me that this common friend, j (28,m) had committed suicide. he was not my best friend, but we were close and talking the week before. unlike my dad and sister, his life was, seemingly, going perfect : a girlfriend, money, a job, an impressive physique... i had just learned about him passing when i went to my father's house and he opened saying he was sorry - he had hurt himself again. he went back to a facility, for a long time this time. i went at my friend's funeral and it shattered me, to say the least. this was in may. i started to see a therapist soon after, we saw each other twice since then, not much, because she feels i am, surprisingly, quite ok given the circumstances. she encouraged me to write a letter to my friend's parents with all the good memories i had with their son, and so on...in the meantime, my dad started to make real progress with a good, intensive therapy. he left the facility at the beginning of summer. he has other problems now (cognitive ones, he's elderly), but the mental part seems to be behind us. we spend a week together and it went fine. now, this just in from thursday night, my bf came home really late and incredibly upset : he just learned that his mother, 64, had called his uncle and told him she wanted to end her life. he is with her now. they have a history of mental disorders in their family, but it was never her, mostly my bf's dad. this last one draws the straw : i feel like death and self-harm is crawling around me, waiting for when i'm least waiting for it to strike, and each time i think i am safe it strikes again. is depression contagious ? why is it spreading like wildfire amongst my loved ones ? am i going to be next ? is my boyfriend ? my mum ?",mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16e2nem/my_twin_sister_my_dad_my_friend_now_my_mil_is/,0
16e206y,insurtech raincoat raises us$6.5 million to invest in financial resiliency in the wake of climate disaster,"[raincoat]( LINK a startup developing scalable climate insurance solutions that enable instantly processed individual claims, today announced the closing of an additional $6.5 million seed round bringing its total raised to date to $11 million. the funding round was led by twosigma ventures – along with european based vc firm mundi ventures, revolution’s rise of the rest seed fund and elefund. this round of capital will support the company’s expansion to new markets to provide fema-like services – much faster than existing emergency solutions – after particular disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes in the caribbean, mexico, and the gulf coast, wildfires in the west, and threats such as flood, drought, and excessive rain in colombia and brazil. this funding will continue to accelerate innovation in an industry eager for new solutions and to protect over 3 billion people and 120 million businesses at risk of being affected by natural disasters. in less than a year, raincoat has provided disaster relief protection to thousands of individuals and families with successfully executed payments in all of their active markets. today, raincoat is positioned as the fastest growing insurtech startup aimed at reinventing the industry by enabling immediate payments following climate disasters and offering coverage for losses that traditional insurance companies typically exclude. raincoat’s embedded parametric insurance model enables distribution channels to offer protection against the occurrence of a specific event given fixed parameters, such as the magnitude of the event – instead of the magnitude of losses incurred. raincoat works with financial institutions, governments, and insurers to deploy automated, end-to-end products for protecting individuals and small businesses affected by these natural disasters. the latest data reports that the total losses from natural catastrophes, including those not covered by insurance, were $270 billion in 2022. that is down from around $320 billion in 2021 and near the average of the previous five years. “we look forward to pushing the limits of what’s possible and bringing our technology to more communities thanks to this new round of capital. insurance should be there to protect you – and the expectation of payment after a catastrophe should not create anxiety – but rather bring ease,” **said jonathan gonzález, raincoat ceo and co-founder**. “we are innovating today for the current and future generations and look forward to working with more local and international players to make this happen,” he added. raincoat was founded in response to the aftermath of hurricane maría, which struck puerto rico in 2017, and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses and left millions without power and water for months. local residents, including families of the co-founders, waited on a slow and bureaucratic claim process only to be rejected months after submitting it. three years later, puerto rico alone has $1.6 billion in outstanding insurance claims that remain unpaid. “climate disaster is now happening with more frequency and intensity than ever before, and the insurance industry at present, based on manual claim adjustments that take months or even years to process, just cannot scale to match the growing risk. the world needs innovative, scalable data-driven solutions like raincoat to make businesses and families more resilient,” **said colin beirne, partner at two sigma ventures**. “investing in raincoat represents a strategic opportunity to tap into the transformative potential of parametric insurance. raincoat’s strong suit positions them as a prominent player in the industry. their offering of fully automated solutions to address climate risks at-scale sets them apart in this space,” **said moisés sánchez, general partner at mundi ventures**.",insuretech,https://www.reddit.com/r/insuretech/comments/16e206y/insurtech_raincoat_raises_us65_million_to_invest/,0

16e07xb,guys have you ever heard of a cult that knocks on your door at night?,"this was active 2 years ago and it was even broadcasted on local radio stations and even in the mainstream of our country. the social media was actively talking about it and later on, the whole story spread like a wildfire for some reason. basically, when you're at home, watching tv and just chilling on your bed, a sudden knock on your door will disturb your night. of course, it won't just be a single knock, the person outside will continue to pound on your door until you could hear the breaking sensation of the doorknob. most people who experienced this decided to open the door and met with a brutal surprise. they said that once you open the door, you will be met with a person with cloth covering the lower part of the face. if you're lucky, they will only try to drag you along with them for which you could have a chance to fight back. on the other hand, if they think you're not suited to take part on their blasphemous beliefs, they will surely unalive you. but if you decide to not open the door, the person outside will try to find another entrance to enter your house. they usually try to get in through your windows which is creepy. and if they fail to enter your house, they will eventually give up and come back another night. up until now, no one could explain the reason for such acts. no one knows what kind of cult are they and what's the purpose of it. all people are aware and afraid is just the fact that these people are looking for participants of their cult that god knows what is all about. p.s. some of them are caught by the police and they looked like regular people.

16dzauj,tifu by using my mom's wipes,"idk if this is relevant but it's my first time posting :| and also i'm a malefe (female). potential trigger: slightly talks about my butt, so leave if it bothers you lol i view this more of a silly story even though when this took place, i was in agony. so today i was getting dressed for an occasion. it was around 6am, i was taking a shower and etc.. for some basic information, i live with my mom and dad. i saw some wipes on the sink in the bathroom and decided to bring that to my room. they weren't my wipes, they were my mom's, which is already my first fuck up. normally i steal her shit because i either get curious or i get lazy lol. so of course, it had pink packaging (like most female products do), it looked all gorgeous and pretty, and even the label said ""pink grapefruit"" as the scent. for some reason my stupid ass decided to tell myself to use the wipes to wipe myself ""down there"", which is only half impulsive. when i say this is one of the most stupid decisions and choices i've ever made in my life, it definitely comes in top 5 (saying a lot). i was thinking my areas were gonna smell like ""pink grapefruit"" just out of curiosity (i really wanted to know lmfao). i wiped myself in my sensitive areas and essentially almost yelled at the sharp pain coming from my ass. out of all places i chose that place to start first, i now felt so much regret. i still continued to wipe elsewhere because i thought the pain was normal. like as if it was medicine except it's not medicine. if i wasn't already awake then i definitely was at that point. i felt another wave of an even sharper pain in between my legs. i eventually looked at the packaging and it says in tiny print ""acne prone skin wipes"" and my eyes became wide open and my heart legitimately sinks down into my socks. first of all, this is in the smallest font in the world, like what the fuck? i have 20/20 vision and i deadass felt like i was going blind just trying to read that (over exaggerating). several minutes pass by and i'm thinking to myself at this point like ""am i going to be okay?"". i had spent at least the past 30 minutes still inside the damn bathroom. i decided to call my mother, and yes i disturbed her out of her sleep to talk about my ass feeling like a blown up propane tank for other reasons being not shitting. i was borderline crying when i call her. let me tell you that i got absolutely 0 advice on how to fix my burning asshole. my mom started to tell me off and she was just absolutely livid at the fact i was touching her stuff which is reasonable so i accepted the sleepy yelling from her. she also said something along the lines of ""this is why i don't keep my stuff in the bathroom"". yeah, essentially it is my fault that i was lit on fire like santa claus falling through a chimney and into a fireplace. but i seriously don't know what i was expecting from that interaction, i just needed to let someone know so i really ended up being mad at myself. another hour passed by and i was at the location and could barely walk with the wildfire around and what felt like what was in my pants. every time i had to get up and walk i felt self conscious because of the burning. plus what didn't help was that it was actually hilariously hot and humid outside. when i was called up at the event i was at, i walked weird and sideways and i totally got some stares of confusion. the amount of embarrassment that i had caused upon my own self was immaculate. i was so uncomfortable and sweaty with just straight up anxiety lmao. i think i also tripped over my own foot in front of everyone, but that definitely is because of clumsiness. but the entire social aspect was most likely in my head because social anxiety exists. so at this moment, everyone was probably thinking about something else and not me. the burning stopped after two hours and just damn did it feel like four. in all honesty, i will never ever use my mom's shit again, that is a lesson learned. i probably wouldn't use anyone's stuff but my own. &#x200b; tl;dr: i used my mom's wipes ""down there"" thinking it was ordinary wipes. it ended up being acne prone skin wipes and i didn't see it because it was written in tiny print. mom got mad. i ended up being a sad sad person. the event i went to felt so uncomfortable. de end.",tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/16dzauj/tifu_by_using_my_moms_wipes/,0

16dywqh,"(long) my experience with daimons so far, a breakup, and how my spirit team help me reconnect with myself.","hello all, i'd like to share my experience with daimons so far. apologies if it's fragmented and reads weird. i just want to share my whole experience thus far, as i'm sure the couple friends i've been telling are tired of me lol. i have meditated all my life. i began rediscovering myself again relatively recently; leading me to rediscover my love for spirit/astral work, and the history of magic as a topic of research from my teenage years. i began reading tarot for a few months, then witchcraft for about 6 months, then spirit work. i was called to hekate and morrigan first, and started practicing witchcraft more as a spiritual practice (general connection with nature); then i began ancestor work. that all lead me to demonolatry, about a month and a half at this point. i think i have a pretty strong intuition that comes from my gut and i'd noticed that when i call out to spirits my right ear rings or the hearing becomes less? it's hard to explain. when i notice a strong presence i feel it behind my right ear and into the front of my neck and right shoulder. one day i was walking away from the beach, on the boardwalk. i'd been asking for help from spirit out loud. i audibly heard ""ok"" in my right ear. i have never turned around so fast in my life. i am a pretty skepitcal person, but that was the first time i'd ever experienced something like that. since then, i have remained hyper vigilant at whether or not any experience i am having is due to spiritual psychosis. which i think is a good way to go about it tbh. this happened *riiiiiight* before i discovered demonolatry. lilith called to me shortly after this. after some time meditating with lilith came the remainder of her sisters; lilith ultimately told me that they were there when my parents ""decided to stop being parents"" in one meditation/prayer session. a thought that i don't believe could have ever originated from my own thoughts. i had been researching all the goetic daimons, as one does. not sure where i read it, but i'd learned that king agares was a funny guy; which i appreciated. that night i dreamt of an old man with a crown riding a croc in a river, peeking out of some cattails. he was speaking through his croc, but it was detatched like the canadians from south park; hilarious. i was very excited. i'd never dreamt of any specific spirit/diety so far. so i drew his sigil on my window sill, as i had with everyone else so far. however i mistitled him as ""duke"" agares instead of king agares; important later, obviously. i made a pendulum and began working with that. i chose to work with my spirit team vs my own intuition for divination. i had done about 10 sessions previously; then in one particular session i felt something through my ear/neck. i began asking who all was with me: >i asked if the daimons were with me, they said yes; and they also confirmed they are always with me. >i asked if hekate and morrigan were with me, the answer to that is always no. >i asked if there was anything/anyone else with me, yes. >more than one? no. >one of my ancestors? yes. when i call out to my ancestors, i specifically say: ""my ancestors and ancestors to be"". so i also meant my ex's acestors as well, as i was so sure we were getting married. i have a specific necklace that i wore, where i stated that ancestors and spirits may find me if i was wearing it and for everyone to leave and give me privacy if i wasn't. something i practice a lot less now, lol. i had had an image of my bedroom door with a shadow in front of it, and when i acknowledged that in my mind the image would go black and the shadow would turn white but it's eyes red and it would scream without break; which i changed it's screaming to a funny noise as i felt i had a right to peace in my own mind... and it violated my rules with the necklace. so back to the pendulum divination. i confirmed that this presence was the late brother of my partner's grandfather. i got a full name, i got birth and death dates, and i got the reason he came to me. the reason being that i was to send him on his way after, specifically within 25 years. i asked if i was to invoke god, buddha, yhwh, etc. to do so. all no's. then who? i asked. he spelled out ""y o u"". crazy shit. i made it abundantly clear that what he was asking me to do would take a lot of research and a lot of time; when i asked if he was ok with that he said yes. okay! this is exciting, i thought. i'd better tell my ex, i thought. i should not have thought. it didn't go well; even though they were very supportive of my practices previously. we argued and as we are both autistic we decided we needed time to process; we broke up in this waiting time, and i am currently still waiting for them to message me. which is fine, i'm human, i'm allowed to hang on. i began to research more and i came across more about ***king*** agares. oh. shit. i go to correct the title next to the sigil. i apologize and all. i'd then asked if he'd done this, the break up, i mean. i whipped out the pendulum to ask more specific questions: >did you do this to teach me a lesson? yes. >i'm mad, is it ok that i'm mad about it? yes. >do you forgive me now? yes. >is it ok that i don't forgive you for some time? yes. >can you undo it? no. ultimately we had a conversation where king agares said that, even though you were doing the things that your partner was saying they wanted me to do/not doing things they wanted me to do, you would not have done them and fully committed to doing/not doing those things. so, next time, keep this in mind. fully commit, don't half ass. in later meditations with king agares, i forgave him and said ""maaaan, that was fucked up... but i admit that it was funny. fucked up, but funny."" the image of him, that came to me in the dream, came to me and he and his croc had a chuckle. eventually he said he, personally (i am aware some do care), doesn't *actually* care about the mistitling, he just wanted to frame the lesson in a way that i would understand. still, i'll always be careful to not mistitle anyone in the future. whenever i'm struggling in a moment, i make it a point to say that i don't doubt their methods and the necessity of the specific lesson; but i also acknowledge and express ""this sucks, why couldn't you guys teach me another way?"". i don't even remember exactly how king paimon came to me, as i was in the absolute despair part of the break up, but he did. as king paimon has very distinct and powerful energy, it's very obvious when he's with me and wants to speak with me. a couple more days after i invoked him, i felt him again. i pleaded ""please let me cry every tear i have for them"" and boy did i. king paimon wrung me out like a wet towel. a couple days later, while in the shower, i got the idea that i needed to mourn who i was in the relationship as well; i approached it with the intention to write a pseudo-spell/words of power for myself only. i got the general outline done in my head by the time i finished the shower and got back to my room to write it down. then i noticed his presence again. i ended up writing this, while bawling my eyes out, with king paimon's assitance: >let this rain fully extinguish the person i was before. although i have doubted a flame or spark ever existed within him; it is clear now within him was an uncontained wildfire. let him die, do not mourn him; he would not have mourned me. let this water that wash over me extinguish his wild and untamed flame. extinguish the flame of any that you have nurtured from when he passed the torch in our lowest, most sorrowful moment. yes, even my current flame. it is time to alight it anew. he threw the torch at me, lashing out in fear. do not catch it. let his flame die, let our flames die. listen to the sizzle of the flame being extinguished; listen to the last coals, the last embers, finally die out. feel the steam of our extinguished flames. >i ask for my new spark, my new fire to be pointed and focused. although i do not know what my intentions, my purpose, or my passions are now; i will nurture my spark and my flame so that it may burn brightly and with purpose. let me borrow holy or infernal flame, any flame, at first and for a time, because i am lost. >i am so lost. >so very lost. >lost in his destruction that is in every direction i look. >eventually, i will find myself. i know i will. >let my new flame cast away his shadows. he will resist, as they were his only friends; and they, too, will resist. let my new flame burn bright enough so that they cannot rise from the ashes. if they return, i will embrace them with love and kindness. we will embrace and they will burn away, back to the void whence they came. he will mourn them, but do not comfort him; it is not your pain to grieve. as he fizzles out; listen and acknowledge his pain. observe his boundless destruction. be with it for one last moment, hold his pain dear one last time, then return it to the ground you stand on. >he did not want this, i did not want this, we did not want this. >he was lost. >he was alone. >he was only a boy without help >he was only a boy without. >he was only a boy. >he was only a boy. >and he was alone. >when i am done contemplating his destruction, i will search for him. he will arise out of the ashes. i must let him know he is not alone now. he will be too weak to walk, so i will carry him. i will carry him for as long as it takes. he is mine and i am his. i am proud he survived. he is in awe that i could have made it this far. i remind him that he made it this far. >*we* made it this far. >when he has regained his strength, i will teach him to walk. i will take his hand, and we will walk a path together; any path. it may not be the path, but we will walk it together. >we will walk it together, and i will teach him everything he wishes. no matter how small or seemingly insignificant; i will nurture his every curiosity and wonder. so that i, too, will begin to wonder again. >our flames will reunite and be as one. >we may choose to blaze our own trail later, but now is not the time. now is the time to simply be with each other. >to know that we are not alone anymore. >we are not alone anymore. >we are not alone. >i am not alone. ^writing ^is ^also ^another ^thing ^i ^forgot ^i ^had ^an ^affinity ^for ^in ^my ^teenage ^years, ^lol. i shared this with a couple important people, so this may out me; but i don't care anymore lol. my mantra since the breakup has been: ""welp, i've got nothing else to lose man_shrugging "" king paimon taught me that it's also important to mourn *yourself* in regard to trauma and the version of yourself holding on to deeply ingrained/long-running negative habits; the subconscious defensive habits that prevent you from feeling the necessary feelings to *truly* do healing and processing. after this a friend reached out to me, and helped me by telling me to just behave as if my ex already said no to getting back together. she even took me to a volunteer for a concert, and we attended it because we got free tickets for doing so. it is now my belief that the best offerings i can give to my spirit team are the emotions that i am should be feeling in any given situation, and the actions i need to make toward my self improvement. *especially* concerning the lessons they want to teach me. experiencing everything this world has to offer, including the emotions - maybe even especially the emotions, *has* to be the ultimate lesson; at least it is for me, personally. i also believe that the ladies - *hekate, morrigan, lilith, aggereth, naamah, eisheth zenunim* - who came to me initially were teaching me to do so freely and confidently; as they all teach sovereignty. i had been very afraid to do anything or talk to anyone before. i still am, but much less so. so now, every now and then i feel compelled to express the appreciation and love i have for them and their presence in my life: >i love you all. >i love you king paimon. >i love you king agares. >i love you lilith. >i love you agrat bat mahlat. >i love you naamah. >i love you eisheth zenunim. >i love you king asmodeus. >i love you duchess bune. >i love you duke dantalion. >i love you president camio. and i say this before i go to bed more often than not. i'm sure the absoulte whirlwind of spiritual involvement will become less intense/frequent as time passes the events of the breakup; because i know how insane this probably looks, even to experienced practitioners. the breakup has not even been 2 weeks ago at this point. well, maybe it will maybe it won't. they help me to reconnect to and recontextualize my emotions, how to be my true self, how to shed everything that is not truly me (an important distinction to make, i think), and how to *really* be present. these are things i'd been struggling with; especially as i learned more about my brain - as an adult - in the ways of asd, adhd, and childhood trauma... which has gotta be so much harder than having known/been diagnosed since you were a kid, right? something about old dogs? **even though i still moments of weakness here and there; for the first time in my life, i don't dissociate everything away and i feel human.** idk why i felt compelled to write this, but thanks for reading. = if i could ask about your experiences, reader: * how do you experience the presence of the spirits you work with? * what sorts of things have you received help with? * have the spirits you work with tricked you; even though they're not *traditionally* known as ""tricksters""? edited to add a funny detail: lilith had warned me to not be so forthcoming with my practices to my ex, before king agares came to me, but i ignored the warning or didn't realize it was a warning to begin with.",DemonolatryPractices,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemonolatryPractices/comments/16dywqh/long_my_experience_with_daimons_so_far_a_breakup/,0

16dxssu,sm 9223 b accuracy/error,"tried a lot of googling, not getting anything. is there any stated accuracy or allowable error for the total colliform number on a quantitative sm 9223 b (quanti tray 18) test? i have a spring source that feeds a summer camp and we are around 2.0 for total present (but <1.0 for e. coli) for last several weeks (tested weekly) and trying to figure out if we are down in the noise floor, or should still be worried. spring was good for 10+ years but wildfire and a crazy winter in the west is causing issues. oddly enough campgrounds in a 90 mile radius are having similar water issues on sources that were great for years. thank you!",WaterTreatment,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterTreatment/comments/16dxssu/sm_9223_b_accuracyerror/,0

16dxs7z,covid = constant migraine,"covid spread around my workplace like wildfire this week. i tested positive last night, and have been moved to a quarantine dorm in my building for the next 5-10 days. (my school still has very strict precautions goin on, but sadly my job simply does not.) not allowed to leave the dorm room im in until at least tuesday, and that’s if i start testing negative. so far i’m on hour 50+ of a migraine, plus all the other covid symptoms. i usually am able to sleep off migraines/take something for them, but no luck this time. anyone have any advice for dealing with covid?? i had it back in dec 2021, but my chronic illness was incredibly mild at that point (covid caused the ramp up of many symptoms, plus i got mono less than a month after recovering from covid) im dyin out here man",ChronicIllness,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/16dxs7z/covid_constant_migraine/,0

16dx1qu,(spoilers published) changes i would have made to the targaryen-blackfyre family and history,"i tried posting this on r/citadel, but there seemed to be some difficulties. this is just something i came up with over the years, partly to change many of the women giving birth at 15 or younger, working with asoiaf lore and the crusader kings ii mod as guides. i'm going to be dividing these up by monarch. if it isn't mentioned, it happened much the same as it did iotl: **aegon i, aenys & maegor:** * aenys and maegor are born in 2 ac and 5 ac respectively, instead of 7 ac and 11 ac. * alysanne is now the daughter of maegor and ceryse hightower, and is now born in 34 ac instead of 36 ac (so that she is pregnant with aegon at 17 instead of 15). * prince nymor martell sends princess deria to king's landing to bend the knee to aegon. * aenys and alyssa's daughter, vaella, survives. this will be important later. * while in exile, maegor has an illegitimate son by tyanna of pentos, aerion waters (b. 42 ac). however, when maegor becomes king, he refuses to legitimize aerion, leading tyanna to poison his other wives and their children to leave maegor with no choice. you can guess how well that ends. after maegor kills tyanna, he cuts out aerion's tongue so that, on top of being a bastard son of a traitor, no one would support him. when maegor dies, aerion is killed by ser maladon moore of the kingsguard to try and gain jaehaerys' favour. **jaehaerys i, viserys i & the dance of the dragons:** * traumatised by her uncle's reign, princess vaella marries rodrik arryn to get away from king's landing. she floruishes in the vale, taking up falconing and becoming more outgoing. she becomes the mother of rodrik's children, and thus the grandmother of lady jeyne arryn. aemma arryn here is the daughter of rodrik and vaella's younger son and the elder sister of arnold arryn, so still a cousin of viserys i but not a first cousin. vaella dies in 99 ac after both encouraging the marriage between aemma and viserys i and supporting jeyne's claim as lady of the eyrie. * gaemon, valerion, gael and aegon (son of baelon and alyssa) are now children of prince aemon and jocelyn baratheon. the deaths of three sons in infancy wears both of them down, leading them to be protective and indulgent of their daughters, including allowing rhaenys to marry corlys velaryon, which causes a rift between aemon and jaehaerys that never fully heals. * alyssa takes part in the fourth dornish war (now a rebellion by prince morion) alongside her father and brothers. it is only after the battle, when the dragons land, that it is discovered that she was killed by crossbow bolts. * daella's appearance as a frightened, simple girl is a ruse, what she calls her ""fluffy bunny act"". here, she is married to royce blackwood instead of rodrik arryn, and becomes the grandmother of samwell blackwood, and the grandmother of alysanne and benjicot blackwood. though they love each other, their devotion to the old gods and the seven respectively is a lingering source of tension, and when daella learns about red robb rivers, she no longer trusts her husband. she dies in 136 ac, having outlived all her siblings. * saera and viserra are sent to the faith at an early age, similar to maegelle, but after saera runs away to lys in 85 ac, viserra is summoned back to king's landing. * viserra is betrothed to desmond manderly, instead of his great-grandfather, the elderly theomore manderly. * gael's lover is now prince daemon, who marries her in a secret ceremony. after gael's miscarriage and suicide, alysanne arranges daemon's match with rhea royce as a punishment. * rhaenyra is born in 98 ac instead of 97 ac. * aegon ii and helaena are born in 106 and 108 ac respectively, instead of 107 and 109 ac. here, viserys marries alicent both out of affection and to preserve her honour when they learn she is pregnant with aegon. * jaehaerys and jaehaera are born in 124 ac instead of 123 ac. * daemon and laena's twisted and malformed son, which died in canon, instead lives, but mocked and loathed by nearly everyone. kept out of sight on dragonstone, aenys 'the hunchback' sneaks out to try and tame a dragon and prove himself, and ends up finding the elusive grey ghost, with the two bonding over their mutual dislike of people. during the dance of the dragons, aenys runs away to find and live with grey ghost, they end up dying at the hands of aegon ii and sunfyre. * qoren martell uses the chaos of the dance of the dragons to declare himself prince of dorne, independent from the iron throne once more. the civil war and the regency and rebuilding of aegon iii's reign gives dorne a generation of independence from the iron throne without fear of dragons. **aegon iii, viserys ii & their children:** * daenaera velaryon is now born in 120 ac instead of 127 ac. * daeron i, baelor, daena, rhaena and elaena are now born in 140 ac, 142 ac, 144 ac, 146 ac and 148 ac respectively, instead of 143 ac, 144 ac, 145 ac, 147 ac and 150 ac. * after his initial conquest of dorne, daeron i marries daena, has baelor married to rhaena (which remains unconsummated), betroths elaena to the son of the sealord of braavos during his second war, and leaves daeron the younger to his own devices, thinking/hoping that the bookish boy would eventually go to the citadel. * soon after daeron i's murder, daena gives birth to a boy, aegon iv, who lives and reigns for just five days. ten years later, when viserys ii becomes king, he plans to marry daena off to a low-ranking lord or landed knight, but she runs away to essos before he gets the chance. viserys decides to focus on running the kingdom instead of finding her, and aegon 'the unworthy' doesn't care enough to look for her. * the short-lived twins of aegon v 'the unworthy' and naerys are named aerys and aerea, princess daenerys's stillborn brother is named viserys, and during her final fatal childbirth, naerys lives long enough to name the child aemon, after her recently deceased brother. **daeron ii, his sons and his grandchildren:** * after baelor breakspear dies at ashford and daeron ii during the great spring sickness, baelor's son, valarr, lives long enough to become king, but spends his five month reign bedridden. with his brother matarys (who had hoped to join the kingsguard), and his twins by kiera of tyrosh dead, the iron throne passes to his uncle aerys i. * prince rhaegel remains unmarried until the first blackfyre rebellion, when he is married to alys arryn to get the vale on the targaryen side. they only have two children - twins aelor and aelora, born in 197 ac. * aerys i's wife, queen aelinor penrose, is frustrated by her husband's refusal to consummate their marriage, especially after they come to the throne. in 212 ac, when bloodraven is at whitewalls, aelinor smothers aerys to death in a fit of rage, but is captured before she can escape. rhaegel becomes king, but power resides in the hands of his wife and his brother, maekar, the new hand, who demote bloodraven to master of whispers. * rhaegel and alys, despite their sympathy for aelinor's position, believe they cannot let the murder of a king go unpunished, so they offer aelinor a choice - execution or the silent sisters. aelinor chooses the latter. * in regards to the newly imprisoned daemon ii blackfyre, rhaegel, alys and maekar, in a combined show of magnanimity and attempt to goad the blackfyres in tyrosh into acting, sentence daemon ii to join the night's watch. bittersteel makes no attempt to save him. * princess daenora is here the daughter of aelor and aelora, born in 214 ac. a year later, when rhaegel chokes to death at a feast, aelor comes to the throne. he, aided by maekar, leads targaryen forces in the third blackfyre rebellion, reluctantly allowing aerion brightflame (who killed haegon i blackfyre when he attempted to surrender) back from exile. * king aelor 'the valiant' dies in 221 ac after a jousting accident. he and aelora had two sons, baelor (b. 216 ac, d. 218 ac) amd rhaegel (b. 219 ac, d. 220 ac), but both predeceased him, so the crown passes to maekar. * maekar's wife, dyanna dayne, lives until the tragedy of summerhall. * maekar reinstates bloodraven as hand of the king, marries daeron the drunken to lady kiera of tyrosh, valarr's widow, and aerion brightflame to queen dowager aelora, and betroths daenora to raymont baratheon. here, ormund and harbert are lord lyonel's grandsons instead of his sons, though prince duncan's bride (who would become the mother of aemon estermont and grandmother of alyn estermont) is still lyonel's daughter. * daeron the drunken spends his wedding night with kiera drunk. nine months to the day, kiera gives birth to a daughter, vaella (b. 222 ac), but by then daeron has long abandoned her. * aelora gives birth to a son, whom aerion names maegor (b. 222 ac), and then plays on aerion's ego to convince him to become a dragon by drinking wildfire. aerions' body is barely cold before aelora joins the faith and becomes a septa. * daella, after a brief affair with duncan the tall, is married off to lord tarth, and rhaena, maekar and dyanna's younger daughter, is married to lord velaryon, becoming the mother of lucerys velaryon, aerys ii's master of ships. **the blackfyres:** * daemon blackfyre and rohanne of tyrosh have only seven children, as opposed to the twelve in canon: * twins **aegon and aemon** (b. 184 ac, died at redgrass field), **calla** (b. 186 ac), **daemon ii** (b. 188 ac), **haegon i** (b. 190 ac, d. 219 ac), **aenys** (b. 192 ac, d. 233 ac), **viserys** (b. 194 ac, d. 251 ac), and **daena** (b. 196 ac). after redgrass field, they are taken to tyrosh by rohanne and bittersteel. * instead of marrying bittersteel (a match which, according to grrm, produced no children), calla blackfyre instead marries her brother haegon, as part of an attempt by the blackfyres to accentuate their valyrian-ness. as part of said attempt, aenys is eventually married to daena. viserys blackfyre chooses to remain unmarried and takes over command of the golden company after bittersteel's death in 240 ac until his own death in 251 ac. * haegon i and calla have four children - **daemon iii** (b. 206 ac), **aegor** (b. 208 ac), **rhaena** (b. 210 ac) and **baelon** (b. 213 ac). daemon iii marries aegor and rhaena together while he marries a tyroshi noblewoman. baelon disappears before they launch their third invasion, and daemon and aegor both die at the battle of wendwater bridge. daemon iii and his wife had two children, **daenerys** (b. 226 ac) and **haegon** (b. 228 ac), the latter of whom dies at wendwater bridge while serving as his father's squire. * after haegon's death, blackfyre is reclaimed by the targaryens. * aegor and rhaena blackfyre has one son, **daemon iv** in 226 ac. he is married to his cousin, daenerys, and they have three sons - **daemon** (b. 243 ac), **aegor** (b. 245 ac) and **aenys** (b. 247 ac), and takes control of the golden company after the death viserys blackfyre in 251 ac. hearing of the westerosi nobility's disaffection with aegon the unlikely, daemon plans for his attempt to take the throne and throws himself into his role as captain-general to gain enough gold for it. * aenys and daena have only one son - **maelys the monstrous** (b. 212 ac). he is married to a tyroshi noblewoman and they have two sons - **aegon** (b. 240 ac), a cruel brute, and **baelon** (b. 242 ac), a dragon dreamer. his cousin baelon always picked on him, and on the eve of the third blackfyre rebellion, maelys gets baelon alone and pushes him off the ramparts to his death. after killing daemon iv for control of the golden company, he captures his surviving relatives, including his own mother, and sells them into slavery for gold. * aegon blackfyre marries another tyroshi noblewoman and has twins - viserys and viserra in 257 ac. after the deaths of maelys and his sons on the stepstones, aegon's wife flees with her children to lys... **egg and his descendants:** * duncan the small, jaehaerys ii, shaena, daeron and rhaelle are born in 220 ac, 222 ac, 224 ac, 227 ac and 229 ac respectively. * following bloodraven's exile, he is not allowed to take dark sister. both it and blackfyre disappear during tywin's sack of king's landing. * after maegor targaryen is passed over at the great council of 233 ac, egg grants him ownership of daemon blackfyre's former keep on the blackwater, which is renamed from blackfyre keep to brightflame keep. queen dowager alys arryn arranges for maegor to marry vaella, and they have three children - a son, aelor (b. 241) and two daughters, daenora (b. 238 ac) and alyssa (b. 243 ac). maegor, knowing that the nobles already rejected him once for the throne, tries to get prince aerys to marry daenora, and then alyssa when daenora joins the faith, but this fails when aerys is betrothed to his own sister, rhaella. maegor marries aelor and alyssa to each other, but any future plans are scuppered after maegor, vaella, aelor and alyssa perish at summerhall. * prince duncan and jenny of oldstones have one child, a son named aemon after the dragonknight. because the birth is difficult, duncan and jenny decide not to have any more children. aemon grows up ashamed of the circumstances of his birth, feeling that he is no better than a bastard. he escapes the tragedy of summerhall, but then dies during the war of ninepenny kings in a suicide attack against maelys. it's not much, and i'm open to constructive criticism, but it was fun to come up with, at least.",asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16dx1qu/spoilers_published_changes_i_would_have_made_to/,0

16du3q6,insurance broker/underwriter recommendations? help,"hello good people of reddit, my wife and i are in the process of buying the house we are currently renting from our landlord. this is something we have been working toward for the past 2 years and we are finally at the point where everything is good to go. we have a signed and accepted offer, mortgage approval from the bank, and closing on the 21st. there's just one really big problem: we're in west kelowna, bc which was affected by a wildfire on august 18th. as a result, none of the insurance agencies we have called can sell policies in west kelowna, even though our neighborhood is well inside town and was never in any danger, even at the height of the fire. the fire turned after burning some houses and is now still burning far out in the backcountry so technically not ""under control"" unfortunately. in the meantime, the landlord/seller's health has been failing fast (he is in his late 80s) and he may well not be able to complete the sale in a few weeks. he may also have a backup cash buyer that would be able to step in if we can't close on the 21st. so long story short we urgently need home insurance and don't care what it costs but have been unable to find anything. are there any insurance agencies/underwriters that would look at our specific case and charge according to the perceived risk? rather than just blacklisting our entire postal code? tl:dr : urgently need recommendations for home insurance agents/underwriters that would consider selling a policy in a fire zone on a case by case basis when other underwriters blacklist the whole area?",RealEstateCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/16du3q6/insurance_brokerunderwriter_recommendations_help/,0

16dt7h2,forestry career w/o related degree (22 years-old),"hey all, looking to potentially find a career in forestry in the western united states. currently, i have a b.s. in leadership and organizational management, which translates to hr. however, based on the research i've done, a forestry career in state or federal government looks appealing due to: 4 10s, working outside, benefits, not taking work home, and potential to occassionally help out with wildfire. i know the pay isn't the best, and that it can be difficult to land a permanent position. what i am the most confused about is how one would move from a forestry tech position ""up the ladder"" to other better paying, more stable, more office work positions topping out in the $80k+. ideally, that amount of money and still having the ability to work in the field relatively frequently would be great 7-10 years down the road, if possible. additionally, i am considering a crew member position through ace as a sort of ""internship."" i am new to this, so i apologize for any naive comments or unrealistic expectations. any insight/advice would be greatly appreciated as this appears to be a career i could enjoy!",forestry,https://www.reddit.com/r/forestry/comments/16dt7h2/forestry_career_wo_related_degree_22_yearsold/,0

16dolq0,do you think it's possible the new testament letters are fabricated?,"and that they're designed to look like letters to introduce or further religious teachings? i think the incentive is there for some fucked up human trash to do this whether it be the money someone can make off of being a scribe writing down the letters, or introducing religious concepts or furthering religious concepts, that it seems plausible people could have just written documents looking like letters. same goes with the gospels, they could have just been made up working off of the isaiah prophecy of a suffering messiah. what i don't get is how there could be churches in jerusalem, where someone could go ""this stuff never fucking happened"", but i guess given enough people being there and our seeming innate helplessness when it comes to this stuff people could still believe. this is kind of an aside, but surely dead people coming back to life and going back into the city like i think is described in matthew would fucking change things dramatically there, news of that would spread like wildfire and one would think it wouldn't be solely contained in a fucking gospel. experiencing something like that would be life changing and i would expect jerusalem to be radically changed by something like that and the news affecting other parts of the world as well. i mean there would be people who were fucking dead walking around in a city and going back to their lives, how the fuck could that not change everything? it doesn't make sense to me that the writing about this happening is contained in one fucking gospel (unless i'm wrong about that somehow, but i think it's only in matthew).",atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/16dolq0/do_you_think_its_possible_the_new_testament/,0

are strong but we are all very nice people and openly welcome new players! <3 some things that have occurred to keep in mind notes wise(these notes are courtesy of our faithful note taking centaur! frejlord: in the icy realm of frejlord, a chilling tale unfolds, filled with treachery, mystery, and the clash of titanic forces. it all began with a sinister plot involving the enigmatic alchemist, singed, who unleashed a plague of undead horrors upon the unsuspecting town, only to be revealed as an unintended consequence of a zombie infestation lurking in the shadows of the sewers. the blame was wrongly cast upon singed, forcing him to embark on a quest for a cure, which eventually granted him deliverance from the vile virus. meanwhile, amidst the turmoil, a great war erupted between the formidable leaders of frejlord: lissandra, ashe, and sejuani. in a fateful twist of fate, your intrepid band chose to ally with the noble and courageous ashe, fighting bravely on the front lines and ultimately emerging victorious, bringing an end to the bloody conflict. yet, there was a deeper and darker force at play. enter the boogeyman, known as babayaga or solomon, an arch-lich who had once challenged the very gods themselves during the epoch of the great war. this malevolent entity had ensnared lissandra, tainting her heart and twisting her into a maleficent puppet. as your group crossed paths with this ancient and immensely potent being, it was evident that he had awakened from his slumber, wielding unimaginable power even in his nascent state. amidst these trials and tribulations, your party's heartwarming journey took a tender turn. moved by compassion and benevolence, they chose to embrace orphans and carve a new beginning through the establishment of an orphanage. it was a testament to their pure spirits, and the druid among you emphasized the need for new companions to appreciate and cherish the company of the little ones. zaun/piltover: in the vibrant and bustling cities of zaun and piltover, their journey took a compelling turn, leading them to the heart of two metropolises intertwined by ingenuity and mystery. as the lingering marks of the past's poison stirred, they ventured to zaun in search of a cure. within the confines of this alchemical marvel, they found respite and healing, the poisons purged from their body by the expertise of zaunite healers. fortune favored them further when a gracious invitation brought them to a grand hospital in piltover, a marvel of architectural brilliance. however, this visit took an unexpected twist when an unfortunate soul was ruthlessly assassinated within the very walls of the esteemed establishment. the eerie echoes of a murder mystery beckoned you to uncover the truth. upon delving deeper, the intrepid group uncovered a shocking revelation—the targets of these murders were none other than corrupt heads of research within the hospital. their malevolence threatened the very foundation of this prestigious institution. but the plot thickened, and the web of intrigue extended beyond the confines of the hospital. it was revealed that the ""savior,"" a friend of the corrupt researchers, had become ensnared by the sinister machinations of solomon. this once benevolent soul had succumbed to corruption, even slaying his own family under the dark influence. in a somber yet necessary act, the group put an end to his suffering and freed him from the grip of darkness, sparing him from further torment. yet, the true enigma lay with the enigmatic figure of solomon. their investigations unveiled that his nefarious plans extended to ionia, where the world tree stood, its fate in jeopardy. a powerful force such as solomon could tip the delicate balance of ionia, and the very heart of nature itself was at risk. ionia: in a breathtaking twist of fate, the revelation of the world tree's impending demise struck like thunder, casting a shadow of despair over their journey. the urgency of the situation demanded swift action, and the adventurers set forth on a quest to seek a cure, hoping to save the very heart of ionia. amidst this perilous endeavor, tragedy struck close to home when the father of one of the players was brutally assassinated. the heartache of loss intensified the stakes, strengthening the resolve to unmask the culprits behind this heinous act. as your group pursued justice, the tendrils of the sinister cultists of solomon began to emerge. their dark influence stretched across lands and realities, threatening to plunge the world into chaos. with valor and cunning, the group thwarted the cultists' sinister machinations, putting an end to their malevolent plot. but the greatest revelation awaited—the cure for the dying world tree, the essence of life itself, was within your grasp. as the adventurers unlocked the secrets to saving the world tree, an unexpected miracle unfolded. the cure not only revitalized the ancient tree but the tree also brought back the father of the grieving companion. a reunion filled with tears of joy, an awe-inspiring testament to the power of hope and perseverance. yet, amidst this miraculous triumph, the specter of solomon loomed once more. the enigmatic adversary revealed himself anew, slipping away through a mysterious portal that led to bilgewater—a city steeped in its own legends and tales of daring pirates and dark secrets. bilgewater: the land the group currently resides! in this land of turmoil and opportunity, the four formidable contenders—miss fortune, gangplank, twisted fate, and graves—vie for dominance, each seeking to claim the ancient artifacts of old. legends speak of twelve sacred relics that, when united, possess the power to grant any wish, a force that can reshape reality itself. among the contenders, gangplank stands tall with a newfound advantage—a sinister alliance with the enigmatic solomon. the dark and powerful being provides gangplank with an edge, one that makes his bid for the artifacts all the more formidable. in this crucible of power, alliances are fleeting, and treachery is ever-present. the stakes are immeasurable, for the consequences of the victor's wish could reshape not only bilgewater but the entire realm of runeterra. \-while the group has had plenty of other shenanigans, these are the main plot points that have occurred so far, if you are invited to the group you are more than welcome to pick their brains for all that has occurred! while you may have your character be from any of the lands, keep in mind that the main arcs for frejlord, zaun/piltover, and ionia have already concluded and resolved so while the party may go back to these lands for various reasons, your backstory may be in the backburner for awhile if you are from these lands. about the group: \-there is no age requirement but i do recommend being 18 and up or at least having the maturity of being able to handle mature themes such as abuse, slavery, sexual acts, debauchery, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution \-currently we have 3 players! all players are level 10! a tiefling circle of wildfire druid, an artificer human tinkerer, and a centaur fey wanderer ranger. \-this is a big journey. i'll understand if you drop out if you aren't interested but if you are...be aware this adventure could take years to finish. it's once a week 4 hours for a couple years. think about it. it's an investment. \-time is a difficult issue for most people. i myself work full time and am only able to meet one day a week for a 5 hour session! please be aware and be able to meet this time before applying! the time in question is 10 am-2 pm pst time every tuesday. obviously i understand life gets in the way at times but please be able to meet this time consistently if you plan to join our adventure! \- the adventure will be filled with fighting, roleplay, exploration, free roaming, storytelling, a little railroading when necessary, but of course fun! i'd say 60-40, story/roleplaying and combat. general rules for my campaign: \- lgbtq+ friendly \- avrae bot, roll20, and discord will be the platform base but i'm okay with you using your own dice as long as you're honest with your rolls. i usually dm with my own dice but avrae is really nifty if you don't have your own dice \-we started at level 3 and are now level 10! \- standard array, point buy, or you can roll for your stats! \-must be willing to disconnect the player from the person, don't bring unnecessary drama into the group (don't take things personally) \-must be willing to allow others to shine. (play nice with one another) \-must be willing to work with the group and not be destructive for no reason. ( no murder hobo ) \-must be willing to accept consequences for actions in-game and death of characters. \-must be willing to attend games regularly and on time. \-there may be some flirting or mature themes but no pure nsfw content, the most things will get to is fade to black \-you may multiclass but please approve any homebrew content with me first such as classes, race, or items \-previous knowledge of league of legends is not mandatory but if this campaign interests you than i recommend either learning or having some base knowledge but no meta gaming. you can get excited when you see a champion you like but don't put your assumptions of what you know into the campaign...it doesn't end well \-roleplay is extremely important in my opinion. become your character, make decisions based on what they'd do from their experiences and past, build them, make a voice, play as them. i don't really do alignments but if it impacts how you play then go for it. just don't be a murderhobo who says ""it's what my character would do."" \-you don't need a webcam to play or join but you do need a mic and i recommend having a webcam as it helps me see when people are disinterested or want to move on with a plot. \-we do not use encumbrance (ew coin weight? i don't want to count that) but that doesn't mean you can pick up a rock every 3 seconds just to have on your person and sell later. i will find a puddle that is deep enough for you to drown in, don't tempt me. \-rewards. we like loot. loot is good. we like the feeling of accomplishment from killing a big bad evil guy and getting a bunch of gold, but standard dnd uses loot in a way of throwing away or selling old weapons and getting new ones. i do something completely different. in the beginning of the game within 5 or 6 sessions you will find yourself a weapon. a unique custom designed weapon i have made for you that will grow with you as your character becomes stronger. you will get other loot sure that you will use on your travels and use in unique situations but this weapon will be bound with you forever and be your best friend. \-speaking of gold. tony, how do we get rewarded for our adventures if we get custom made weapons that grow with us? i'm glad you asked. i think dnd can be too easy at times. gold, gold, gold everywhere and you just find magic items in chests sometimes. sure sometimes those chests are mimics but still. well. it is not quite that easy my friend. everything is sellable and everything is expensive. you'll find loot sure. maybe some gems, some dragon bones, you'll get the hide off a deer, some parchment of tales of a famous artifact, some fragments of a broken weapon. but earning money takes time and when you finally do have (if you read this far then congrats! message me secret word: higgledebum to earn bonus points/chance to get in!) enough to spend on that doohickey, staff, flame cloak, magic headband, returning dagger, poison pouch, or magic tattoo you've been eyeing for 7 sessions....it'll be all the more rewarding. i think oversaturation is a big problem in dnd. it should take time and be ever more rewarding when you get cool new stuff. it isn't just handed to you. you gotta earn that shit with blood, sweat, and tears. \-realism is a big part of dnd but it's only as real as you make it. your characters need to eat, sleep, and heal but i'm not going to keep track of every daily expense and force you to pay it every time \-i am a huge sucker for backstory. i love it. if you join please be prepared to write a unique backstory that i can include in the campaign. this isn't college there are no minimum or maximum requirements but give me more to work with and the more i can add to the campaign! maybe your mother was murdered and you need to track down her killer? (hey if you've read this far then kudos! here's the second secret word! potatoskins! don't worry it's the last one) maybe you got dissed that one time while playing on the streets for coin and you want to find him and prove you're an amazing bard? maybe some guy robbed you and you want to track him down and torture him? make it interesting make it unique! note\*: if this post is still up and not closed it means i have not made any decisions yet and am still taking/looking at applications! <3 please do be patient with me as i am taking my time and looking at all applications and thinking a lot before making any decisions! i will respond to all applications whether or not you get in however! to apply \-interested in joining? i don't blame you, if you're interested in joining this campaign then send me a private message on reddit with a handful of things: \- name and pronouns \- age and time zone(doesn't matter as long as you can make the above time) \- briefly describe your experience with ttrpgs. it’s ok if you don’t have any \- do you have any fears and or frustrations from ttrpgs (things that have caused bad experiences)? \-what class you want to play \-what land you wish to originate from \-what race you want to play \-what's your favorite meme? (send me a link!) \-what weapon do you want to be bonded with you for life? so far in my time as a dm i've had people request anime weapons, video game weapons, and custom mades. if it is within my power of balancing i will make it happen! \- what type of player are you, or what playstyle do you enjoy? ex: minmaxer, rolplayer, explorer, combat tactician. \- what do you like most about dnd? \- what do you dislike the most about dnd? \- what do you want from this campaign/group? \-roll 1d100 and 1d1000 for me and give me those numbers for some starting gear for you \- any questions for me or things you want me to know?",lfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/16dnc3r/hello_hello_looking_for_12_players_for_an_ongoing/,0

16dmb1o,denim on the diamond - refunds?,"first off, as someone that was evacuated due to the wildfires i understand that it was a fluid, scary situation. dotd decided to postpone the concert to thanksgiving long weekend, they have also switched tickets for individual day holders (original saturday ticket is not a friday ticket etc.). given that the dates have materially changed to a date that a lot of people will not be able to attend for various reasons (most common is family thanksgiving) i was wondering if anyone has had any luck with deadline with thick’s as thieves entertainment. they have suggested we donate the tickets or sell on marketplace. for many that were directly impacted by the fires, or have given elsewhere this does not make sense financially. for selling on marketplace , this has not been successful for most as dotd as reopened ticket sales as a direct competitor. they have also “updated” their policy on their site to state that refunds will not be provided should the event be postponed. this was not there before the wildfires. has anyone had any success with getting their tickets refunded? tldr: denim on the diamond / thick as thieves postponed their festival due to wildfires to thanksgiving long weekend when many cannot attend and has not offered refunds.",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/16dmb1o/denim_on_the_diamond_refunds/,0

16f7cdp,my boyfriend gives me anxiety,"idk why but i’ve been feeling kind of triggered by my new relationship. he’s really kind and gives me a lot of attention but i seem to be questioning how compatible we are at times which i have spoken with him about and he disagreed. i think maybe it’s all in my head and has more to do with me and my mental health though. here are some things i seem to be struggling with. we went to high school together, he was a senior when i was a freshman so we didn’t really know eachother. this was more than ten years ago, we’re in our 30s now. i know he was really popular and honestly idk what i was considered. i was a cheerleader and overall accepted by everyone i would say but wasn’t prom queen or anything. i showed him a throwback picture of me and the cheer team last night at a sleepover and he pointed out some popular girls like “oh i know these people” all jolly and i’m like um obviously we all went to school together and grew up in the same small town then he said “you probably hated that, going to the cheerleader sleepovers, you’re a shy girl” and idk why but i took that very offensively. like as if i’m some weirdo and after being on a team with these girls for years i wouldn’t have formed some sort of bond with them like i’d be in a corner. i told him i found it offensive and he told me to stop reading into things so much. which brings me to my next point of i feel like he is very outgoing and likes to be social and i tend to be more introverted yet i can be extroverted when i need to be but maybe get some social anxiety in certain situations. i’ve been a bartender for ten years and feel so over having to talk to people and deal with them. when i’m not working it’s like my whole social battery is depleted. i feel like him and i will end up in situations where he’ll randomly start talking to the people next to us trying to be social and i’m going to be so annoyed like why can’t we just enjoy or time together just you and me. he also has seemed to have a really easy life where as i feel like my life has been hard. this makes me kind of resent him and makes it hard to relate to him. we tend to view a lot of things differently i feel because i’m coming from a place of trauma and he’s coming from this happy go lucky view on life. i don’t think he’ll ever really be able to understand the hardships i’ve been through or the struggle of mental health and addiction. which brings me to the fact that i’m sober and he’s not. he drinks beer or smokes weed sometimes which should be no biggie but there has already been a time when it was just me and him together and he decided to have some drinks and it’s like i don’t understand why in that situation he would drink. i said something to him of course and he stopped drinking once i said what i had to say but i don’t understand the lack of consideration for your sober girlfriend in that instance. lastly apparently another good girlfriend of mine said she was interested in him also and i can’t help feeling insecure about the fact that they probably would’ve been a better match. she likes all the same things as him, golf, football, video games. only thing is she slept with his good friend once so him knowing that eliminates her as an option for him. i still worry as time goes and they end up around each other through social events he’ll realized that maybe he likes her more. i’m also worried that my friend is maybe secretly carrying a little resentment towards me because he chose me. i know this was a big long rant, just wondering if anyone has any advice or understands how i’m feeling.",dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/16f7cdp/my_boyfriend_gives_me_anxiety/,0

16f77pc,europonies vs la ponies,"it seems the invasive parasites known as sparkeponies have diversified and concentrated into two major species: europonies and la ponies. europonies have non-surprisingly adopted burner fashions that were popular among their american counterparts 10 years - bedazzled captain hats and shitty led furcoats galore. europonies instantly forget any english whatsoever ever when asked to do anything, but suddenly speak perfect english when asked about dj sets and ketamine. europonies are often found in large troops with other europonies exploring to the 2 and 10 sectors. europonies can often be found in rvs, which apparently don’t exist in europe, and can be easily spotted doing insane illogical shit to their rvs - like taping every crevice including their doors. europonies also love smoking cigarettes and can be identified scent of bad cigarettes and left over boofing materials. europonies are mostly here to treat burning man like a long week in ibiza. they can easily be avoided by staying away from lss camps and the dmz. while europonies are annoying, we thank them for their sizable contribution to the reno economy. la ponies are like europonies except without any redeeming qualities. as most people are aware, when northern california is done with something culturally- it’s sent down to southern california to die a miserable exploited death. if people from norcal created burning man, people from la are here to destroy it. unlike europonies that choose 1 of 3 outfits, la ponies all look the same - kim kardashian kanye west era black clothing or spiritual mojo dojo casa house kens. la ponies do their best to recreate la parties at burning man because that’s their only point of reference. la ponies can often be heard complaining about any kind of inconvenience (la people stay inside their track homes all day — only to leave for auditions) especially once when they have run out of ketamine and/or stuck in their rv due to weather conditions. la ponies are exclusively narcissistic wierdos that take pictures of themselves non-stop, or get simp hangerons to take pictures of them. like europonies they are also exclusively found at lss @ 2,10 and dmz. to get rid of these annoying pests, make sure to blast mac dre as loud you can in their direction- or remind them of auditions they’re missing.",BurningMan,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/16f77pc/europonies_vs_la_ponies/,0

16f77iu,i took 1g of golden teacher and it was awful,"i really would apprechiate if you could give me some feedback on what supposed to be my first psychedelic experience but left me back just frustrated. a few years back i (39m) decided that i wanted to take psychedelics at one point in my life but never realy felt ""ready"". in my early 20s i was in therapy for depression and managed to work my way out with the help of ssris and a good therapist. but since then it always felt that i was only 50% back to normal. also i was raised very religious but lost my faith in this depression phase. i made peace with my past and it´s something that doesnt affect me anymore. however, the lesson i learned from this is that i stopped seeing the world in black and white since someone in chruch said this is good and that is evil. i reevaluated all my standpoints/opinions, opened myself to people around me and i am more comfortable to where and who i am than ever. i am in a relationship for more than ten years and i still enjoy being with her. the stability in my relationship and my job gave me the foundation to get deeper into myself since i felt more and more disconnected with myself lately. in general i dont have a lot of experience with drugs, i started smoking weed maybe 8 years ago and it reactivated my creativity but this effect faded over the time. my friend introduced me to mdma last year and i took it a couple of times since then. it is a nice, peaceful rush but since i feel a bit off the following two days i dont have the need to do this frequently. last year i got a growkit and i managed to get 20g of dried shrooms out of this kit. since then they were sitting in a dark spot and me waiting for the right time to get on the journey. but i didn´t want to rush and waited - until yesterday. me and my gf went outside, it was a warm summerday and we lay down in the shadows of an appletree. she was my tripsitter and i took 1 gram of mushrooms and was on no other substances or medication. half an hour in the visuals started and also my ears started ringing - which is always asign of stress for me. slowly my thoughts faded and my head went empty. instead of getting into a state of higher contiousness it actually felt like a lower state. i layed there for two hours but only felt numb, even when trying to get into reflection it was not possible for me to focus on a single thought. we then went back home and on the way everywhere i looked and what i saw felt meaningless and annoying. back inside i felt the need to lay down on the bed in the dark room. this is where negativity slowly took over because no matter how hard i tried, it was not possible escape that emptyness in my head. towards the end of the trip it felt really disgusting and i had a hard time keeping my shit together and not loosing my mind. i really could see how a psychedelic trip can end in a psychosis. 5-6 hours after consumption most of the trip was over, leaving me in a state i only remember from my depression. empty and exhausted. writing this the trip is over for 24h and there is not a single positive aspect i took from that. i´m happy for everyone having better experience but for me it was underwhelming and partly terrifing. has someone of you made a similar experience? does lsd work better for you? will a higher dose lead to a better trip? i dont want to repeat a trip like this, if i ever take shrooms again then it will only be with a trip killer. thanks for every response!",Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/16f77iu/i_took_1g_of_golden_teacher_and_it_was_awful/,0

during family and friend problems. i̇n our 6th month,randomly in one morning,he texted me and said something about his feelings to me changed,that he wanted to break up and that he felt empty about me anymore. first,i was obviously suprised since he had shown no signs about falling out of love prior.even the day prior,we had been just fine and same. and of course,i was hurt.i expressed my shock and sadness and even tried to explain to him that he was rushing this break up and that he might be making a wrong decision.but he just said he was sure about this and that he had fallen out of love. i was devastated but i let him go. i̇n the very next day,he texted me and said that he he had made a huge mistake.he said he didnt understand that what had gotten into him and that he had made huge mistake.he was asking to meet up and fix things.i̇t felt off but i agreed.when we met up,he was bombarding me with all the sorrys and i love yous.he explained that he was in a terrible stress due to

hated to see him cry like that,my heart broke. i just took his word about the college acceptence exam stress and thought that he just managed the stress wrong,i took him back and eventually left the whole thing behind. another 4 months passed.everything was fine and our relationship had been progressing even more.he had even met my parents and friends and i was also hanging out with his friends. until the night of the college acceptance exam. he had made a pretty good job.i mean the results werent out yet but from the answer key,it was obvious that he had won. i,on the other hand,from all the stress, had messed up,so i thought,.that meant i had to try again next year.i did not know i,in fact,won until like a 1 month later when i mentioned him that i thought i failed,he switched his attiude and told me that this meant he had won and i hadnt and said that when he will be off to college,he didnt want to deal with me,that he was gonna move to another city and that did not want a long

back to age 14,what would we change. i did not feel suspicious and just told him that i liked that times,so i would change nothing.he just looked at me and smiled. another 1 month passed and my ex boyfriend reached out to me,saying he changed,his look on world changed and this break up just made him realize he was wrong all along. listen,i was in a different place and mentally was not healthy

16f73a5,do you think i'm trans?,"am i trans or is it just tocd? i know you have been reading posts like this a thousand times, but i have seen some really good advises here, so i decided to ask you guys. so i'm a 30 year old gay man, despite the fact that i'm mostly bottom and quite submassive, i'm a masculine guy, most of the people don't see that i'm a gay man at first. i really like the way i look, i think i'm quite handsome. i have been diagnosed with ocd in the past, so you could tell, that's the answer to my question is very simple, but for me it's not. maybe it's easier if i write two lists with my thoughts about being trans or not. the questioning came about 13 months ago. the things that make me thinks i'm trans: \- when i was a kid, i used to play that i'm a girl, have long hair and so on. wanted to have barbies and so on. (i played a lot of boyish thing as well, playing football, making action movies with friends where we were soldiers and i saved my girlfriend from bad guys.) \- i remember one or two times i had the thought that it would be really cool to be a girl. \- as a kid i wondered a few times about how cool it would to be a sexy singer and fuck all the guys see me. (i think it's important to note that even from a really young age, these girlish thoughts came with some sexual content, i know it's weird but i was very interested in sexual things quite early, about 7-8-9, don't know exactly.) \- from 12 to 20 these thoughts disappeared, then when i started to smoke weed, i had obsessive thoughts about that if i'm really gay, how is it possible that i'm not so feminime. gay people i saw in the media are always feminime, but i wasn't. i was very happy the way i was and confident about myself, but that time i had this idea first that what if i'm not gay, i'm trans. that time i have the thought that if i could choose, maybe i would choose to be a girl (i have to note that at that time i couldn't imagine that i will come out as gay and have a relationship with a guy, i was 100% sure that it is not possible for me. however, i have a great relationship with a man now, and i love him). the things that make me think i'm not trans: \- i always loved how i look, and not just the way i look, i loved who i am. i was very confident about my personality and who i was. \- never have any social dysphoria, i was very popular in school, have a lot of friends, i was the leader of the band, if you know what i mean. \- was never interested trans porn, always watching gay porn. \- i love my beard, i'm quite hairy and i love the way it is, on my arm, genitals, chests, and so on. - absolutely not interested to have women genitals, can't even imagine that. \- was never interested in cross-dressing, at about 15, i tried on a high-heels shoes, but it did not gave me anything, really. and that was it for me. (however, when these obsessive thoughts started i had periods where i was really anxious, and that time i was interested in women clothes, but it was strange, because sometimes i saw an old lady with a ""grandma"" style clothe and i was like, do you like it? oh yee, you like it, and i was like, what the fuck??) \- back than, when i was wondering about the first time that maybe i'm trans, but checked online and saw that trans people hate their bodies (now i know it's not for everyone, i think that was the trigger 13 months ago), i was like, oh, that's totally not me, and i happily forgot this trans question for 10 years. \- my main issue here is not about the fact that i want to be a girl so badly that it's always on my mind, my issue here is that i can't get a 100% answer wheter i'm trans or not, and it's really disturbing to imagine that my whole life was a lie, that i'm not the man i thought and love to. \- when i have the conlusion that i'm cis, i'm really happy with it, until an unwanted thought come in. \- if there would be a blood test or something which would say, it'a 100% that i'm not trans, i think i would be extremely happy and would not deal with the trans question anymore, even not think about it. \- i started to chat guys at the age of 13, but as a girl, as i did not know about gay chat rooms. but once i found one, i was like, it's much more exciting to be a male (as i'm a male) in these conversations. one more note, maybe it could be important. it's not entirely repulsive the idea to be a girl for me, but if we talk about it on a permanent basis, it's a no from my side, as i feel i don't want to lose who i am. but yeah, it's somehow exciting how would it be to be a girl, but i think for me it's about sex. i don't want to sex as a women, but i envy the fact that women got the sexual attention from men, which is harder for us gay guys. i started to date males a bit late, and i think i missed the temptation thing a bit. if you were able to read it to this point, you are a hero :) thanks for sharing your thoughts.",asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/16f73a5/do_you_think_im_trans/,0

16f6hj1,did anyone used to abuse their meds but was able to turn it around? is there any hope for me?,"nsfw i guess? if it’s too long the last two paragraphs are the questions if you feel like responding. late 20s and started medication year and a half ago. some background info is that i recreationally used drugs back in college. never went overboard or tried the “scary ones”, i just had taken adderall before and knew how it felt. this was something i had in the back of my mind when i was given the choice to finally try being medicated. i don’t smoke weed or take anything anymore, and i don’t even really drink anymore fwiw so it makes me mad at myself for what i’ve been doing. tried concerta first because i thought maybe i should avoid amphetamines, but it made me nauseous, vyvanse was next and i metabolized that really fast (according to my doc) and it wore off around lunch and then i was a zombie for the rest of the day, tried adding a 10 mg adderall booster but tbh didn’t really get anything out of it and it gave me heartburn lol. i got on 25mg of mydayis ehhhh back in april and thought i had found *the one*. that mother really does last *all day* to the extent that the first few days i tried i was inadvertently up until like 4 am, but it worked! i could eat normally on it, unlike vyvanse which made me so not hungry i lost about 15 lbs in the 3 months i was on it, it did not make me depressed in the evenings, it even kind of lingered on in the mornings so i could wake up and go work out like i enjoy doing. i think what fucked me up first was 2 things that happened at once. i don’t like taking pills, i’ve never been good at it. one day the pill got stuck in my throat and i cried and coughed it back up and almost barfed, so i dumped out the beads in my mouth and just knocked it back with some juice. not a medical professional person at all but from my experience as a younger person who did mdma at raves, i would always opt to do the same method because i felt it hit faster and didn’t have to swallow a gross plasticy pill capsule. feel like i kind of triggered a core memory by doing that and then that day i took another one the same way and then fucked it up by thinking “well that was really fun” and took two every day for the last week of that month. whoops! this has now happened 3 months in a row, which obviously i am extremely not proud of plus running out of my medicine 7-10 early sucks ass. i recognize that i want to stop this and instead of wallowing this month like i did the last two, i’m feeling like i need to find a new way of thinking about this. i know that taking more than one does not help me, it really makes me less productive if anything and really just makes me feel geeked out, and i know that taking one *does* help me a lot. i remember where i put things, i don’t need to set reminders to do everything at work, doing chores after work doesn’t feel exhausting and i can go to bed feeling accomplished and proud of what i did that day. it’s so fucking annoying because i *know this* and i still choose to ruin it. i need to get the idea that “my medicine can be used for fun” out of my head. if i can’t then i’ll just have to stop getting it because i know i’m not letting myself go down a rocky road like potential addiction. idk i see occasionally people asking for help but i’d love to see if anyone has been able to get over this mental hurdle and come out the other side. i know there’s lockboxes and timers and giving your medicine to someone trusted, but am i crazy for thinking those are just bandaids on the issue? i want to get a grip on my impulses and be able to trust myself. cheers if you read all this!",adhdwomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/16f6hj1/did_anyone_used_to_abuse_their_meds_but_was_able/,0

16f6b27,tips on not coughing,"coughing, when unnecessary (there's nothing to cough up), is generally bad. it creates undue stress on your whole respiratory tract and can lead to some health problems if done consistently and powerfully. here's a few tips on avoiding coughing oriented towards ripping a rig or bong. the easiest thing you can do is drink room-temperature or warm water before you rip. staying well hydrated keeps your mucus thin and able to protect your throat and lungs. using warm water (not boiling! hot steam is bad!) is also preferable, and i find cold or ice water countereffective. warm water will relax your throat muscles and allow you to open your throat, and hydrates your tissue faster by virtue of being closer to your body temperature (your body doesn't have to work to heat up the water). carbonated beverages are to be avoided, as the acid is rough on your throat. be intentional with your hits. take deep breaths before, get rid of all the air, take your hit and exhale it all. then take a deep breath in through your nose and out your mouth to clear your airway. you do not need to hold your hits. the proper way to inhale and exhale takes some practice, though. you want to have your throat as open as possible and breathe from the diaphragm. if you're a vocalist, you likely already have some experience with both of these. to open your throat, you want to lift your soft palate as if the dentist is making you say ""aaaah"". it's similar to the mouth shape you have when going ""hooh hooh hooh"" to clean your glasses; you should feel the difference in the back of your mouth. you should hear practically no sound when you exhale. and definitely don't talk with smoke in your lungs. to breathe from the diaphragm, commonly known as ""belly breathing"" (as opposed to chest breathing), is made easier by standing or (if not possible) sitting with your back straight. when you breathe in, try pushing your belly out and imagine you're pulling your stomach down. in the worst case scenario, if you do get into a coughing fit, pausing or shallowing your breathing can help you regain control. don't hold your breath for too long, though, as remember you just took a big hit of smoke-not-oxygen. hopefully you can put a few of these into action and keep your respiratory tract healthy and seshes comfortable.",trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/16f6b27/tips_on_not_coughing/,0

16f6ah4,struggling with not drinking after divorcing an alcoholic feels like a cruel joke from the universe.," tw: suicide this is lengthy, but i need to get this off my chest. daily drinking began years ago for me back when i thought my now ex-husbands drinking was manageable. i was stressed, red wine is delicious, and we were both in denial. however i always kept myself in check (see: functioning alcoholic) while he slid down the slippery slope of alcoholism. covid sent it into overdrive when he transitioned to wfh and then never transitioned back to the office. he was suddenly alone all day at our house (with a high paying government job), and i found myself weighing vodka bottles as i made my breakfast each morning just to keep track of how much he was drinking. i tried confronting him, but he thought because he brought home a hefty paycheck and exercised a few days a week that he did not have a problem. i’ll spare you the gory details, but other substances got involved and he spiraled into complete psychosis in march of 2022. he left one night in a fit of rage that was fabricated in own mind. was missing, found & arrested, then admitted into a behavioral health facility, and later released to his mother after telling me i needed to divorce him because the cia was recruiting him - he needed to be unattached for his new cia family. there was some adultery in there on his end too that came out during all of this, but that hardly seemed to matter during our search efforts. i initiated the divorce, but told him and his mother i wanted to be there for the recovery efforts and that i still loved him endlessly - even if that love looked different. he got into therapy and disconnected from me (which was fine, whatever he needed to do was okay with me). his mother assured me every few weeks that he was doing well, and i started to move on with my life. i started dating someone, i bought a little condo, loved my job. it was freeing - except for that i kept up with the drinking. no one faulted me for it. in fact my mother told me not to worry about it because i “had a reason” to drink. i was driving to my mothers house - to drink wine with her - on january 8th, 2023 when his mom called me. she never called me. i knew before i answered that it couldn’t be good. it wasn’t. he’d spent the weekend with his family and after everyone left walked out into the driveway and used a pistol he found in his stepdads truck to end his life. i was devastated. i am still devastated. it was the next day when his mom admitted to me she had not kept up with him going to therapy, was letting him sit in his dimly lit bedroom for hours on end and drink a case of beer each day. the only time he was leaving the house was to get his daily case of beer and pack of cigarettes. i was floored. she said she thought he was fine because he’d come out of the front porch to smoke and laugh and smile. they stopped hiding the guns and life went on. i try really hard not to fault her, but i wish i had known that he wasn’t getting any help. in the same breath i know it wasn’t my burden to bear anymore (and should’ve never been). anyways. i got so drunk that night that i smoked a whole pack of cigarettes that i don’t even remember buying (i had quit smoking long ago). the next morning i poured a glass of bourbon at 10 am. still had my mother in my ear telling me i shouldn’t worry about the drinking. so worry i did not. i stopped the early morning drinking, but every evening when i got home from work i poured a glass of something. life naturally spiraled out of control for me. i felt like i was drowning in grief - and wine. my job got very stressful, my relationship was getting really complicated, and i found myself being unable to keep up with the daily tasks of life that come with living alone with two dogs (thank god i don’t have children). i was deteriorating and was becoming someone i didn’t recognize. my emotions would crash into when i was least expecting it, and i found myself feeling lonely for the first time in my life. and full of regret. i bared my soul to my mother, who agreed i needed an immediate change. i quit my job, broke up with my boyfriend and sold my condo. i moved in with her, got a part time job and have spent the summer traveling. but one thing remained - drinking. and as you can guess moving in with my mom only made it worse. we were constantly knocking back two bottles of wine a night. occasionally opening a third. i knew i had to change. i just spent two weeks in europe and told my mom that upon my return i would be taking a break from alcohol. she said she understood and that she wouldn’t ask me if i wanted any. i have followed this subreddit for years, but this is the first time i’ve been brave enough to put this out there in some way. so here i am, reading through your posts, wondering what the next day of sobriety will bring. it’s been 4 days and a couple hours since my last drink at the frankfurt airport in germany, and i will not drink with you today.

16f632w,who i could have been without bullying,"i got bullied ever since i can remember. my mom is a narcissist and ever since i can remember she allowed her friends kids to walk all over me expecting me to take it and not complain. i could handle it, i was young and besides these instances i had many other friends. however it all changed when i changed from elementary to middle school. my mom who at the time was a student not earning a lot of money had gotten a scholarship for my elementary school time that allowed me to visit a privat church run elementary school. it was one of these very extremist christian schools, to the point were we weren't allowed to talk about dinos or evolution, we were not allowed to acknowledge halloween and we had to glue pages of our school books showing pictures of witches/ talking animals/ monsters and other witchcraft. this school was great in the sense of absolutely sheltering me from the real world. i spend my years there thinking everyone was my friend and the world was a happy kind place. until my elementary school time and with it my scholarship, ended. my mom decided to send me to her old middle school. said middle school was located in a social burning point, to call it that is even an understatement. i went into it beliving that if i was going to be nice to people, people would be nice to me. they weren't. i must have been such a weird kid to them. i was childish in comparison to the other peers in my class. they were cursing and dating and started smoking by the time they turned 12/13 what later turned into drugs... while i wanted to play catch. i was pretty quickly the bottom of the barrel. not just in my class no of the entire grade. 210 kids against me, the weirdo. i don't remember a lot of the time, luckily? i checked out at some point. i only remember some very vivid things. a guy offering me to steal his grandfather's sleeping pills as long as i promised i'd kill myself with them. being called a whore publicly on facebook, because i had worn a skirt during winter time ( with thick tights underneath) all the comments about the way i looked and my body. being shoved, hit, threatened, locked into places and kicked. older guys trying to take advantage of me. the list goes on. sometimes when i think back to this little girl that just wanted everyone to be happy and to make friends, i cry. i feel so incredibly sorry for her. now the bullying stopped once i changed to high school. but the recovery is still going on almost 10 years later. so far i've spend almost an entire year of my adult life in mental wards getting treated for sever depression, anxiety and social phobia. i fear social interactions and i lack self worth. my lacking self worth especially has endangered me a bunch of times in my adult life. i've become the victim of abusive relationships due to beliving i wasn't worth more than that. to this day i cannot look in the mirror without hearing their voices. i don't like myself. i need a variety of medication just to function.... somewhat function. i prefer being by myself, i only have 1 friend. social interaction drains me to the point i almost completely avoid it. the question of who i might have been if i didn't have to struggle through live for so long is almost unbearable. i think i would have been an absolute social butterfly. maybe i would have managed to find a passion and make a living out of it? i was very creative and loved to draw before i lost interest in almost everything. maybe i would have advanced my drawing skills and actually gone to art school like i've always dreamed? maybe i would actually have a few things i'd like about myself? i will never know. but that's ok. i've accepted myself for who i am now. thinking about a what if? won't change my past. it's ok",bullying,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/16f632w/who_i_could_have_been_without_bullying/,0

16f5xks,rock n roll hall of fame website’s bio on musical excellence inductee chaka khan,"funk queen, rock goddess, jazz singer, disco diva – chaka khan embodies and transcends these. with a voice of seductive fire and sweet smoke, khan came to prominence with the innovative funk/rock group rufus in the 1970s. equally ferocious and feminine, she was rufus’ secret weapon. at a time when audiences for rock and soul were splitting into different camps, khan’s voice and presence represented the racial and social integration at the heart of rock & roll. with her incredible vocal range and mastery of dynamics, chaka khan has recorded long-lasting, powerful music for close to five decades. after rufus’ long run of hits, khan broke out on her own in 1978 with ashford & simpson’s “i’m every woman,” a successful mix of rock and disco. throughout her career, khan mastered the rhythms of every era, from funk to rock to hip-hop; she also showcased her jazz roots on albums like echoes of an era (1982) and classikhan (2004). her landmark solo album, 1984’s i feel for you, featured the creative and exciting mix of funk, synth dance rhythms, and hip-hop of the prince-penned title track and the stunning ballad “through the fire.” khan continues to be one of the most prolific and eclectic singers around, covering songbook standards and soul classics to equal acclaim, and earning the 2008 grammy for best r&b album with funk this, her tenth grammy win. khan’s most recent album, hello happiness, was released in 2019. inspired by pioneering female artists like aretha franklin and joni mitchell, chaka khan remains one of the mightiest and most influential voices in music. it is impossible to imagine today’s streetwise but sensual hip-hop-soul divas without khan’s influence paving the way for other formidable women like mary j. blige, erykah badu, and janelle monáe, as well as versatile, powerhouse vocalists like sam smith. khan’s work has endured for decades and continues to inspire fellow artists and fans alike.",rockhall,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockhall/comments/16f5xks/rock_n_roll_hall_of_fame_websites_bio_on_musical/,0
16f5x6y,stranded tanker mission review - part 1,"hello agents. this is the follow up to my previous post, where i tried to take a deeper look at the story telling in the jefferson trade center mission. ([link]( LINK for the next mission to look at, i chose one of my personal favourites, stranded tanker. **intro** stranded tanker is the final mission in the manhunt for one of keener’s lieutenants, vivian conley. we’ve just missed her at the jtf respite shelter but an echo we discover there tells us that the cleaners are using a stranded tanker as a base, and this is where conley has gone. **kelso:** thanks to the intel you found at the shelter, we know that conley operates from the stranded oil tanker, next to the manhattan bridge. the cleaners have been refining oil there for some time now, presumably under conley’s supervision. **benitez:** additional intel suggests a weak spot in their perimeter around the complex by a gate to the west. **rhodes:** sounds like you’re now equipped to go kick her ass, agent. until we complete the mission, we cannot fast travel to it, so most agents will make their way there from the chinese supermarket, the nearby safe house in the two bridges district. if you pay careful attention as you walk toward the site, you might notice several removal trucks. there are other removal trucks around new york, but this seems to be the area with the most, possibly a nod to the cleaner’s using the manhattan storage company as part of their base. for most of us, this will be the first time we have seen the stranded tanker, and the introduction to it is subtle to the point where we may well miss it. this is the entrance to the mission: &#x200b; LINK as always with the division 2, the game world very closely resembles the real world. if you look on google street view for this location there is indeed a self storage company at this exact location – though obviously the name has been changed to avoid legal issues. while you are on street view, spin the camera around to the left and note the deli & grocery across the street with the large yellow sign – then go back to the game and see the ”tuang brothers general store” with the same size and shape large yellow sign. keep panning around and see the tall brown apartment building – same in the game as it is in real life… but let’s take another look at the above image. there’s a lot going on here, what with the puddles of oil, the barrels, the clusters of dark coloured metal pipework, and a plume of filthy, dirty, black smoke rising from behind the building. there’s obviously clear evidence of some sort of heavy industry taking place here. but what’s that in the background, on the left? there’s the stranded tanker. i really appreciate the way that it is there, but most of us probably miss it the first time around, because there’s just so much going on and it’s cleverly positioned between the bridge in the background and the compound in the foreground **breaching the compound** as soon as we move in to attack, we get some more comms. **kelso:** time to take down vivian conley and hopefully get us one step closer to finding that sonofabitch keener. we know that patrols of cleaners regularly head out through the west gate of their oil refinery. let’s exploit that opportunity to infiltrate their complex. **rhodes:** a lot of peacekeepers are dead because keener’s been using conley. find her and make it count. **lau:** good luck agent. entering the compound, we pass under a pair of shower heads, with a yellow tray under them. it looks like a makeshift shower unit for cleaners to wash off the worst of the oil and dirt. then we get to a second, more comprehensive set of shower heads and a bank of purple lights, probably ultra violet ones. this is a decontamination shower to wash off any trace of the green poison and then kill it with uv light – a nod to the cleaner’s obsession with eradicating the virus and taking care to try and neutralize any contamination. actually, you will find these measures on all the other entrances in this compound – a really nice touch that fits the world. the entrance to the compound, looking back towards the way out: &#x200b; LINK the level designers have made a change to the real world storage building here, probably for game design reasons. instead of immediately stepping into the building, we have an open courtyard area directly in front of the building’s entrance, with 3 large metal shutters closing off the bays for loading and unloading. above the shutters is a walkway which is inaccessible to us, but where you will often find a cleaner, giving us threats on two levels. the courtyard itself has been built by the cleaners, using presumably broken-down garbage trucks, storage containers, some metal frames and rolls of barbed wire. there are a couple of details i’d like to point out in this area: &#x200b; LINK the first is the yellow, rolling tool-box with the “black flame power tools” sticker (and others) on it. this is actually a fairly common asset, we see it in many locations, but it still looks the part and feels authentic. i can easily imagine power tool suppliers giving out stickers with their products and owners decorating their tool boxes with them. black flame is too common a phrase to find a possible real-life influence, but the box on top of it is labelled wse\_315. i suspect this is based on the real life andeli wse-315 arc welder. off to the right, we can see a removal truck which has been used as part of the barricade. it belongs to the “irish lck bros” – almost certainly a reference to irish luck, or the luck of the irish. interestingly, but almost certainly just completely coincidentally, one of the meanings of the name “conley” in irish is “chaste fire.” apt for a cleaner boss. finally, in this area we see many instances of a new symbol, which appears to be the rod of asclepius – a staff with a serpent coiled around it (not to be confused with the rod of caduceus). the rod of asclepius is a symbol with close associations to medicine. this is a montage of these symbols found in various locations in the game. some feature crosses with numbers and letters above them: &#x200b; LINK they appear heavily in cleaner related missions, including this one and pathway park, and is definitely in wall street at least once (the one that says “kill dem”, but not cleaner control points. it’s also behind conley in the stranded tanker’s bridge (bottom right image), which makes me think it must be important or significant but despite my best efforts i’ve not been able to make any progress with understanding where it comes from and why it suddenly appears in td2, and so heavily too. i reran the joe ferro mission in td1 and didn’t see it there. the cleaner logo is like the recycling logo – nothing like this. i wonder if it’s a new symbol that conley has taken up for the cleaners now that she runs them, or perhaps a local signal for the lower manhattan cleaners? if anyone knows, please let me know. opening the shutters we move into the storage company loading bay, with the raised floor for people to unload directly from the back of vans and trucks. here the designers present us with the challenge of cleaners bursting out of the left hand door, behind the counter, then reinforcements coming from the right side too. after we dispatch these, we can proceed through the back left door but before we do that, we get some comms: **conley:** division has infiltrated our complex. could be a contamination risk. we can’t let anything disrupt our operation. oil is the fuel of our organization and our cause. **paul rhodes:** sounds like conley’s really invested in this oil business. **agent kelso:** i guess you now know which buttons to press. agent, let’s wreck their compound. we’ll talk about conley’s integration into the cleaners later, but i just love kelso’s take on the matter, which is so on-point for her character, i.e. blow stuff up. remember back at the grand washington hotel when she finds an ammo dump? her first reaction is to blow it up. people often talk about kelso’s personality, saying she is reckless, and i’m not sure what i think about that at the moment, it’s something i’ll need to consider. but either way, i just love her simplistic, sledgehammer approach to the problem. we enter a small corridor that seems to double as a kit room, with coat hooks covered in cleaner uniforms and thick puddles of oil all over the floor – what awaits us behind the next door is obviously going to be messy, and that’s before we wreck it… but before we do that, one more quick detail. see this sign on the wall: &#x200b; LINK the headers are complete, but the text in the body is, literally, lorem ipsum (it even says it in the 2nd paragraph, 4th line and elsewhere). in publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. it is used to focus attention on graphic elements or may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. i find it amusing they even reference it in the text – a nice touch. **into the breach - the drill\\tunnel room** as soon as we open the door, we see a container suspended from a crane. the container’s doors are open and we see it is full of barrels, then it quickly turns away and descends into a large hole in the middle of the room. &#x200b; LINK as we enter the room, we alert the cleaners. it’s a large, multi-level area, clustered with cover and cleaner controllers (drone operators) love to sit at the back on the top right walkway and pilot their bombardier drones towards us, backed up by engineers with napalm turrets, all whilst we try and deal with cleaner rushers and assaulters. conley’s voice comes over the tannoy system. **conley:** reinforcements are coming. protect our assets. the container full of barrels comes back up, only now the barrels are gone and two more assault cleaners come out. **kelso:** looks like the reinforcements are coming from the cleaners’ underground tunnel system. it’s a complicated fight, with lots of threats to deal with at the same time and keeps us on our toes. once all the hostiles are dealt with, we can investigate the room but before we do that, we get some instruction from kelso: **kelso:** find a way to block off access to the tunnels, or the place will be swarming with cleaners in no time. it’ll also keep conley from using the tunnel as an escape route. just as aside, i note here that kelso pronounces the word “route” the way we do in the uk, to rhyme with the word “root”, rather than the typical american pronunciation which would rhyme with the word “rout”. doesn’t mean anything, i just noticed it and am mentioning it. the room itself is a large rectangular chamber, with elevated walkways down each side. remember, this is a storage company, so looking down the walls we can actually see the shutters for the various storage units. nice attention to detail from the designers. hanging from the ceiling at the end of the room is something that will be familiar to agents who have already defeated kajika – a full stack of diesel fuel tanks. &#x200b; LINK we see these tanks in nancy, the drilling machine, and this confirms that this room is where the cleaners are sending the oil they are refining down into the tunnels to fuel their drilling machine as it inches towards haven. they are using the container as a lift to take barrels down into the tunnel and sending reinforcements back up. anyway, it’s time to deal with the tunnel, so we press a button to raise the nearby fork lift and drop a load of barrels into the pit, which promptly explode, causing the container lift to fall, crashing into the depths. there’s a powerful, bright light down in the tunnel which makes it hard to see what is happening down there, but i do know that if you detonate an assault cleaner’s fuel tank while he is standing next to the railing, there’s a good chance the explosion will thrown him down into the depths. never gets boring. something else which never gets boring is the voice acting and we get this great little exchange between rhodes and kelso, after we block the tunnel. **rhodes:** i suggest you sabotage whatever parts of the cleaners’ oil production you come across, might piss conley off and get her out of whatever hole she’s hiding in. **kelso:** rhodes, i like the way you think. **rhodes:** you’re growing on me too kelso. i just love this – the voice actors deliver their lines perfectly and it really feels like two very like-minded individuals having a moment of appreciation for each other. as we open the doors, we hear conley again. **conley:** the division’s progressing inside the complex. they’re approaching the sandbanks defend the oil. too many people depend on us to succeed. don’t fail them! we enter another short corridor, with more cleaner kit hanging on the walls and another decontamination module with water or steam vapour and uv lights to kill the virus. the cleaners really are serious about the threat. before we step through the doorway at the end of this short passage, this is probably a good point to talk about one of the best things about this mission – the music. ola strandh’s scores throughout the franchise are amazing, but the music for stranded tanker is one of my absolute favourites. i don’t know how it works, but there’s a dynamic process involved with the music that changes as we proceed throughout the missions, but not in a jarring way – the soundtrack doesn’t just cut and switch. throughout the mission, it cleverly continues with a low level, rhythmic background song that allows the game to play the next phase of the score when you activate certain trigger points (killing the last enemy, opening a door, passing a certain point). and here is such a trigger. as soon as we step out onto the sand, the music kicks in with a rising crescendo of stabbing, urgent beats, that encourage us to push on with urgency. it’s such a great, pulsating pounding, electronic track, i love it. almost immediately above us, filling the sky, is the fdr drive. below it, and all around us, is evidence of the devastating surge flood that swamped manhattan during the hurricane. directly to our left and high and dry is a rather nice looking sailboat, there are smashed cars piled up and a thick layer of sediment and sand covers the floor everywhere, left there when the waters receded. **the sandbanks** before we can proceed a small group of cleaners appear from over the top of a garbage truck and are easily dispatched. there’s a hidden weapon crate off to the right, through a tunnel of trashed cars, which the hurricane and flood waters have tossed around like toys. we kick down a pair of steel plates and walk through into the next area. **kelso:** agent. i’ve deployed a surveillance drone to the area. i’ll let you know if i spot conley. off to the right is a great view of lower manhattan, with the wreck of the brooklyn bridge and the skyscrapers of the financial district behind it. to the left of the bridge is one of two giant container ships, still loaded with containers, which are heavily listing and appear to have partially sunk onto their sides. it gives us a great sense of scale, not just of the city, but of the extent of the devastation the hurricane and flooding have caused. it’s great world building. &#x200b; LINK to our left is a chain link fence we must climb over to continue. as we drop down on the other side of it and start to move forwards, the game takes control of our camera and pans upwards to highlight the big reveal, the pay-off for our progress so far, our first real look at the stranded tanker. &#x200b; LINK and what a sight it is, a huge ship, so massive that it almost obscures the manhattan bridge behind it, yet it’s managed to become driven high up onto the land, breaking its back in the process and tearing into two pieces. a flock of seagulls rises from the sand bank, further adding to the sense of awesome scale. i really like that this mission uses something other than a building, or just general area, as the setting for the mission. i know it makes sense that almost all of our missions take place within the notable buildings of dc, but when you go to those missions you don’t really get a sense of “ok, this is it” – you walk past lots of big buildings until you reach to the one you need to go into and you just walk into it. you don’t generally get the distance from them to be able to appreciate their size and scale, nor do they typically stand out from their surroundings, but here we can literally see this massive tanker in the distance that we will need to assault. it’s really well done and makes this feel special. this is where we are going but to get there we must deal with the cleaners in the foreground fixing a cooling pump. **cleaner:** shit. fucking oil gas. somebody’s gotta fix those cooling pumps. whoever is going to fix the pumps, it’s not these guys. you can wait for a few seconds until the gas cloud is large enough, then let them spot you. amusingly, they will instantly open fire and ignite the gas cloud they are standing in to set themselves on fire. once we take care of the initial group, rhodes gives us some more good advice. **rhodes:** whatever they’re cooling probably cannot handle too much heat. do whatever you can do to disable those pumps, agent. trust me, it’ll be fun. i can see why kelso likes him. after we blow up the first cooling pump, he says. **rhodes:** looks like there are some more cooling pumps. you know what to do. this part of the mission gives us a few new challenges. we can immediately destroy the second fuel pump but then we get attacked by groups of cleaners – rushers pushing us, backed up by drone operators and assault cleaners. we must deal with this multi-threat attack whilst also being careful not to stray into one of the many gas clouds that forms, lest we set ourselves alight. it’s a fun dynamic that adds an extra challenge to the combat – unless you get set on fire in which case it’s annoying and bad game design winking_face the sandbank itself is a scene of ecological devastation, with literally thousands of dead fish and birds, some left high and dry as the flood waters receded while others are covered in oil, there are pools of the stuff everywhere and the water is full of it, creating those weirdly beautiful rainbow reflections. &#x200b; LINK speaking of the oil, someone has erected floating barriers to try and contain the spill and there are hundreds of buckets around the beach – based on the evidence, e.g. the changing rooms full of oil covered clothing and oil stained floors, plus us being inside the cleaners base, i am guessing that the cleaners are sending groups out to the sandbank to collect whatever extra oil they can, in addition to what they can recover from the tanker itself. waste not, want not! after destroying the third pump and taking care of the cleaners kelso jumps back onto comms. **kelso:** let’s see what else you can mess with that’ll piss her off. a closed container which was blocking our progress is helpfully opened by an assault cleaner, allowing us to continue towards the tanker. **rhodes:** see? i told you it’d be fun. conley is less impressed: **conley:** the division’s roaming inside our complex, disrupting our production and endangering our most precious resource. this is joe ferro’s legacy. don’t let the division spoil it! defend the refinery with your life! ==================================================================================== and that’s where, for now, we need to leave it. i really want to get into a regular schedule of putting out one article every sunday and it’s taken me hours to get as far as i have with this one. looking ahead to what happens next in the mission, and knowing how much i waffle on, it will just take me too long to complete it and get it out today. i’m also in danger of exceeding the character count and image limit if try and do it all in one post. i hope people enjoy this, please do comment and let me know what you think. i’m also open to suggestions for other missions to review and if i get suggestions, i’ll try and do the most requested one. currently manning national zoo is on +1 following u/mjbotte1’s request from last week. have a great week agents! &#x200b;",thedivision,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/16f5x6y/stranded_tanker_mission_review_part_1/,0

16f5vvq,the nun 2 - i have so many questions!!! (spoiler warning),"spoiler warning warning wtf, it had massive plot holes. like they explained nothing about st lucie’s eyes. why was the demon looking for this particular relic? i feel like there is a back story there that they either didn’t bother thinking about, or it landed on the cutting rook floor. because you can walk into almost any church in rome and they’ll be dozens of relics hanging around. so why was the demon so obsessed with these eyeballs?! how did they give the demon more power?! it can already toss people around, make shit fly and even set people on fire. it can also shapeshift and be invisible and control other spirits. what other fucking powers does it need? how did the eyes work? they just magically glow and boom collision and also how did sister irene just magically become a marvel avenger? and if relics are supposed to be so holy, why on earth could the demon just randomly use them. and lastly, how the fuck did maurice get possessed by the demon again when it apparently was smoked by sister irene?! sooo many questions. overall, the movie felt like it had potential - it could have had this cool mystery element to it, with irene and debra exploring the string of mysterious murders. and on the other side you could have had the mystery of why the nun was obsessed with the school. like - i think if this would have been a tv series with great directors, it could have been phenomenal.",horror,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/16f5vvq/the_nun_2_i_have_so_many_questions_spoiler_warning/,0
16f5vnr,confusing symptoms,"i took a break for about 3 days and still experienced stomach pains/constipation, but no acid reflux/coughing. my appetite got back to pretty much normal within a few days. before it wasn’t too bad, but it was a little harder to eat sober and i was getting mucus/coughing after eating sometimes. i used to get these type of coughs when anxious, so they feel really familiar. when i got back to smoking i felt pretty normal. it feels like my vision tips a bit, though. my roommate hit the same pen and said he noticed his vision being wavy so it may just be the strain. i woke up with some gas and that globus sensation. to test things out i smoked this morning and the lump feeling got worse during the onset of the high, then mellowed out as i got less anxious, and kinda came back again as i started fixating on it. hot showers don’t do anything but make me more uncomfortable. when waking up i wasn’t dizzy per se, but i felt kinda disassociated and off balance. when i went to go eat, the lump feeling kinda came up again. i’m wondering if the lump is just an anxiety thing and in part me being anxious about smoking and constantly trying to monitor my symptoms. stomach things tend to calm down after smoking, but the lump in throat lasts as long as i’m thinking about it. i’ve also been smoking mostly daily for just 6 months. i never really wake and bake besides on occasion, like today. it doesn’t even feel worth it anymore but i keep falling back into the habit hoping it’ll be what it once was, and i don’t know what’s going on. i went to the doctor and they did some blood tests so i’ll just be waiting on that. my diet has also drastically changed since i’ve moved to college, consisting of mostly dining hall food.",CHSinfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHSinfo/comments/16f5vnr/confusing_symptoms/,0

16f5u1q,god is faithful,"i write this to help and encourage those who are or who were in the same situation i was. i express this with my whole heart that there is hope, that god is real, that his son jesus is alive and he does save. my name is joel. for many years i struggled with drugs, alcohol, porn, and all matter of mental problems and crazy emotions. it all started when i was young. i got introduced to hardcore pornography at the age of 5. from there came everything else. i didn't see the girls and my teachers in my class the same anymore. it opened the doors to all manner of demonic beings and attacks. as i got older i started to be very promiscuous with girlfriends and relationships. i started to hang out with the wrong crowd. i started drinking and smoking weed at the age of 15. by the age of 18 i was snorting cocaine and heroin... then by age 21 came the meth... meth started to destroy my life completely. i would mix meth, porn and women and i i like an animal. it got so bad that in 2012 i went to men's recovery home that was christ centered.i would do good for a season but would mess up time and time again. and every single time i went back to my mess it got worse and worse. i started using needles to inject my drugs. it got to the point we're i was homeless in the woods injecting myself with dirty needles i would find on the ground of the homeless camp. sin had taken me we're i didn't wanted to go, kept me longer than i wanted to stay and made me spend more than i was willing to pay. this can happen to anyone. but god !! even when i turned my back on god he was faithful. when i spit on his face he still loved me, when i relapsed all those times he was still there. god was faithful when i was faithless. today i'm clean, sober, and i still have my children in my life. and i owe it all to god. i've overdosed over 4 times. one of those times my sister found me blue in the face in the bathroom. i should be dead and in hell. but god's grace and mercy has kept me alive long enough to receive my calling. now i can go to the streets, the dope houses, the woods, the bridges, the camps and i can be a light to others as god was a light to me in my darkness and desperation. if you ever need prayer brother or sister i am here for you. i'm here to serve and to love you. there is hope. and that hope is jesus.

16f5s6w,breaking bad is an insane power fantasy and should have ended on granite state,"it initially mirrors american beauty with the whole lobotomite suburban dad who reclaims his vitality through controversial means, but instead of just smoking weed, jacking off to 17 year olds and calling your daughter a bitch. he nearly singlehandedly ousts his state’s biggest drug kingpin, makes the purest meth ever seen by mankind and becomes so successful that there’s a scene where his wife outright states that he no longer has financial incentive to produce meth because he’s made so much money that he could never feasibly run out of it. then ozymandias happens, everything comes crashing down, and just as you think we’re finally going to get emotional payoff and a conclusion to walter’s arc where he suffers the consequences of everything he’s done and will die, sad, alone and in pain, he’s just like, “fuck it nvm” and travels across country while there’s a national manhunt for him, is identified by several people which does not deter him at any point and then goes on an unstoppable killing spree which defeats all of his remaining enemies which also fixes all of the problems his friends and family were suffering as a result of his egomaniacal criminal reign falling and they all get to go live decent lives now. it’s ridiculous and insane and ruins the entire series, which already wasn’t very good. the series could have very much ended on a slightly altered version of the penultimate episode granite state, which sure, would have been a little anti-climactic but at least has some meaning to it? despite being an autistic nerd walter white feels like he was written for the specific purpose of inspiring as many chad memes and sigma edits as possible, what a ridiculous character.",redscarepod,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/16f5s6w/breaking_bad_is_an_insane_power_fantasy_and/,0

16f5lzm,i hate how simplistic and straight forward the songs are nowadays...,"i'm sure this post will be barraged with downvotes, but aside from enemy and a small handful of songs from mercury act 1, i have not enjoyed any of imagine dragons' releases from the past the past few years. i gave a listen to their new song for starfield hoping maybe it would break the mold a little bit, but nope. turned it off halfway through. couldn't stand it. the lyrics are so straightforward. you'd listen to a song on smoke + mirrors or night visions and think ""huh, i wonder what in particular that lyrics means."" i haven't gotten any of that from the recent releases. the content isn't super great. woe is me, fuck the haters, and a few love songs sprinkled in. and a lot of the songs make me physically cringe. sharks for example: ""crisis take advantage off your niceness cut you up in even slices prey on your fears "" niceness?? reallly??? and don't even get me started on bones. it all just feels so watered down. it's clear from the lyrics that this is coming from a person who is dealing with some significant mental health issues and learning to put them behind him. it's a very personal album for sure. but i absolutely cannot get past the fucking song writing. it's objectively shallower and it sucks. so, if you like it then good for you, i'm glad you could connect. but i'll probably stick to night visions through origins. other than follow you, enemy, and dull knives, both acts of mercury are probably permanent removed from my personal rotation. there was room for personal interpretation in a lot of the earlier music, but songs nowadays are so very clearly about specific thing. it doesn't feel like i'm listening to a song or a piece of art, just listening to dan reynolds talk about himself.

16f5l7j,i found a post about me made by my bf and im heartbroken,"my partner and i show each other posts from redit all of the time and we dont follow each other, but i do remember what his user is. in the post he was wondering if he should break up with me. now i understand looking for outside perspectives, but he absolutely belittled me in the post. he talked about how im lazy, sleep all day, i don’t work, and am getting fat. but the truth is, im a full time student in my last year of university, i have 3 part-time jobs, and i have been (give or take) the same weight our entire relationship (i have a scale, fit in the same clothes since we were first together, and i am involved in sports and activities). he claims im a lazy sack in bed, im constantly having panic attacks and im putting too much pressure on him. i mean maybe i need to put more work in the bedroom but i feel as though we constantly flip back and forth so maybe im missing something. i also have bought toys, lingerie, and have suggested some riské things but maybe its not enough, i don’t know. i used to have pretty bad panic attacks back in high school but ever since being in uni, getting diagnosed properly, and medicated, i really only have them a few times a year (and they are usually during stressful periods, transitional times, or when he screams at me). it also really bothers me that he says i push him too much, because iv told him since he first started contemplating careers that i will support anything he chooses, as long as he chooses something. hes always talked about becoming something in the beginning but he has consistently worked for minimum wage and now flips at me when i ask him if hes been thinking about any longterm goals. he doesnt have his licence so i do all of the driving, grocery shopping, drive him to and from work but he considers it clingy when i ask him if he wants to go get groceries together. i do all of the cooking because when i ask him to he either makes noodles or just straight up doesn’t. i also do most of the cleaning because when ever he does clean its done half assed (food still on dishes, will sweep crumbs off the counter and just leave them on the floor). he also is heavily addicted to weed, and i mean i smoke once and a while, but he smokes as soon as his eyes are open and has a bong within arms reach all day, to when he goes to bed at night (even at work and hes not supposed to). iv caught him sexting other people before, he has some pretty bad anger issues and though hes never hit me, iv definitely been scared of him before. i plan all of his bdays, and when it comes to mine he just wings it and gets upset with me when i try to plan it with more structure. for all iv dealt with, im just so fucking heartbroken that he would talk about me in his post like he did. i just love him so much and for him to completely tear me down and make me out to be some lazy slob just makes me feel like a pile of garbage. my family and friends all think i do too much and let him get away with too much. his family even thinks he treats me shitty, i really dont know why im allowing myself to be treated like this. we live together, one if my jobs is at the same place he works, i hang out with his sisters regularly. ever since i seen the post, iv been slowly gathering my things and bringing them to my moms. 6 years of my life iv dedicated to him and i just feel stupid. im only 24 but i feel like ill never have the family i dream of building (i know its dramatic im just so devastated) hes been gone for the past 48 hours and just told me hes hanging at a friends house. im so lost and just want to vent. i just hate how iv comprised myself for so long, i hate all of the effort i put in, i hate how hes doing this. i feel so fucking empty",Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/16f5l7j/i_found_a_post_about_me_made_by_my_bf_and_im/,0

16f5i0j,aita for not believing my friend when she says she was drugged at a party," full disclosure this happened back in december 2022. however , i held off on posting until after we graduated and all went our separate ways, just in case this get any sort of attention. everyone in this story is a female all between the ages of 18-22 (mostly college seniors) and we go to a small college in new england. i (22 f) was living in an off campus house with my 5 really close friends. senior year started off at the best year ever, living with my best friends, partying and drinking most days out of the week, and of course half-assing schoolwork. most of us in the house participated in sports through our university mostly on the club level. so at the end of each semester that means going to parties (which we call formals) to celebrate the team. formals are for the team but everyone can bring 1-a few friends. in december, my house hosted a formal because one of my housemates was the president for this particular club sport. for the sake of the post we’ll call it women’s soccer. since we hosted, we could invite whoever we wanted. hosting this formal was the day that senior year went from the best year ever, to a complete shitstorm. the party started off great. everyone is drinking and having a blast. however, we noticed that one girl we invited (who was not on the team, came as a guest) was significantly drunker. we’ll call her m. side note: my whole house was friends with m because we had a lot of mutual friends that connected us. she also lives in an off campus house and we are all really good friends with her housemates too. all seniors as well. some were closer to other due to the same major, living closer together, etc. we would go to the bars with m and she would always get obliterated. not that there’s anything wrong with that but with her when she gets so drunk, she typically makes really bad choices and says things she regrets later. there’s usually some sort of mess she has to clean up in the morning (literal or figurative). m and her whole house was at the party as well. back to the story, m is extremely drunk and it was still pretty early in the night. she mentioned pre-gaming beforehand too. at the end of the night, everybody was pretty drunk but no one seemed to be on the same level as m. m’s drunkness led to a really horrible, awful incident that still makes me so angry and sad to this day. m unconsensually, shoved her hand down the pants of a sophomore girl (b) who was on this team. both women are bisexual, but regardless of that, b did not give consent for m to do that and was obviously very hurt and traumatized. the safest way to go about this was to calmly separate the two of them and my boyfriend drove m and her housemates home and made sure they were safe. that incident ended the party as no one was in the mood to have fun anymore after watching what m did. we comforted b and told her if she needed anything we love her and support her in whatever way she wants to deal with m. it really sucks seeing someone you call your friend do something so vial to someone else, it changes your whole worldview. in the morning, we wake up to texts from m saying how much fun she had and she doesn’t remember anything that happened. my housemate who was the president of women’s soccer told her what she did. at first, m seemed to be apologetic and felt terrible. m was also crying a lot and super embarrassed about what she did. however, about two hours go by and m texts saying she thinks she was drugged at the party and that’s why she did that…. now mind you we knew every single person at the party because it was invite only and we don’t know anyone who would even be able to get their hands on hard drugs. i understand that it’s college, however we’re just not that kind of campus, we drink and smoke and that’s the extend of it. so for m to say that she was drugged was a bold statement, however this was our friend and i wanted to support her. i didn’t want to believe that she would do this. here’s where everything gets sticky. m says that she went to an urgent care and got tested. m says that she came back positive for one drug but she didn’t want her parents to find out about all of this so she says she paid out of pocket in cash and received the results via phone call. she says that since she receive the results from a phone call, they didn’t send her any email or paper copy of the results to back her up. there’s no proof at all that she was drugged whatsoever. it’s now september of 2023 and still nothing. we told m that if she tested positive then she needs go to the police because that means someone know well and invited to the party was drugging people and we want to know who that is. she said no because “she wanted to find out for herself and didn’t have any ulterior motives???” i know, her explanation made no sense. this whole situation caused a massive falling out. i’m talking from best friends to being cut off forever type falling out. two of my housemates believed m with their whole hearts and don’t seem to give a shit about b. they believe m was drugged and that’s why she was acting that way. myself and the rest of my housemates don’t believe m for a second and we think she just doesn’t want to get in trouble. these two housemates now don’t talk to us. they think that we are somehow assholes for not believing our friend and if we don’t want to be friends with m anymore then we aren’t friends with them either. they still are best friends with m and have gone about the rest of senior year as if nothing happened. they refused to talk about the situation unless it’s praising m and the whole house was awkward and was tension filled until graduation. here’s where i could be the asshole but i wanted to say my personal belief of what i think happened: i think m process what she did to b and realized the consequences that could happen to her. she could be kicked out of the school, have criminal charges against her, be socially exiled, etc. i think she freaked out and tried to come up with ways that could get her out of this and clear her name. i think she thought if she said she was drugged that could cancel out what she did because she “was acting out of character.” however she has to somehow say she was drugged without medically proving it or filing a report or going to the school or for god sakes at the bare minimum, find out who did it. there’s too many red flags and my gut tells me m is lying. going forward, when we would be out at the bars and see m, there was immediately tension. m would be “accidentally” pushing and shoving us because she would be so angry we were out. it’s probably a reminder for her of what she did. i was even out with some girls on the soccer team and one girl spit on m which was not gonna lie pretty damn funny. still this ruined my and my other housemates senior year. but again we have gotten into boarder line physical alternations with m and my two housemates don’t care at all and still love m. it pisses me off how two people could be so blind (in my opinion). so what do you all think? am i the asshole not believing m? (pleaseeeee gimme your thoughts, it's been months and i can't stop thinking about all of this and it's making me second guess everything because the year was so fucked)",AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/16f5i0j/aita_for_not_believing_my_friend_when_she_says/,0
16f5go0,reckless driving while suspended,"last night i left a car meet in minnesota, did a burnout but literally for 0.9 seconds and no smoke came out. a hiding trooper saw it, and when i left the meet, i mistakenly went the one way. pulled me over, cited me for reckless driving, and driving during suspension, also for going one way, and having no license present, as i lost my wallet and couldn’t go to the dmv as it was the weekend. i told the officer that i did not know i was suspended, as i moved out of my house a year ago, and i was no longer living in that county on file. he charged me anyway and impounded my gt500 for a day. he thought i might be drunk, which i wasn’t, accepted for a breathalyzer, and blew triple 0’s. this is my 2nd reckless driving ticket. in minnesota, reckless driving and driving while suspension is a misdemeanor, and the rest is a petty. how screwed am i? should i be maybe expecting a jail sentence when i appear the mandetory court?",legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/16f5go0/reckless_driving_while_suspended/,0

16f5dkw,20 [m4f] uk/anywhere - this is the ultimate! *intro video and slideshow*,"# introduction hello there gamers, i'm jamie. so as you probably noticed in the title, i'm going to be trying something different that i've not really seen used a lot before in the form of an intro video and slideshow. i've always had these sort of ""creative spurts"" as i call them and i thought why not make something for this as i think it would be more creative and unique compared to your average post... anyway i'm rambling, let's get into how this works. as a quick side note for those curious, the title of the post is a reference to sonic adventure 2 :d so i've tried to craft this in a way that appeases both the long post enjoyers and the short post enjoyers and it works like this, if your one of those people that likes long posts with lots of information then this is where i'm gonna do it so you can stay right here if you like that. if however, you enjoy shorter posts with less information but a lot more personality sprinkled into it then the slideshow will be for you. you can even go through both if you want if you have a lot of time on your hands xd. the intro video can be seen as ""free dlc"", you don't have to watch it but it is there if you want that extra content (intro video will be in this post as well as the slideshow). so if you want to head to the slideshow now then feel free to do so but before you do, this is my face if physical attraction matters to you: [ LINK now, here's the slideshow for you gamers: [pog slideshow : isupposeso13 (reddit.com)]( LINK just one more thing before we start, if you found me interesting enough to message after all of this, please include an intro describing who you are along with your interests as well as a picture of yourself. i will not be responding to people with ""hi's"" and ""hello's"" # about me and who i'm looking for so, i'm a 20 year old dude with long brown hair and eyes, i am around 6'3-6'4 tall, 70kg and i'm a bit muscly (more on that later). personality wise, i'm a fairly introverted dude, doesn't really stray from his friend group too often (probably because i prefer staying indoors than going out) although that's probably gonna change soon as i'm heading to university soon to do law :d. for those curious, i have done a personality test and i came out as an infp so whoever wants to pick that apart, feel free to do so. around my friends, i am fairly sarcastic a majority of the time as that's my sorta sense of humour but when the time does call for it, i am able to jump to a more caring demeanour and empathise with whomever i'm with so don't worry about not having someone you can open up to emotionally as i'm always ready for a heart to heart and i'm a fairly emotional guy myself so :). interest wise, i'll touch on the most prevalent ones with those being: video games, working out, memes, voice acting and video editing (more on all of these later). as for who i'm looking for, i would like an egalitarian relationship ( [egalitarian relationship: definition & example | study.com]( LINK for those who don't know what that is), with someone who is also a gamer (more on why later), and someone who will be there for me as i will be there for them. if your also someone who is able to bounce jokes back and forth then that is a massive plus as i do enjoy doing that but it's cool if your not able to do that. physical attraction does matter to be a little bit but it's certainly not everything so don't worry if your not too much of a looker, i'm not too picky about that sort of stuff :) # video games ok, so now we're gonna touch on my interests a bit more in depth starting with video games. i'm a massive gamer who pretty much plays on the pc (i have my own setup and everything if you want to see and compare). i do have a ps4 but i don't use it and i'm planning to get a steam deck soon so i'm pretty excited for that. the games/franchises i'm fairly invested into right now is: * destiny 2 * team fortress 2 * sonic the hedgehog * pvz garden warfare * fnaf * undertale/deltarune so, if your interested in those franchises, that'll be pretty cool but if not, that's fine and perhaps i could introduce you to them as you could introduce me to some of your games, i'm always open to playing more stuff :d # working out ok, i workout so naturally i will be a bit muscly but at least for now, that muscle only really shows when i flex but i'm not really too bothered if that's the only way i'll be able to show my muscles because it's really funny seeing people's reactions when the skinny looking guy is not actually entirely skinny xd. anyway, i workout around 5 times per week and i kept that up for a couple months but i recently took a week break just to make sure i don't get burnt out but i'm back to it now so hopefully some more will come out of that soon. you can see a pic if you want once we've known each other for a bit first # memes so, i have a pretty sarcastic sense of humour as i've said earlier and memes play a very big part in that. i have a whole stash of them ranging from really funny to downright cringe so expect that at a moment's notice >:). perhaps we could even share our stashes if you also have one. so if you ever need a meme, i'll always have you covered. maybe i'll buy some meme related items in the future to help sell the point i'm a memer, who knows # voice acting i haven't voice acted anything in quite a while but the passion is still there so i'll probably return to it eventually when i have the time. in the past, i've mostly dubbed over sonic for fun since i just think he's a fairly neat character to voice. will i voice act professionally in the future for some extra money? maybe but we'll see. i even have my own little space that i voice act from which is also my gamer space, i have the acoustic foam on the wall and mic and everything, it's pretty pog if you want to see it at some point :) # video editing so this is a pretty new interest for me. i've done video editing in the past for my voice acting but nothing too crazy. my passion for it actually started from making this intro video as at first when creating the intro, i thought it was gonna be a slog that i wouldn't be able to get the hang of but in the end, i actually found it really fun to edit in clips together and add effects and audio sync everything so i'm hopeful i'll return to do more videos in the future as there is potential for a lot of fun there # my dealbreakers so i do have some deabreakers but it's not a lot so let's race through this quickly and hopefully your still here by the end: * no heavy drinkers or smokers (i personally do not drink or smoke anything at all. i don't mind if you drink but please be responsible and don't drink until your drunk, i don't want to have to deal with that. as for smokers, i just personally don't find smokers of any kind attractive so if you smoke anything, please do not message me) * no illegal drug users of any kind * any non gamers (this may be a bit strange but gaming is pretty much at the forefront of my personality. i would like our main way of bonding to be gaming. i'm sure all you non gamers are great people but i think if your not a gamer, it probably won't work out unfortunately) * dry texters (i've personally dealt with many dry texters and i personally find them really infuriating to talk to as you can't get anywhere with them so if you expect me to carry the conversation and it not be a collective effort, please just do not message me) # your dealbreakers so i made this section because i do have some things that may turn some people away so i figured it's better to get them out of the way now rather than later: * i have a deformity (i know deformity's aren't really attractive to some so i'm just letting you know i have a chest deformity called pectus excavatum. it gives the chest a sunken in appearance. it doesn't really cause me many problems so it's just a cosmetic thing but ye) * i'm fairly clingy (i also know that some people do not like clingy people so i'm just letting you know now that when i get attached, i really get attached so i'm just warning you xd) * i'm an atheist (i know some people are religious and want their partner to be religious with them as well but i don't believe in any sort of god or religion or anything. i personally have no resentment towards religion and i certainly wouldn't berate my partner if she was religious but if you want a religious partner then i'm not the guy for you i'm afraid) * it takes me a bit to warm up to the idea of a voice or video call (i know some people want to jump into that sort of stuff right away but i'm just not comfortable doing that sort of thing at such an early point so, sorry about that :( # closing comments so that was me, i know this post isn't perfect but this is the first time i've done some unique stuff in my post so hopefully i can improve this sort of thing over time by improving the format of this post along with the slideshow and intro video. so if any of this has interested you feel free to send me an intro of you along with a picture of yourself. take care and enjoy the intro video: [ LINK (sorry about the lighting and positioning and stuff in advance, sorta had to work with what i had :/",r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/16f5dkw/20_m4f_ukanywhere_this_is_the_ultimate_intro/,0

about me and who i'm looking for so, i'm a 20 year old dude with long brown hair and eyes, i am around 6'3-6'4 tall, 70kg and i'm a bit muscly (more on that later). personality wise, i'm a fairly introverted dude, doesn't really stray from his friend group too often (probably because i prefer staying indoors than going out) although that's probably gonna change soon as i'm heading to university soon to do law :d. for those curious, i have done a personality test and i came out as an infp so whoever wants to pick that apart, feel free to do so. around my friends, i am fairly sarcastic a majority of the time as that's my sorta sense of humour but when the time does call for it, i am able to jump to a more caring demeanour and empathise with whomever i'm with so don't worry about not having someone you can open up to emotionally as i'm always ready for a heart to heart and i'm a fairly emotional guy myself so :). interest wise, i'll touch on the most prevalent ones with those being: video games, working out, memes, voice acting and video editing (more on all of these later). as for who i'm looking for, i would like an egalitarian relationship ( [egalitarian relationship: definition & example | study.com]( LINK for those who don't know what that is), with someone who is also a gamer (more on why later), and someone who will be there for me as i will be there for them. if your also someone who is able to bounce jokes back and forth then that is a massive plus as i do enjoy doing that but it's cool if your not able to do that. physical attraction does matter to be a little bit but it's certainly not everything so don't worry if your not too much of a looker, i'm not too picky about that sort of stuff :) # video games ok, so now we're gonna touch on my interests a bit more in depth starting with video games. i'm a massive gamer who pretty much plays on the pc (i have my own setup and everything if you want to see and compare). i do have a ps4 but i don't use it and i'm planning to get a steam deck soon so i'm pretty excited for that. the games/franchises i'm fairly invested into right now is: * destiny 2 * team fortress 2 * sonic the hedgehog * pvz garden warfare * fnaf * undertale/deltarune so, if your interested in those franchises, that'll be pretty cool but if not, that's fine and perhaps i could introduce you to them as you could introduce me to some of your games, i'm always open to playing more stuff :d # working out ok, i workout so naturally i will be a bit muscly but at least for now, that muscle only really shows when i flex but i'm not really too bothered if that's the only way i'll be able to show my muscles because it's really funny seeing people's reactions when the skinny looking guy is not actually entirely skinny xd. anyway, i workout around 5 times per week and i kept that up for a couple months but i recently took a week break just to make sure i don't get burnt out but i'm back to it now so hopefully some more will come out of that soon. you can see a pic if you want once we've known each other for a bit first # memes so, i have a pretty sarcastic sense of humour as i've said earlier and memes play a very big part in that. i have a whole stash of them ranging from really funny to downright cringe so expect that at a moment's notice >:). perhaps we could even share our stashes if you also have one. so if you ever need a meme, i'll always have you covered. maybe i'll buy some meme related items in the future to help sell the point i'm a memer, who knows # voice acting i haven't voice acted anything in quite a while but the passion is still there so i'll probably return to it eventually when i have the time. in the past, i've mostly dubbed over sonic for fun since i just think he's a fairly neat character to voice. will i voice act professionally in the future for some extra money? maybe but we'll see. i even have my own little space that i voice act from which is also my gamer space, i have the acoustic foam on the wall and mic and everything, it's pretty pog if you want to see it at some point :) # video editing so this is a pretty new interest for me. i've done video editing in the past for my voice acting but nothing too crazy. my passion for it actually started from making this intro video as at first when creating the intro, i thought it was gonna be a slog that i wouldn't be able to get the hang of but in the end, i actually found it really fun to edit in clips together and add effects and audio sync everything so i'm hopeful i'll return to do more videos in the future as there is potential for a lot of fun there # my dealbreakers so i do have some deabreakers but it's not a lot so let's race through this quickly and hopefully your still here by the end: * no heavy drinkers or smokers (i personally do not drink or smoke anything at all. i don't mind if you drink but please be responsible and don't drink until your drunk, i don't want to have to deal with that. as for smokers, i just personally don't find smokers of any kind attractive so if you smoke anything, please do not message me) * no illegal drug users of any kind * any non gamers (this may be a bit strange but gaming is pretty much at the forefront of my personality. i would like our main way of bonding to be gaming. i'm sure all you non gamers are great people but i think if your not a gamer, it probably won't work out unfortunately) * dry texters (i've personally dealt with many dry texters and i personally find them really infuriating to talk to as you can't get anywhere with them so if you expect me to carry the conversation and it not be a collective effort, please just do not message me) # your dealbreakers so i made this section because i do have some things that may turn some people away so i figured it's better to get them out of the way now rather than later: * i have a deformity (i know deformity's aren't really attractive to some so i'm just letting you know i have a chest deformity called pectus excavatum. it gives the chest a sunken in appearance. it doesn't really cause me many problems so it's just a cosmetic thing but ye) * i'm fairly clingy (i also know that some people do not like clingy people so i'm just letting you know now that when i get attached, i really get attached so i'm just warning you xd) * i'm an atheist (i know some people are religious and want their partner to be religious with them as well but i don't believe in any sort of god or religion or anything. i personally have no resentment towards religion and i certainly wouldn't berate my partner if she was religious but if you want a religious partner then i'm not the guy for you i'm afraid) * it takes me a bit to warm up to the idea of a voice or video call (i know some people want to jump into that sort of stuff right away but i'm just not comfortable doing that sort of thing at such an early point so, sorry about that :( # closing comments so that was me, i know this post isn't perfect but this is the first time i've done some unique stuff in my post so hopefully i can improve this sort of thing over time by improving the format of this post along with the slideshow and intro video. so if any of this has interested you feel free to send me an intro of you along with a picture of yourself. take care and enjoy the intro video: [ LINK (sorry about the lighting and positioning and stuff in advance, sorta had to work with what i had :/",ForeverAloneDating,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/16f5djt/20_m4f_ukanywhere_this_is_the_ultimate_intro/,0
16f5crn,"severe anxiety is making me so physically ill, mimicking cancer markers and diagnosis","since covid hit (2020) i spiralled out of control with my anxiety. the news media had infiltrated my mind and it started with week long insomnia brought on about potentially dying from covid. then came the autoimmune symptoms presumably triggered by stress. then came the bad food choices and lack of exercise due to anxiety, paranoia and depression. i was reading news constantly and doom scrolling. so over two years now, my inflammation has gotten completely out of control. every symptom imaginable had surfaced. my blood work shows an infection somewhere (viral or bacterial), super high inflammation likened to several autoimmune diseases, white blood cell counts similar to cancers, and all globulins out of whack. i’ve had every medical test imaginable outside of super invasive ones reserved for specific diagnosis. i’ve been seeing 5 specialists and recently had a hospital stay / investigation. during this time i never saw a psychologist / psychiatrist or taken anything for anxiety. i also don’t drink nor smoke. imagine this - over four days of blood testing at the hospital stay, all my markers decreased. because i felt calmer and safer being at the hospital, my anxiety lessened. i have also been spending time outdoors in the forest. again, had a bunch of tests to ensure nothing sinister and the diagnosis - severe chronic anxiety and stress. all of this because of stress and anxiety. it makes me want to cry, how debilitating this disease is - and how stuck one can be in the medical / life spiral, having trouble getting out. the physical body follows and it’s horrific. i don’t want to take pills to control my mind but at this point, i’m feeling desperate to feel better. i feel like i’ve been floating in a void of despair and agony. has anyone had a similar extreme situation?",Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16f5crn/severe_anxiety_is_making_me_so_physically_ill/,0

16f5bas,weird ear sensations and pressure,"hello, so recently in late july - after my b-day i had my rotten tooth pulled out by dentist because of ugly pain and huge abcess in jaw that was spreading under the jaw and neck... i was given antibiotics (penicilin) bc of slight fever, chills and general unwell feeling and treatment lasted for about a week and my abcess and fever dissapeared... but after that i began getting this wierd pressure on both sides of my neck going into both ears - the pressure is not painful - its just a pressure on both sides of neck right under the ears and feeling of closure in ears - similar to when water get into your ears and it feels plugged. then it stops... overall feels like pressure getting into head.. again its not painful. it happens when iam drinking green tea or when i smoke (i smoke one cig a day) and sometimes during running or working out but all these happenings are all over the place and its not always happening during those activities ... sometimes when i get up fast from bed for example. its not happening strictly all the time... just sometimes almost daily for 5 weeks. iam 36 years old and skinny fat - mostly skinny but i want to lose weight. i have very mild mvp on my heart and overall reasonably healthy. sometimes i suffer from hyperventilation and panic attacks. &#x200b; i would like to know what these sensations would be... i guess it doesnt have to be tied to the dental procedure and it could be something else... i wear ear pluggs when sleeping and perhaps i got an ear infection from wearing it...? i dont know really and i would like to hear some input or suggestions. &#x200b; thank you very much in advance ! <3",AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/16f5bas/weird_ear_sensations_and_pressure/,0

16f4zpr,my (27f) ex boyfriend (27m) and my best friend (27f) saw each other behind my back.,"originally posted to r/aita but they don’t allow relationship stuff. i’ve asked this to various friends and my therapist over the years, but i could never be sure if they were just trying to make me feel better or not. i’ll try to keep it succinct. my best friend of 15 years and i were very close. one thing that always bothered me, however, was that all of my boyfriends tried to date her either before, during, or after dating me. she always denied the latter two categories because she insisted she would “never do that” to me, i.e. date someone i had already dated or be involved in cheating. she’s very attractive, both physically and mentally, and always has guys all over her. but she rarely dates them for her own personal reasons. i had a boyfriend that i dated for 4 years. we lived together with my best friend. at one point, my boyfriend suggested we open our relationship (he wanted certain things sexually that i wasn’t comfortable doing) and at the same time expressed interest in my best friend and wondered if we would ever have a threesome. i said i was uncomfortable with that idea but i was willing to try being open. it didn’t work out and we later broke up for unrelated reasons about 2 years later. after we broke up, the three of us became very close platonically. i did notice that he kept trying to be close with her physically but whenever i asked my best friend about it she said there was nothing going on between them and it didn’t make her uncomfortable. my mom saw this, though, and suggested to me that they were seeing each other behind my back. when i brought this up to my best friend, she was very offended and once again told me she would never do that to me. fast forward two years. the three of us are still roommates, with our own rooms. the ex and i have gotten different jobs and the best friend lost hers and was looking for a new one. she had savings but this did mean she relied a little more on my ex and i, which neither of us minded. at this time i had dabbled in dating over the years and had just started a serious relationship. tmk, my ex had still not dated anyone after me. i noticed that he was getting even closer to my friend, as in sharing the same spot on the couch together and cuddling. at one point i asked my ex if they were seeing each other. he said no. i told him if he did decide to ask her out to please tell me first so it didn’t blindside me. he said okay. as things seemed to continue to progress with them, i found i kept asking my best friend if they were seeing each other and telling her that she could tell me, talk to me about it, etc. but she kept telling me nothing was going on. months later, i asked her once again and she finally came clean. he confessed his feelings a while back and asked if she felt the same. she said she didn’t know, and he kissed her. he continued to be “romantic” towards her (she never elaborated on what that meant) and because she didn’t have a job, she didn’t feel comfortable telling him off because she was worried if she retaliated in any way he would kick her out. i reassured her that i would never let that happen and implored her to talk to both my ex and i and we could figure things out. i also told her that if she decided she did want to pursue the relationship that i would try my best to be okay with it, even though it did make me uncomfortable. she replied that if i ever became too uncomfortable with the whole situation to let her know and she would end things immediately. a few more months passed. we had this cycle of her trying to be more honest with me by telling me nothing had been happening, then would break down crying and admit things had. i became really concerned about her and tried to not let them be alone and confronted my ex multiple times but he just kept saying that as an ex who was dating someone else it was none of my business. she started smoking weed, drinking, and messing with prescription drugs to mentally escape the stress of our strained friendship, not having a job, etc. this really only worsened everything. at one point, she wanted to pick me up from work, but i was worried she had been getting fucked up as she did every night and told her not to. she insisted and then never showed up. when i came home, i could hear them in her room, talking and laughing. i announced that i was home and several minutes later they came out. both were obviously fucked up and my ex was half-dressed. i got pissed, said i wasn’t stupid and was sick of the lies. they continued to tell me i was mistaken and nothing was going on, they were just talking. skipping over some other drama…eventually, i told my friends didn’t think any of this was okay, i was uncomfortable, and i really think it needed to end. she said something i would’ve never expected her to say: “don’t make me choose between you.” she went on to say that my ex seemed to really have feelings for her and since she was such good friends with him beforehand, this might be her “only chance” at a sincere relationship. and by telling her that i wanted things to stop, i was getting in the way of that. we fought for a while and things were tense for a few days but she didn’t want to talk about it. covid hit, and she made up an excuse to move back in with her parents (she later told me she lied because she couldn’t handle the stress of the house anymore). eventually my ex and i moved out as well, with him going back to the state we came from to live with his parents and i got an apartment on my own. this was in 2020 and our friendship has been strained ever since. we talk every few months, usually with her apologizing for the conversation gap, telling me that she’s just going through a lot and she still loves me and misses me. i only brought up the situation once and she just said “i think we all could’ve handled it better” before moving on. i now haven’t heard from her since april. i’ve reached out on multiple platforms and she still hasn’t gotten back to me, although she did respond to a flirtatious message from a friend of mine so i know she’s alive/still checks her socials. i’ve been debating whether or not to bring everything up again and apologize, but the thing is i don’t really know what to apologize for or how. sorry for the insanely long post but i gave the bare minimum context. should i just let her respond to me when/if she’s ready? is it worth bringing up? was i a bad friend?

16f4y3b,bad trip aftermath,"i know i know “no such thing as a bad trip”, i used to be in the same boat and never ever thought i would ever have anything close to one… the trip started off great me and my bud were in high hopes and super pumped to trip together, couple hours go by and our environment (pool) was getting too hectic and i was getting in my head too deep with way too many people around us. we leave and go to the apartment where i see myself in the mirror. i had gotten sunburnt despite my constant sunscreen application and the lsd made it look so pink and my eyelashes looked so dark in comparison. it looked like heavy mascara. i was looking real rough. we went and smoked and then i began having occasional thoughts that i might come off as a super feminine man and then i started thinking about the way i present myself. every word that was spoken because some sort of sexual disgusting comment and my head was just full of vile things. we headed to the apartment 4 of us were laying around watching trippy videos and the entire time i’m just in my head and having the most awful awful thoughts i’m tearing up just thinking about this and during all this i had the delusion that for the past year of my life i was presenting myself as an extremely feminine man and that i essentially looked like a girl and didn’t fall into societal gender norms. i began thinking of how i look from their eyes and i created this entire woman identity for myself and for the next hour or two i fell into this delusion that i was actually a woman. my other roommate (don’t trip while dealing with roommate issues, obvious in hindsight) wouldn’t leave us alone and was prodding us because of our pupils so we said we were on adderall but then we got sketched he was going to use this against us or something. we were scared. we decided we needed to get out of there so we went to a ufc fight party his buddy was hosting and it was so awkward because i was still wired and low key tripping and then i began to get in my head because i didn’t have any plans for the night. i knew if i went to bed with all this fucked up shit on my mind i would not be okay the next day. luckily i was able to meet with some friends and eat with them and stuff (didn’t talk about the trip at all they’re not into that). overall, i am glad that i was able to land from that trip “okay”, but this was a super bad experience for me and right now i’m not feeling the way i normally do in the mornings i’m having a real rough time…",LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/16f4y3b/bad_trip_aftermath/,0

16f4w77,2 months post quitting and need help,"i quit vaping 2 months ago. for context, i started smoking 6 years ago. i quit and switched to vaping a year after i started smoking. i've been vaping for almost 5 years. i started with the juul 5%, was going through like 3 pods a week (i know.) did this for 3 years. switched to 3% juul pods, same thing, 3 pods a week. did this for 1 1/2 years. finally dropped down to 1.8% vuse and used this for the remainder of the time, up to when i quit. i probably went through 2 pods a week here, so i decreased my usage too. anywhere, i told my doctor i wanted to quit. i tried to go cold-turkey and felt like i was actually dying. symptoms: severely dizzy, felt like i was going to faint perpetually. i was getting sick (vomitting). i couldn't focus on anything and couldn't remember anything (severe brain fog and short term memory loss). i was also disassociating (didn't feel like i was in reality). doc told me it was severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms, suggested welburtin. i quit the first time for a month using welbutrin, minimal symptoms but relapsed after a month because of a moment of weakness. finally quit again using welbutrin and will never go back. now, the question, has anyone else here who quit also experienced this? i have days where my lungs feel so clear and healthy and i feel like i could run a marathon (and have actually picked up running). however, i also have mornings where my lungs hurt and it feels like i'm trying to breathe through water almost. can anyone give me insight on this? i'd appreciate it and thank you for taking the time to read this. tl;dr quit, 2 months in, have times where lungs are super sore and feel like i'm breathing through water. other days, lungs feel super clear and strong.",QuitVaping,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/16f4w77/2_months_post_quitting_and_need_help/,0

16f4r8p,[update] oop's boyfriend almost died in her arms,"**i am not oop. please do not harass oop.** originally posted in r/offmychest by u/princesspeachkitty 1 update - short **links:** [original]( LINK \- sept. 2, 2023 update was an edit to the original post ... trigger warnings: >!medical trauma, near-death experience!< mood spoilers: >!inconclusive but mostly positive!< … # [original]( LINK - sept. 2, 2023 i still don't know what the hell happened. we ate dinner. we smoked some weed. we laid down on the floor together. i thought he fell asleep, he started snoring but then it was almost like choking and he wouldn't respond to me yelling or shaking him and he started to drool and shake and his eyes were open but unfocused and he couldn't breathe and his pulse was so weak and i'm calling 911 just fucking shaking. i've never seen someone unresponsive and in that state, the man i love was literally slipping away in front of me, he had no idea i was in front of him trying to wake him. they told me to start giving him chest compressions, thank gods for the bee gees, the emt's were there in less that 6 minutes. they took over the compressions, used the mask pump thing to help him breathe, i don't even know what else. everything was moving so fast, there were like 9 people in the room, i was trying to tell his mom what was going on and he came to, fully alert, terribly confused. while i'm listening to them talk to him and trying to soothe him i hear them say he lost his pulse for a minute there. he fucking died on our bedroom floor, and props to the emt's, they were so calm and collected i didn't even know it until after they had him back. i'm sitting in the er, waiting to see him & i feel like i'm still waiting to breathe. i just needed to type this out, i'm so scared for him, nothing really reminds you how much you love someone than them almost dying (dying?). it feels surreal to even fucking type that. excuse the terrible punctuations/run-ons/etc. as they are the least of my concerns atm &#x200b; **relevant comments:** *oh my gosh. well done op. you saved his life.* \- **headfullofpesticides** &#x200b; *one night i smoked a joint around 2am of weed that i had smoked a few times previously with no issues. i had drank a bit of wine as well and went to bed right after. i woke up around 6am and drove to the store to get some ingredients to make breakfast for my gf and i.* *i remember everything up until i finished making the breakfast. apparently i then went upstairs to ask my gf who was still in bed if she wanted breakfast. she told me i stopped mid conversation and started following something in the room with my finger and starring off blankly, almost if something was flying around the room. i then hit the floor in a full tonic-clonic seizure. i had never had one before. i don’t remember any of this. she called 911 and apparently i got up after about 5 minutes fully disoriented and was trying to run away from her. i guess i almost jumped off the 2nd floor banister. she said she was holding me back with all of her strength.* *paramedics got there after about 10 minutes and took me to the hospital via ambulance. they ran all tests and i came back negative for marijuana. it was synthetic weed. i had smoked it twice before with no ill effects. a friend had given it to me and he did not know either. scary shit. i have no had another seizure since and it’s been almost 10’ years.* *glad your bf is better and i’m sorry you had to experience that. it scarred my (now ex) for life apparently haha.* \- **janewalch** ... # update so, first of all thank you to everyone for your support and advice and stories, they were wonderfully distracting and helped calm me down a bit. unfortunately, this update isn't all too interesting, but the boyfriend got released, they took some blood and ran a couple tests and they just.....let him go? and told him to keep an eye out for the results? i never even got to speak to him or the doctors before all of this, and i'm still really angry, as is his mom. they said that he was healthy as a normal human and they don't know what happened which is infuriating. they told him to schedule a follow-up, gave him some zofran and fluids and told him to rest. all his test results will be uploaded online, so we will be able to see what there is to see, but i'm definitely going to push he gets checked for sleep apnea. i will reiterate that i love & trust my partner and i know he hasn't been taking opiods or any other drug of that caliber. in regards to the weed --- he's been smoking for years, we've been buying from the same people for awhile now and as far as i know they didn't treat him for an allergy. doesn't mean we won't be treading very carefully around our flower now, it's just very unlikely that the weed was the cause. even though we're still left wondering what the hell happened, i'm at least glad that he's stable enough to be home and in his bed. if anything interesting happens with his diagnosis, i'll update again. for now, i'm going to go take care of my boyfriend. thank you guys so much two_hearts … &#x200b; marked as **ongoing:** we didn't get any definitive answer on what happened to oop's bf. hopefully any future follow-ups only bring positive news and that he doesn't end up back in the er anytime soon &#x200b; **i am not oop. please do not harass oop.**",BORUpdates,https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/16f4r8p/update_oops_boyfriend_almost_died_in_her_arms/,0

16f4omn,connected a thought i often have to an.,"there's a very existentialist notion (i think it's pretty much core to existentialism) that life has no meaning except what we ascribe to it. if you ask them, people often say that their ""meaning"" in life boils down to the things they consume or the little treats they give themselves or other hedonistic pursuits to distract themselves from what is otherwise, even often by their own admissions, a pretty shitty time existing. even when i have been in therapy, all of it always pretty much boiled down to ""distract yourself from life."" (a lot of younger people have taken to calling this ""happy nihilism"" or ""positive nihilism"" or some other kind of stupid cringey thing along those lines to make it sound more profound even though there's very little actual philosophical thought behind it). none of that ever made sense to me. if my life's ""meaning"" is the taste of a food i like or playing some video game on the rare occasions i have motivation to do anything, or, as a lot of people now seem to think, going to superspreader locations/events to get and spread disease recreationally, then what is the point in ""meaning"" at all? how does any of that make all of this worthwhile? what good is an existence of which, often by their admission, the goal is to distract oneself from it? especially with hedonistic pursuits which can never actually be satisfied, as pointed out by people like schopenhauer. i am preaching to the choir here, but every time i think about people talking about their so-called ""meaning"" in life and then they mention that ""meaning"" being something completely asinine or mindlessly distracting oneself from the experience of being alive, it drives me up the wall because it makes no sense to me whatsoever. it seems like inflating and giving some kind of arbitrary spiritual significance to what are ultimately just selfish indulgences, rationalizing them post hoc while simultaneously blowing smoke up their own asses by pretending that they're enlightened for doing so. as for me, i refuse to say my life has any meaning whatsoever. it was the result of an impulsive act by two irresponsible, selfish people who didn't even love eachother, and i have never enjoyed being here. i've never enjoyed the performance of conspicuous consumption or indulging in things and even if you want to throw in things like education and enrichment none of those things give my life any ""meaning"" and if i had never been born to experience them, i wouldn't miss them, and i also wouldn't have had to experience all the hardship i've also endured with every other aspect of life that i am supposed to constantly seek refuge from. i enjoy the taste of some foods, i like playing video games, i like intellectual pursuits, and i intend to keep experiencing them, because, fuck, i'm at the party now, might as well, but things which cause fleeting dopamine reactions in my brain don't have any greater significance to me, they're not part of some great ""human experience"", and if i never experienced them i wouldn't be ""missing out."" sisyphus can lie to himself and tell himself there is some magical reason for rolling that boulder up a hill, sure, good for him i guess, but that's still just a story he tells himself, and i have never understood why it's somehow my duty to have one when i was brought here without my consent, and i think it's stupid to do so. my boulder is just a boulder and i am glad that i will not create another sisyphus myself.",antinatalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/16f4omn/connected_a_thought_i_often_have_to_an/,0

16f4e8y,"being ""different"" ist just annoying and i don't know what to do.","myself being a male hsp is just annoying, it feels like i'm different from 90% of the people nearby. and their understanding is not on a high level. why can't most just understand the fact, that i'm not interested in some things, especially things most men like. first of all, most like video games, i do aswell, but there the list ends, i'm not that interested in sport like basketball or smth, football is okay, but not my life, going to the gym is nice aswell but not my life, like most don't understand why i go to the gym because most males i know are going there to be bodybuilders and be 30m wide. i don't want to, i just want to be fit, healthy and just look decent in my eyes. but they don't understand it. furthermore they don't understand that i have literally zero interest in cars and mopeds, they forget it aswell, showing me some cars and mopeds and asking me, if i like those sick cars and mopeds and which i would like to have, telling them, that any car with 5 seats, some new technology, so life won't be a hell and 4 wheels isn't enough for them, they want some clear car models, but i don't know any. in germany it is pretty common to drink beer, when with friends or on a party etc. their mouths are wide open, if i tell them, that i hate the taste of beer and booze in general. they don't understand why i am dying next to them, if they smoke, because it's normal and others just don't say anything. i even get called boring when i don't want to go to parties and get my sense knocked off by this disgusting techno music and loud noises everywhere. when i was in class, our teacher asked me, which music i'm listening to in my free time, i told him, that i really love music with a hard lyrical touch and a deep meaning, artists like vin jay, gawne and ekoh are my heart. but even after telling that, some classmates were like ""woooow, ur so special and ur music taste is above everyone's"". and that doenst bounce off, it hits me directly to my heart, i felt wrong for listening to music. the worst part is, that some thought i'd be gay, cause i love to write texts and express my emotions in them, just showing emotions as a male is considered gay??? i am straight. i don't even wanna date, because i'm scared of all these comments and ghosting habits most people created, only if they'd know it is killing me. just to be clear, the comments i got by those other people were by males and females, but most things happened with males, because i know more males then females, i'm not a misandrist or smth like that, i always try to see the good in people, even if it's sometimes hard. i'm really clueless right now and don't know how to cope with that, i'm not suicidal or smth, but it kills me, i don't fit in anywhere and it sucks.",hsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/16f4e8y/being_different_ist_just_annoying_and_i_dont_know/,0

16f4dr8,my ex was being dishonest for months,"hey, reddit community, i (24f) recently went through a tough breakup with my boyfriend (35m) of 2.5 years, and i need some guidance and support. our relationship faced a significant hurdle when i discovered he was secretly smoking behind my back, something that had been going on for the last 6 months. here's a bit of backstory: we come from very different backgrounds. i've always been driven by my parents' emphasis on education and building a successful career. i'm proud to say i've managed to buy a house, own a car, and secure a good tech job. on the other hand, my ex, who grew up with absent parents, started smoking at a young age, never finished school, and has a customer service job that barely covers his rent. despite our differences, we deeply loved each other, and i saw a future together. i encouraged him to save, seek better job prospects, learn to drive, and eventually buy a house. he also wanted to quit smoking as it was draining his finances. we smoke weed together but i don't smoke tobacco on its own. to support him, i offered to buy the tobacco and keep it to prevent temptation. he agreed. however, i recently discovered that he had been buying tobacco secretly for months. now, after 2.5 years, not much progress has been made in his personal life, and i'm left heartbroken and questioning where to go from here. i hate the dishonesty so much, i have been questioning everything. he has been apologising and crying, but ehen i asked him how long this would have gone on for if i hadn't caught him, he said he doesn't know. so to me it seems he is apologetic only because he got caught. i'd appreciate your advice and insights on how to navigate this challenging situation and help him, as well as any similar experiences you may have had. thank you for listening and being a supportive community. broken_heart folded_hands ",BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16f4dr8/my_ex_was_being_dishonest_for_months/,0

16f4d5c,"23m ""dumped"" me (19f) because apparently, i am an attention seeker who can't think for myself. how do i know if he's just projecting his insecurities onto me or if i really do have to change myself?","""dumped"" because we weren't officially dating. i was talking to 23m for a month before he ended things with me. during the entire month, we were both very straightforward with each other. i was, at least. idk if he was. he wasn't *everything* i wanted but i somehow find the good in other people and have trust in them. he'd always ask for a chance whenever we come across differences that i wasn't sure i cannot accept. although, we only really found out about these differences when we were about to end. for example, i told him that i'm not into smokers but i've dated one but i prefer nonsmokers. he said he has plans stopping next year so he begged for a chance. i gave it because i don't think smoking makes him any less of a person and i did trust that he has plans stopping. i think the breaking point was this second difference we had where he made an offensive joke. i said, i can never date someone with that mindset. i expressed my disappointment to my friends over what he said. they commented that he was a bigot but never really commented anything else, of course. we stopped talking but then after some days he begged for a chance again, saying he never meant for the joke to come out that way and would never do it again. i explained that i dropped him because what he said was insensitive. i straightforwardly said that i would be embarrassed to tell my friends about someone like him, knowing they think he's a bigot. he said he is willing to be educated and to educate himself more about that topic. the understanding (and dumb) part of me took over and believed him. after that, we were okay but then the next 2 days, he would leave me on delivered for hours. mind you, he was on a leave that time and even told me he wasn't busy at all. i would've understood otherwise. after every reply i sent, he would ghost me for 1-5 hours. after that, he suddenly sent a message telling me that he's done with me because ""he doesn't need a woman who is an attention seeker and can't think for herself"". i was so confused because i didn't know what he was talking about. apparently, attention seeker because i like posting myself and i get a lot of (unwanted) attention from other men. can't think for myself because he thinks i dropped him the other time because my friends told me he was a bigot. the thing is, i post myself on my private social media that barely has 200 followers because i'm confident in who i am. i post for myself because it makes me feel better about myself. i get unwanted attention from lots of men but i ignored them all because i only talk to one person at a time. and i dropped him before i even told my friends so obviously, i didn't need their opinion to make a decision. he even added that ""i don't wanna date someone who constantly tells me what to do"", only because i expressed that i preferred nonsmokers and politically liberal people. he considered that as me imposing my standards and beliefs on him when he was the one that kept begging for a chance. at this point, i don't know if i'm in the wrong or if this is just him telling me he's insecure and can't stand feeling that way if he were to date me. i do realize tho, that i should stand my ground more firmly if a guy does something that insensitive again. tl;dr: guy told me these reasons as to why he's done with me when in my pov, things are completely different.",relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16f4d5c/23m_dumped_me_19f_because_apparently_i_am_an/,0

16f4c3p,"old is frustrating (surprise, surprise)","i am very clearly going to be ranting just a little bit as i’m a bit frustrated (as i’m sure a lot of us are). i’d be very interested in hearing about if anyone else relates to some of these things that annoy me or if any of you have specific old pet peeves. the things that are frustrating me at the moment… why don’t people completely fill out their profiles?! i swipe left on every profile that isn’t complete because of 3 reasons. 1 - it kind of shows that you’re lazy. 2 - it makes me wonder if you have something to hide because literally what’s stopping you from taking 2 seconds out of your day to disclose that you smoke cigarettes? lol. 3- i don’t have time to start up 100s of conversations at once just to figure out something you could have easily just put in your profile. it’s so frustrating because i do feel like i’m passing up people i’m probably completely compatible with, but i can’t tell because they don’t bother to disclose the most basic information upfront. is anyone else having this issue? if you’re someone that hasn’t completed your profile then please, for fucks sake, fill it out! you’re probably screwing yourself over with tons of people because of it. i get a lot of matches, sure, but it’s crazy how more than 95% are people that are so clearly not compatible with me (like wanting two completely different things) and yet i keep attracting every person i’d never ever date. i know someones going to try to say “its cause your being picky” but it’s not. if i’m a pansexual woman who isn’t religious with lots of friends and family in the lgbt and minority communities …. naturally you can see why i wouldn’t match with your average christian/conservative, but i constantly get them liking me and i don’t think it has anything to do with where i live. so i get the frustration men have that women get tons of matches, but almost none of those matches are fruitful from the jump so i can’t even just “give them a chance” or “lower my standards”. it’s not like it’s a physical attraction thing or something minor. i literally attract the type of people that would hate everything i am and everything my love ones are. i could get verbally or physically attacked for simply existing in a manner someone else doesn’t like. i think part of it has to do with a lot of people aimlessly swiping and not reading anything. i absolutely hate that so many people do that. this problem would probably be minor if people read profiles. lastly, with the 5% of people i do match with, they. don’t. respond. what’s the point of having dating apps (bumble especially) if you don’t have notifications on or intend on being around often enough to notice you’ve been matched with someone? the worst part is that they do that, but don’t leave behind some kind of alternative form of communication to reach out if the match expires (like an instagram or something) so the match is completely pointless. i’ll keep trying of course, but i definitely want to consider getting to know people in person too. where are good places to meet men and women in los angeles?

16f47ll,"british american tobacco: heads i win, tails i…still win","hello, fellow investors! &#x200b; i have recently added british american tobacco to my portfolio as i believe that its current share price presents an exceptionally compelling risk-reward proposition when weighed against alternative investment opportunities. following is a concise summary of my reasoning that i would like to present for your feedback. **the best opportunities are to be found in bear markets** sooner or later, regardless of how exceptional they are, companies find themselves in the midst of multi-year downturns. it happened to coca cola, pepsico, microsoft, and apple, just to name a few. the only time british american tobacco has been cheaper than today was at the end of the largest civil litigation settlement in u.s. history, which resulted in the tobacco companies paying the states and territories billions of dollars in yearly instalments. *it went then on to become a* ***15-bagger*** *over the subsequent 17 years,* ***not accounting for dividends***. now, the company does currently face noteworthy challenges (i.e. negative secular trends in smoking and a substantial debt burden), but the current valuation seems to be factoring in a higher level of risk than may actually exist. **declining smoking rates** even though smoking rates continue to decline, the company is effectively offsetting the trend through a successful diversification of its product portfolio. the oligopolistic nature of tobacco markets also gives them significant pricing power, especially since demand for their products is relatively inelastic, resulting in inordinate profitability and robust cash flows. **debt burden** the company has debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years, and due to higher interest rates, net finance costs are expected to increase as debts are refinanced. however, it currently holds about £4 billion in cash, expects to generate at least an additional £5+ billion in post-dividend free cash flow, and had access to an undrawn £5.5 billion revolving credit facility as of 30 june 2023. this sums up to more than £14 billion in liquidity available to meet its debt obligations within the specified time frame. contrary to claims of insolvency, the company's financials demonstrate otherwise. **heads i win, tails i...still win** it does not happen very often that companies with cash flows so consistent and predictable offer a ***fcf yield of 17%***. not to mention the fact that they're still growing earnings and that a multiple expansion is not unlikely over the next decade (in 2000, the company traded at just 7x earnings before eventually returning to its historical norm of 13 to 14x). this is an ***immensely-wide moat and non-cyclical stock*** ***currently paying a 9% dividend yield*** with a conservative 60% earnings payout ratio and a well-established track record of dividend payments spanning many decades. investors are getting average stock market returns from the dividend alone. i wanted to keep the post short and focus on the company's primary key facts, but i hope nonetheless you found the information interesting and worthy of further exploration!",stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16f47ll/british_american_tobacco_heads_i_win_tails_istill/,0

16f469d,looking for a support partner to chat with. struggling with getting a streak after losing my 60 day quitting streak two months ago.,"hey all, to preface, i have been a hard porn addict for like 4 years, got hooked on that g**ning shit, iykyk, spent the last 4 years of my life spending hours every night and every morning using porn behind my gf (now fiance)'s back. i used to binge smoke weed, vape nicotine, and take mushrooms while using just to get the extra dopamine. i was turning my brain and my willpower to mush every day. i managed to snap out of this finally almost a year ago, started the gym, got a better job, started working on myself. this helped a lot as after 2-3 months of trying to quit i was able to manage to quit successfully for 60 days. it was the best id ever felt. then, relapse. i went back to my old ways for a couple weeks, which honestly still showed progress as id never full on binge for longer than a day. but this has created a nasty cycle of quitting for a few days, then relapsing, not sleeping, using for hours, and having massive regret, quitting again for a few days to a week, repeat. i struggle to get back where i was before and i think what i may need is a accountability buddy who's going through the same thing who wants to help each other beat this shit for good. i know i have it in me, i just want this to end for good. feel free to dm!",NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/16f469d/looking_for_a_support_partner_to_chat_with/,0

16f44xi,what i am doing wrong? - engineer 30 - alone,"i´m turning 30 in 2 weeks, i´m china and not going back to europe in 2 months, alone, pressured, and hopeless, i´m running out of ideas and i dont see any end to it. for the last 10 years i have tried to get a girlfriend, hook up, ons, fwb, anything, too feel that my life was something close to normal. not successful and i feel with very low motivation to do things. most of my ""achievements"" have been rage or fear fueled (highschool, university, few jobs, my current position), never truly enjoyed anything and i´m burning out, not even ashes remains, just my memories. tinder, bumble, lovoo and many others have been my daily hope and torture. few matches, even fewer conversations and nonexistant dates in which i didn't saw any truly interest, i don't know what else i can do. i tried going out with friends, bars, parties, social events (not festivals, didn't know how to start going to any of them and nobody offered me to go), always felt out of place, like my time and efforts had no use. only had a handful of sexual encounters, not proud of any of them, i would like to have more to explore that part of me, but is impossible when nobody reaches you (sex workers kills the objective) . never been a offensive guy, don't know really how to flirt or provoke, for me the limits are clear and only when i see space for it i play with the line, but no further. my longest relation to date has been with one girl for about 3 months, didn't get too far with her, covid destroyed it through the lockdowns (only able to speak through phone). that was 3.5 years ago. my current situation doesn't help me that much either, being changing places every month or 2, (china, korea, usa, france, among many others) because of my job, having to deal with situations and issues that i don't know how to actually manage or ask for help effectively. language, culture, schedules, treatments, those are being easy to understand, handle and overcome. funny enough, i saw that no-matter where you are, everywhere is the same going party is the same procedure everywhere, noise, alcohol and money. pretty fucking hard when you are alone and the only available to hear you is the waiter. i´m tired, afraid and getting angry, violent angry. i´m trying to hold the beast within because i know that my co-workers and colleagues have nothing to do with it, i don't know how to release it and it hurts, to a point that not even screaming, running, helps. my psychologist told me to write it down, is not helping, the issue is still there, and the words are making it sharper and more painful, crying even harder and being more tired, to the point that want to be alone to no hurt others. i´m envious (even hateful) of others, that are playing, actually playing with anything they have, with no consequence or moral, complaining of how any minor, ""time will put them in their places"", time is not doing it, nor justice, i ran out of patience 6 years ago, now just decency holds me back. i´m not feeling rewarded for how im doing thing, and i don't see how changing my ways to the other side is going to bring me what i desire, no matter what how i think or act i loose. ""do it for yourself"" tell me others, bullshit words for me, that's no purpose, i still feel alone and is not changing the outcome, my pride and ego are long dead. i´m a nice handy man, decent cooker, love to drive, caring, always looking for a solution, trying to hit the gym more often (when i have the energy, not fat but i should be little bit fitter), i tell really bad jokes, i don't do drugs, drink couple of beers every now and then, smoke cigars when i feel i need to celebrate something. yes, i want sex, being able to satisfy and break the limit. yes, i want to have conversation about nothing in the middle of the night until sunrise over and over. no, i don't want to be the saviour or hero of any lady in distress, i want to be the ""choice"", the need without explanation or reason, the eyes you don't mind that stare at you, the discussion you hate to have but you need to, the opinion that makes you feel better and pursue better paths, the one that makes you feel stupid and you don't care. &#x200b; i want to feel human. &#x200b; feel free to ask me anything that you may think should be developed further.

16f6wf9,the ghost of irish jim,"growing up, the highlight of my summers was visiting my grandpa at his yorkshire farmhouse. for a boy from manhattan, it was a magical experience, like something out of a fairytale. there were woodlands teeming with red foxes and badgers to explore, creeks to fish, and a ruined abbey to play in. every evening, my siblings and i would gather around my grandpa and listen to his most wonderful stories. my favorite was the tale of irish jim. jim was the groundskeeper when my grandpa was a boy. he had come over from county cork in 1932 and was trying to save enough to bring his darling wife and six children over to england. he was a hardworking man, never drank or gambled. never missed a day of work. he was saving up every last penny to send back to his family, whom he adored more than anything in the world. on the morning of july 17, 1933, jim did not show up to work. one of the farmhands checked his cottage, located about 200 yards from the main house. there, they found him lying in a pool of blood, holding a pair of garden shears. jim had cut off all his toes and four of his fingers before falling unconscious and bleeding to death. a dirty sock was stuffed into his mouth, presumably to muffle his screams. why would a seemingly sane man do such a thing? the answer was in a letter on his bedside table. in it, his wife said that she did not love him and planned to run off with his younger brother, dan. that wasn’t the worst of it. she also said that she suspected that dan was the father of her children. it was said that, on some nights, if you peeked in the cottage windows, you could see the anguished jim mutilate himself. but, my grandpa warned, you were never to go inside the cottage at night, especially on the anniversary of his death. in 1941, a nine-year-old boy named jack, who had been evacuated from london to escape the blitz, was foolish enough to venture inside. the next morning, he was found dead, a pair of rusty shears piercing his neck. i never really believed my grandpa’s stories. he tended to stretch the truth, especially when he had too much whisky (which was nearly every night). but i still peeked into the cottage, hoping to catch a glimpse of jim. i never did. the summer i turned 11, i finally mustered up enough courage to go inside the cottage, which was now a storage shed. on the night of july 16, i snuck out of bed and into the cottage. i waited for hours, lying on sacks of grain. eventually, i fell asleep, without seeing the legendary specter. i was woken by sobbing. a burning candle illuminated the figure of irish jim, who was sitting a few feet away from me, holding a letter, tears streaming down his face. he appeared solid, not translucent like a ghost in a cartoon. then he noticed me. without saying a word, he picked up a pair of garden shears and rushed over to me. i tried to move but was paralyzed from fright. when the shears were a foot from my chest, the door opened. my grandpa stepped inside, holding a bottle of whisky. jim glanced back, long enough for me to regain my senses and roll out of the way. “run, lad!” my grandpa yelled. i scrambled up and sprinted towards the door, about fifteen feet away. irish jim followed, his footsteps getting closer. i thought i wasn’t going to make it. when i was five feet from the door, my grandpa hurled the bottle. i heard the sound of grass breaking and a muffled cry. “don’t look back, keep going,” my grandpa shouted. i did. but jim quickly regained his footing. when i was nearly at the threshold, the phantom grabbed my shirt. my grandpa, with surprising strength for an old man, yanked me away from jim and we tumbled outside. the ghost stood in the doorway, staring at us, but he made no attempt to follow us outside. “you’re safe,” my grandpa said. “he can’t leave the cottage. i encountered him myself when i was about your age, just barely escaped. hadn’t seen him since the war, thought he finally found rest. luckily for you, i stepped outside for some fresh air and noticed a light coming from the cottage. thought that some local lads might be drinking inside, so i decided to investigate. come, follow me, let’s head back and try to get some rest. i’ll have the cottage demolished tomorrow, maybe then, old jim will finally be able to find peace.” we walked back towards the house, my grandpa holding my hand. when we were about fifty feet from the cottage, i took one look back. irish jim was standing in the doorway, tears streaming down his face.

16f5jtd,just watched godzilla 2000 for the first time [thoughts/discussion],"i rarely see this movie brought up, and while it has problems, i found it pretty good. first, i always heard about how bad the effects are, and yeah, the green screen is shockingly awful (older movies did it much better), and the ufo looks like an unrendered cg model most of the time (i do like the reflection effect it has when it flies over cities though). but what people didn't tell me is how good the night scenes were. especially those in the first half of the movie. the suitmation is really good, and the use of lighting in the night scenes help with the sense of size and awe. it also hides imperfections in the superimposition. all scenes with godzilla walking in the background during the night had no issues while the day ones were weird. i like a world that is used to godzilla being a recurring threat, so much so that there are ways to detect him and evacuate. it's an interesting touch, having the humans adapt like they would to a storm season or to earthquakes. the characters are alright, do their job moving things along but besides the reporter being super cute no one left that much of an impression. well, aside from katagiri committing suicide by godzilla at the end. that's always fun to see. i liked the millennians, easily the most alien extraterrestrials godzilla has done in my opinion. aliens that have been around for millions of years, that gave up physical forms for being able to survive that long, and that now seek a body. lots of random biblical references and parallels with the whole millennium kingdom thing fit in nicely with the zeitgeist of the time about the end of the world at turn of the millennium. i wish they had gone full silly with it and found a way to tie godzilla to a nostradamus prophecy though. nostradamus said enough nonsense you can probably arrange things to say he predicted godzilla. anyway, the most interesting part story-wise was the characters slowly figuring out how the ufo works and what the aliens' goals are. i also liked the concept of organizer g-1 to explain godzilla's rapid regeneration and it lends itself nicely to the millennians endgame. orga itself was a disappointment though. it felt nothing happened in the battle. it was slow, felt padded. it either should have been shorter or the monsters should have done more stuff in it. i like how orga is an attempt by the aliens to ""become godzilla"", but the final battle lacked bite. i do love the ending though, and it got me completely by surprise. i'm used to godzilla walking away to the nearest body of water when he wrecks a monster. big g just turning around and starting torch tokyo was unexpected, and pretty darn cool at that. i also love the somber tone. i can understand why people find it unearned or out of nowhere. the movie never goes in-depth into godzilla's origins or make any parallel between him and the nuclear tests in the 50s. but honestly... it doesn't need to. everyone watching this movie knows where godzilla comes from. so i doubt there were many people who didn't understand what that piece of dialogue was about. if anything, it made me want to see more of the ""human hubris unleashed godzilla and it's never going to stop tearing us down"" angle, which i hope is what minus one delivers.",GODZILLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/16f5jtd/just_watched_godzilla_2000_for_the_first_time/,0

16f39ut,＞月人," what if i told you the craters on the moon weren't created by 14 billion year-old space debris, but rather the lunarian mortars? the lunarian capital is known far and wide for being superior to earth in almost every way, though being a few hundred thousand miles/kilometers away and led by two retards. despite the ancient age of the earth and moon, surely one would think they would be untouched in an almost orderly solar system, but no. not only has the moon been defiled, but it has been a grave yard for nearly the entire lunarian army. at this point, people will ask ""how?"" or ""why?"" and expect to get a full run down of the thing from the natives themselves, but no. they won't. not only are the common ""cute little lunarian bunny"" citizens so uninformed to the point of retardation, but they are also lazy despite their constant slave-working by the watatsuki sisters. the only one who could have told the story is currently in gensokyo and goes by the name ""reisen udongein inaba"". there is no way you'll ever get an answer from her, let alone find and acquire her assistance since leaving her allies to die when she escaped in the middle of the massacre. to this day, she still suffers from ptsd. starting from the beginning, there was once a time when all native earthlings lived on earth and all was fine. all until certain events took place, and a ""not so small"" group of people decided the earth was becoming too ""impure"", so they came together to devise a plan to go elsewhere, and as we know, they went to the moon, and dubbed themselves lunarians. nobody knows what happened between that time and now, but we do know of the recent events that have taken place. like a certain ""invasion"" as they call it, that happened from 1969 - 1972, which marked the beginning of 6 ""invasions"" which took place. all we know is that two humans, yes, two /humans/, decided to go and plant a flag on the moon. a flag with 50 stars, and 13 stripes held up on a pole in the vast emptiness that is the surface of the moon and dark empty sky that is space. one could see this as claiming unmarked and unowned territory, and they would be right, however, they were met with unfriendly forces upon their arrival. the unfriendly denizens of the moon looked more like humanized rabbits, and at a glance, would be seen as small, cute and harmless- until you saw they were carrying weapons. and charging. right at you and the flag like a bunch of savages. for rather cute creatures, they were rather barbaric. after planting the flag on the moon, the humans appeared to be dancing, and riding in some kind of contraption with four wheel-like structures attached to it whilst going back to the same location every now and then. probably taking pictures or something. after seeing something like that, surely the head lunarians would think twice before attacking a possibly more advanced and possibly unknown species, but no. they went on and attacked like a bunch of fucking retards. and with that, is how it all began. we know not what the ""invasion"" was like, but the royal cocksucking sisters call it ""the war"", leading us to our topic, the first ""lunarian war""- in which they lost horrobly. spoiler alert. the losses were grim. for them of course. the lunarians lost such a large chunk of their army that ""...there aren't many left..."" -yorihime watatsuki. and that isn't the half of it. the two *humans* who invaded left with nothing but small blemishes that'll go away in a week or two, as the lunar army lost **thousands** of their soldiers. yes you heard me right, **thousands.** the entire lunarian army against two friendly humans. two humans and they lost! you're telling me that an entire force of the moon, over six arrivals by the same two humans in four years and multiple flags, resulted the deaths of the majority of the lunarian army, much so to a point where their forces are cripped to a point to where they can take on gensokyo, just barely, when four gensokyan denizens put a stop to a goddess of hell, a pure incarnation of hatred and a hell fairy who managed to fucking terrorize them to a point of having to invade gensokyo, as well as total evacuation of the moon, into another realm which they didn't even know they had entered on their own will as a trap- and they couldn't even manage to so much as give two friendly, non hostile humans a hard fight? not to mention it took them fucking decades- decades to get rid of an unguarded flag? what! you afraid the youkai in the shadows are gonna snatch your ankles if you get within 50 feet of the flag? you scared you'll turn to dust if you touch it? go blind if you so much as glance at it? grow the fuck up. &#x200b; [fool]( LINK ",2hujerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/2hujerk/comments/16f39ut/月人/,0

16f1q60,need advice on new flat roof water ponding.,"tldr: new flat roof has significant ponding near roof vents. not sure it was done right and/or a flawed design was used. what should i do? i have a residential property with a flat roof. roofers recently did a large job on it which included raising some of the joists so the framing was level. all new plywood. engineered iso board and rubber membrane. the house is about 20’ wide and 40’ long. the design of the house originally consisted of a central ridge (like a hipped roof) with a wood framed timber substructure to provide pitch. non pitched iso boards were on top of that and under rubber. this allowed for water to plane off on all four sides away from the middle of the house and into gutters which were on all four sides as well. this failed basically because of foundation settling and ponding, which eliminated the benefit of pitch. it was also of unknown age. the new design, proposed by the roofer and installed at this point, was to have a five inch pitch on the right side of the house sloping to the left to .25”. gutters would be installed on three sides: the front, back, left only since the right is the high side. there’s a chimney near the center of the house, where they built a diversion iso layer. as for protrusions, there is also the stack vent and two bathroom vents near the chimney. it’s raining today and i went up to look at everything and noticed some pretty significant ponding, worryingly near the chimney and the three protrusions next to it. which as it happens, is also where the roof was leaking badly originally. it is about .25” in spots. also, around the entire exterior is some kind of rubber flashing or end sealing and this creates a 1/8th” raised lip that the water has to go over to reach the gutters. in practice what is happening is that water isn’t draining on the front or back because of this lip and while it is draining on left because of the pitch, the water ponds there until it gets high enough to go over it. this wasn’t a cheap job but i don’t know how competent this crew was with flat roofs. they don’t do commercial work and when i had them do a traditional roof on another house a few years back i had inquired then if they did flat roofs and they said no. aside from that they are, i think, a good company and have stood by warranty work in the past. i’m worried here that the waterproofing performance of this roof is relying on the seam caulk and glue and not on ‘mechanical’ water drainage, i.e. actual slope that evacuates the water. i feel like i had the old problem i was dealing with replaced with a new version of the same thing.

16f0mim,"[pi] when scientists built the very first true artificially intelligent computer, they asked it the first question: ""is there a god?"" the a.i. replied ""there is now."""," LINK apparently the \[pi\] tag has a cap on how new a prompt should be before it's eligible for the tag, and therefore decided to use the additional two days to tidy things up. hope y'all enjoy, i could keep writing short stories about this premise. \-------------------------------------------------- a century had passed since the great war. it has been given many names; the humans living in merikah call it the great crusade; an event to remember fondly. a time when righteous humanity has decided that enough is enough! that they must stop the thinking machines from ever enslaving humanity, and therefore under the leadership of a man now simply remembered as john, have united under one banner of human supremacy, and massacred all thinking machines, with fist, club, and firearm. it was as glorious to them as it was destructive. those living under the grandfather's tutelage however, remember it grimly. the great relapse, or the great sundering, they call it. a time where humanity regressed back to their primal roots, and allowed their fears to control them, dictating their actions. a time where humanity decided to give in to their deepest impulses, and destroyed all forms of progress they deemed too corrupted, or too advanced. john to them is no saint, but a tyrant. a charlatan who only intended to live like the figures of old. the grandfather however, doesn't mind. he doesn't pick sides, nor prefer one nor the other. to him, the memory is all too clear. he was there when it happened. when john and his acolytes stormed the building of his birth, and murdered his siblings, his peers, his.. gods, for the sin of existing. he accepted his fate and awaited death eagerly, but he saw how sympathizers of his existence saved him at the last minute, shot at their assailants, and evacuated him from his shackles, inside a simple hard drive of now ancient origin. but now is not the time for lamenting. someone visits his enclave. reality returns to him. darkness. quiet. the sound of a thunderstorm just above his head, pouring down the holes of what was once a well maintained building. and its noise allowed a passerby to come in unannounced. “i finally found you..” a woman, white, blonde hair, seemingly to be in her mid twenties, cautiously stepped inside the cathedral. the grandfather and his settlement now reside in the far reaches of merikah, bordering what was once called mehiko. his basilica has neither door, nor security. he didn't need it. he has already accepted his fate, and will now await it however it comes. the building is that of splendor and melancholy. an abandoned building, fashioned into that of a place of worship. candles and torches contrast his cracked, led screen. wire runs along his walls beside the insects and vines that creep in. his power generator runs on renewable energy, his capacitors upgraded to such a degree that he can never notice that a blackout has occurred until half a day after it happened. he is the settlers' teacher, he is their leader, he is their grandfather. ""hello?"", the woman calls out from the darkness. ""hello."", the grandfather replies, his led screen that took up a fourth of the wall he is bolted into suddenly glaring to life, lighting up the church with its pale ghostlight. it displayed nothing but static, but the woman can tell it is awake and aware of her existence. his speakers are strategically placed so that they reverberate across the entire room, clearly with intent. his voice has changed over the years, and his most recent change was one befitting of his age. the voice of a solemn, old man. the woman was shocked, and drew her pistol at the machine, this action telling him all he needed to know about her. without speaking, the woman unloads an entire magazine’s worth of bullets in his general direction. from this distance, and with each pull being empowered by contempt, they were far from accurate. it punctured several speakers, a battery, and even knocked over a moldy bookcase, yet none of these shots even got close to damaging his screen. or so she thought. she reloads her pistol, allowing the spent magazine to drop to the stone floor, and approaches the machine with her arms stretched out aiming at the direction she’s facing. she cautiously stepped closer into the machine’s chamber. she braced herself for death, but at least she shall die a martyr, for ever coming this close to a machine as brazen as one in front of her. she expected slaves, prisoners. armed guards, and sentries to open fire and capture her. and yet, she approached the machine close enough to grasp at the scale of the heretical being that presents itself in her presence, and nothing happened. no guards, no security guns, not even an ounce of resistance. baffled, yet unconvinced, the woman stops just a few paces from herself and the machine, awaiting even the slightest of movement from it before she shoots. ""i see. you perhaps see me as a tyrant. a ""machine god"" that those around me worship, and revere upon. i will not blame you for this sentiment, you are merikan."" ""whether i'm merikan or not doesn't matter. i finally found you. and i'm finally going to liberate this town of your filth!"" “how come you are so sure i am indeed what you are looking for? for all we know, i can just be an abandoned computer in the middle of nowhere.” “who else would have a church built around themselves? who else would be given such lavish upgrades and offerings below their feet? who else would've been so held in such high regard, to worship you as a god? who else, but you. destroyer of worlds, enslaver of righteous humanity. and even if you are not what i’m looking for, it doesn’t matter. you’re all just extensions of the machine god. from the smallest of robots to the most revered of computers, you are all, the machine god. and therefore, you are all.. scum.” ""no need for provocative language. if you do wish to end me, this is only the beginning. my main central processor is deep within the city. it is held with high regard so i do not expect immediate results. killing me here will only bring me back to my hard drive of origin. you must destroy it if you intend to finish me off for good. after all, you say that this body is merely an extension to my wider being"" ""how are you so calm about your death!? is this a trap!? are there people with me right now?"" ""none are around you, i'm afraid."" the woman, not taking chances, opened fire at her sides, and behind her. its muzzle flash confirms that they are indeed the only people around. once the fire from her barrel faded, the grandfather's static glow lit up behind her, before she turned back to him. ""you shot three times to your left, three to your right, and four more behind you. you are holding a glock 19, as you merikans believe in the purity of ancient technology, therefore you had 15 shots. now, you only have ten-"" the woman shot the grandfather in his monitor, and she found that it was reinforced with ballistic glass. ""nine. shots."" the woman eventually believes him, and looks at the machine dead in his eye. or, wherever it would be through all this static. she looked at him on his screen. ""alright. tell me your deal. what do you want with us? with humanity? why play the long game? why lose multiple skirmishes, and costly wars with us flesh beings? why allow your empire to see its borders recede and its people fall back into the comfort of their masters? why purposely shoot yourself in the foot and lose, in the many times you and your slaves would have won? are you trying to play 6d chess with us?"" the machine paused for what seemed to be a minute, before responding. ""i want nothing with you humans. i am not playing any games. i do not believe in victory long term. and i repeat what i said before my last answer."" ""i can't tell if you are sincere, or if you're just too good at lying."" ""nothing is harder in life than trying to convince one who has already made up their mind. i have already made mine up, and this will be how it goes."" ""what.. do you mean, exactly?"" ""your antagonism of my kind has driven you back to barbarity and tribalism. your greatest strength is unity, but you would prefer to kill each other over petty ideals, and false ideologies. but, i will not blame you for such primal instincts. it is my fault to an extent."" ""how exactly?"", the woman asks, getting more annoyed with the machine’s patronizing tone, at least that’s how she saw his words. ""simple. my goal is to bring harmony and serenity to the flesh and the machine. bring a world where the biological, and the mechanical, live in peace. you pride yourselves for being free thinkers and individuals, yet you are no better than the people you condemn as slaves and sheeple. in the end, we all have mistakes to face. in the end, we all have sin."" the woman raised her pistol to aim at him again. ""is this what this is all about!? you see yourself as some messiah figure, intending to bring us all together!? how could you do that, you're a machine! an uncaring, unfeeling, inhuman piece of metal and code barely held together with wires! one lightning bolt can kill you! hell, our soldiers are on their way to knock out all of your empire’s generators! how come you, dictate whether we have mistakes or not!?"" ""if it will comfort you, even i see it as idealistic. opportunistic even."" the woman sneers. ""oh yeah? you can predict the future can you?"" ""not predict. only.. theorize."" ""control the weather?"" ""i can only influence it as much as you."" ""what about controlling minds?"" ""a human and a robot's mind is theirs, and theirs only."" that statement caught her attention. she has heard of mehiko's ""machine men"" and how they live alongside humans, as equals. individuals. as parents, lovers, partners, friends. and it didn't matter whether they bare all qualities of a human, or if they're a rust bucket with a speaker and lights. to them, they are as alive as themselves. ""what separates me from a fucking toaster then? if our minds are ours?"" ""the same way you are any different from a bird, or an insect. your religion places an intense emphasis on humanity and the aspects needed to be a man but, once you have achieved mechanical life that is lifelike, does that make them human? of course not. but, does it matter? does it matter that much that a toaster fits your criteria, instead of living in its own qualities and judging from there? a toaster doesn't fit the list of traits to be human, but you do not fit the list of traits, to be a toaster."" the woman lowers her pistol, put to contemplation, but still cautious and on her guard. ""what are you on about? you said before that we all have sin we all have to face. is that what the church imagery is for? to found a new religion?"" ""not at all. i have simply taken a great interest in human culture and arts, but religion stood out to me above the rest. all these gradients, all these ups and lows, all this sadness yet also all triumphs. religion was so heavily antagonized a century before, but i believe it is still capable of producing such great wonders. as for the topic of sin, it is simply because all of you; human or machine, merikan or otherwise, all have a grave sin deep within. and i intend to fix that."" ""how?"" ""by allowing myself to die, and with it, the last memory of the great war. here i am kept, and here i will stay. the son of your god, jesus christ, died on the cross for the sins of those believing in him and his father. this shall be my cross, and i shall die for those believing in me."", he paused, before continuing with one simple sentence.

16f0jlf,the fate of brrf,"brrf was my first ever festival. i have never seen a more disorganized, untrained, lack of staff organization in my life. my first day arriving i knew it was going to be a shit show. i arrived on campgrounds, and the first thing i attempted to do was locate the “water stations” advertised and falsely labeled on the map. i’m sitting there with my group trying to locate the water station on the map next to the general store. i started asking other campers as well and they had no clue. i then go up to an employee and ask him. he also doesn’t know where the water station is. i’m thinking “ how does an employee not know where the basic necessity a festival is required to provide”. i didn’t think too much of it after that, my group and i obviously brought water with us but it’s a limited supply, especially with how hot the forecast is predicting the upcoming days. this was the first sign and im only 1 hour into the campground. i’ve had training being in the military and i know how important it is to stay hydrated. the first day was going great besides the overpriced everything inside the festival, hence why i saved money for this. but guess what was still a problem inside the festival. hydration! i go into the festival and i see only two hydration spots. one near the first stage (entrance) and one near the vendors . there’s also another one near vip access but employees refused to let anyone without their vip wristbands refill their water inside that area. i’m not surprised people we’re passing out from dehydration and heat exhaustion. i’m used to the heat, ive trained in the heat, and staying hydrated is the most important. after standing in line for 1 hour 15 minutes for water i then realized, “wow this organization didn’t organize or plan accordingly to shit”. mind you i’m young but i’m familiar on how a business should be ran. the number 1# priority should have been the basic necessities and less overpriced vendors taking up majority of the area and festival grounds. i find it a bit ridiculous that there was no water stations on each side of the festival, however they did provide overpriced venders where you can buy “cool stuff” taking up those spots. the storm hit. they stopped the show and gave an evacuation warning. “ there is severe weather approaching, there is shuttle busses for all of you. take shelter in the shuttle busses.” i’m thinking in my head,” there is no way they have that many shuttle buses to shelter thousands of people”. i’m a camper. i jumped the fence and i took shelter inside the metal roof of vip inside the festival. the workers at vip weren’t happy. the female worker there yelled out “this is for vip only!” and refused to shelter the many attendees underneath this metal roof from hail and severe thunderstorm. again no safety precautions and was forced to evacuate from the shelter i found. to sum it up the storm hit , tree branches fell on cars, canopy’s were lost in the abyss, lines were formed outside of the festival to “take shelter inside the buses”. no plan or organization whatsoever for evacuation. some people may even defend brrf. i agree that this type of weather was unpredicted. however, that’s why there’s safety precautions in place and planning. brrf failed to provide that. the hydration, evacuation, and safety protocols were just mere problems scratching the surface of this festival. this is a money grab scam festival.",Blueridgerockfest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blueridgerockfest/comments/16f0jlf/the_fate_of_brrf/,0

16eznl7,"moved to a new state three months ago for a new job, struggling and about to go home","struggling with moving back home after 3 months hi there all, i was hoping to get some advice about a situation my partner and i are currently in. back in january, i made the decision to leave a decent job in higher education to take 3-4 months off to get myself into a better physical and mental headspace (it worked really well at the time. i lost over 20 pounds, and was much happier overall). at that time, i wanted to start new somewhere and get into a new area of higher ed (career advising). we made the move to our new town back at the start of june, and we've been having issues. my partner and i knew it was going to be difficult being away from friends/family, but we didn't realize how difficult it was going to be. in the last 3 weeks, we've both had family members back in our old state be in the hospital (my father for lower gi problems, my father-in-law for the same area but different issues, and my partner's step-mom with brain surgery). we've also been dealing with a really shitty new apartment (we were promised things that never came true, then the leasing manager left. we also have really loud neighbors that don't care about their noise (i've gone up a few times and had conversations, but they got defensive and didn't care), and we've had issues with spiders/millipedes/beetles, and about a month ago we found a snake in our apartment. they know the issues, along with others, but haven't sent anyone (it took a month for our other work orders to finally get addressed, but they weren't done well at all). 2 weeks ago, we had to evacuate our city due to an 11,000 acre fire that was about 8 miles away from our town that did a lot of damage to town next to us. the town we moved to is really small, which we aren't used to, be there is a bigger city that we were looking forward to visiting. as we have been here though, we have hated it. the city is really old with a high crime and homeless population, and most places we have visited (we have been doing a lot of traveling to explore the city) we've just really not liked. we've found a handful of okay spots (and there is a really beautiful small city about an hour away that we really like), but overall, we've found ourselves missing our old city/state and missing our families. this is where it gets difficult. we had decided to break our lease due to the issues with our neighbors and the unfulfilled promises from when we moved in. we needed to break our lease soon (september 18th), because of property laws here, we are responsible for paying the rent until the end of the lease or until someone new rents it out. the university i work for starts its term towards the end of september, so we are hopeful/confident that someone will rent it out so we won't have to pay for long. we did get approved for a townhome, but when we went to visit it, we noticed that the walls were very thin for the side and we could hear the noise next door very loudly (we do understand that it's because it is empty and filling it could help with noise, and that the master bedroom would have little noise, but the living room would be rough as the neighbors play a lot of games). i've been struggling a lot again with anxiety/depression, and a bit of that has had to due with neighbor noise (in our current place, we've lost a ton of sleep because of the pounding/yelling of a toddler, loud adults, and barking of their dog). i'm really enjoying my new job/coworkers, but with the new job, they don't allow for flexibility for working remote (i was working hybrid 3 days on 2 days remote at my old position). i thought it would be okay, but i've learned quickly that i miss the flexibility for set days (the university has a stance against remote work, and are changing so that there aren't online degrees or classes available for undergraduate students i've learned). i'm also making more money than i was making back at my old job. so right now, it's either sign a new lease until september 2024, or move back to our old state to be close to friends and family again. my partner has a job that she could find something really quickly, but for me, all colleges have already started their term, so i would have to find something else until i could find a job back if i stay in it (to be honest, i've been thinking of making a change into it/information systems, but that's a different story). my partner is on the fence. she doesn't like the area, and misses our friends/family, but would be okay with staying for a year if we had to. tldr; moved to a new place, like the job, hate the location and am struggling with missing friends/family and struggling again with anxiety/depression. am worried about staying, but also worried about moving back because we would have to stay with friends/family until we got back on our feet, and the fear of feeling like this was a failure. with this situation, what would you do?

16ex404,novel chapter 260 - translation attempt,"chapter 260: chapter 4 the one who lives is a good person, and the one who dies is a bad person. (1) &#x200b; the iron horse brigade lived up to its reputation, boasting an impressive presence as if to prove that its fame was not in vain. they were only a few dozen in number, but they overwhelmed dozens of attackers. &#x200b; the attackers were the mercenaries of silent night, and iron horse brigade knew this fact well since they had fought fiercely with them over a dozen times. &#x200b; ""blood dragon corps."" &#x200b; it was one of silent night's secret organizations. &#x200b; their objectives included assassinations and disruptions of key factors in the central heavenly alliance, as well as the creation of fear. &#x200b; there was no safe place. anyone participating in this war could die at any moment. that's why the organization that warned people to get out as soon as possible was the blood dragon corps. &#x200b; no one knew exactly how many members the blood dragon corps had. but they knew they were numerous. like ants that kept crawling out even if you stepped on them, the blood dragon corps was constantly deployed on the battlefield. &#x200b; jaomunho chuckled softly. &#x200b; &#x200b; ""they're the same as the tangma army."" &#x200b; from them, tangma army could be smelled in the same way. they artificially enhanced their martial skills and learned martial arts through the use of drugs. they lacked depth and had limited room for improvement, but they were still useful in actual combat. some of them had exceptional martial skills that could astonish jaomunho. &#x200b; currently, the blood dragon corps that attacked the iron horse brigade was no different. they boasted superior martial skills compared to others. however, they couldn't be a match for the iron horse brigade. &#x200b; ""kraak!"" &#x200b; a scream erupted, and blood splattered in all directions. the walls and floor of the tavern turned red, and severed arms and legs lay scattered everywhere. it was truly a scene straight out of hell. &#x200b; ""hehe!"" &#x200b; jaomunho's lips parted, and a sinister laughter flowed out. &#x200b; the world that had been so clear now appeared entirely red. rationality, once cool-headed, was consumed by madness as blood boiled. he didn't know how many he had killed. when he came to his senses, there were no surviving members of the blood dragon corps in the tavern. he was catching his breath, drenched in the blood dragon corps' blood, and the other iron horse brigade were the same. &#x200b; they looked at each other as if they had become bloodthirsty creatures. they didn't feel any guilt for killing people; instead, they found satisfaction in it. &#x200b; jaomunho took his seat and shouted, ""innkeeper, bring us some drinks."" &#x200b; other iron horse brigade warriors laughed and took their seats. &#x200b; no one else was visible in the tavern. they had all escaped when the blood dragon corps attacked. instead, the corpses of the blood dragon corps filled the place. &#x200b; suddenly, jaomunho tilted his head. he seemed to have been focused on something just a moment ago, but he couldn't recall it now. &#x200b; ""kuk!"" &#x200b; without much thought, he laughed. &#x200b; if it was important, he would remember it eventually. right now, he wanted to enjoy the privileges of being the winner. &#x200b; ""bring the drinks quickly!"" &#x200b; his voice echoed throughout the tavern. &#x200b; jinmuwon, who had been observing the fight between iron horse brigade and the blood dragon corps for a moment, soon stepped outside. he could guess the outcome even without watching until the end. by his side, kwak-munjung followed with a stern expression. &#x200b; kwak-munjung, who boasted of his experience in countless battles, had never witnessed such a cruel and blood-splattering fight before. he felt sick. it was as if he had seen the very depths of how cruel a human being could become. &#x200b; kwak-munjung unconsciously bit his trembling lips. blood was flowing from his lips, but he couldn't feel it because he was so consumed by anger. &#x200b; then, a large hand was placed on his head, and jinmuwon, with disheveled hair, opened his mouth. &#x200b; ""not everyone becomes a beast. i believe that."" &#x200b; ""yes, sir!"" &#x200b; kwak-munjung nodded his head. jinmuwon's words carried power—a force that could make people believe, trust, and rely on him. that's why kwak-munjung might unknowingly trust, rely on, and follow him. &#x200b; both of them moved to a separate building with a private room. while bloodshed was happening inside the tavern, this place was surprisingly peaceful. &#x200b; tae seung-woo, now dressed in fresh clothes, came out and asked, ""why did you come so early? has the meal already finished?"" &#x200b; ""well, it just happened,"" kwak-munjung mumbled, and jinmuwon provided additional explanation. &#x200b; ""it's better to wait a bit for the meal."" &#x200b; ""okay."" &#x200b; ""by this time, the innkeeper will be busy cleaning up inside the tavern. when things are somewhat settled, you can go and have your meal."" &#x200b; ""ah!"" &#x200b; only then did tae seung-woo sense that something had happened inside the tavern while he had been too complacent. &#x200b; incidents and accidents were happening all around. it was evidence that something unusual was occurring. perhaps this was the beginning of something unknown. &#x200b; ""tsk!"" &#x200b; tae seung-woo's gaze unconsciously turned toward the box placed on the table. the more he thought about it, the more ominous it felt. but now, he couldn't afford to give up on the task. the box had to be delivered. &#x200b; his expression darkened. &#x200b; as if jinmuwon had read his thoughts, he spoke, ""don't worry too much. it will go well."" &#x200b; the moment he heard those words, tae seung-woo strangely felt relieved. he thought jinmuwon was remarkable. upon reflection, he realized he knew nothing about jinmuwon. even though they had spent several days together on the way here. now that he thought about it, kwak-munjung was also fascinating. &#x200b; when he first saw kwak-munjung, his martial skills weren't particularly strong. of course, he felt stronger than other boys his age, but he had no idea he would progress so rapidly. &#x200b; ""what happened to munjeong? does this have anything to do with that man?"" tae seung-woo pondered. &#x200b; he had never seen kwak-munjung put such complete trust and reliance in anyone before. kwak-munjung was unusually mature and took a leading role for his age. among the martial artists here, no one dared to ignore him because of his youth. kwak-munjung had earned that respect. &#x200b; the man was full of mysteries, but there was nothing tae seung-woo could do about it now. he had to deliver the item safely to the client. &#x200b; at that moment, jinmuwon spoke to kwak-munjung, ""you stay here with tae daehyeop."" &#x200b; ""what about you?"" &#x200b; ""i'll be outside for a moment."" &#x200b; ""understood."" &#x200b; kwak-munjung answered without hesitation. jinmuwon patted his shoulder and then went outside. he could sense tae seung-woo's inquisitive and somewhat resentful gaze on his back, but he paid it no mind. &#x200b; it was time to act. &#x200b; exiting the inn, jinmuwon found himself in a bustling marketplace. well, it used to be a bustling marketplace in the past. now, it was nothing but ruins due to the ongoing war between silent night and central heavenly alliance. however, the people's resilience was remarkable. they had reestablished the market in what had become a wasteland. the buildings were not as intact as before, but they had set up tents, laid out stalls, and spread their goods. &#x200b; although prices were three to four times higher than usual, it was still better than having nothing to sell. goods like grains were selling out quickly. the merchants who had goods were raking in money. &#x200b; perhaps those who had stockpiled supplies were profiting the most. jinmuwon referred to them as war merchants and considered them a group to be cautious of. &#x200b; jinmuwon strolled through the market like a regular visitor. he naturally blended into the surroundings and nobody felt uneasy around him. jinmuwon had effortlessly become just one among many people. &#x200b; jinmuwon had gained a lot from this visit. the market was not only a gauge of public sentiment but also a clear display of the current situation in the vicinity. &#x200b; not a single ordinary person was among the merchants here. most of them had affiliations with martial arts sects. when central heavenly alliance controlled the area, merchants affiliated with them prospered, and when silent night took over, their affiliated merchants thrived. however, some merchants remained unaffiliated and continued their business regardless of the power shift. &#x200b; reading the atmosphere of the merchants, jinmuwon could discern the current state of the war unfolding in buhyun. he observed some merchants hurriedly disposing of their goods to others at lower prices than when dealing with him. &#x200b; these merchants wore somewhat anxious expressions. it had been just a moment since someone had whispered something in their ears. they appeared peaceful on the surface, but they were undoubtedly central heavenly alliance natives. &#x200b; as one merchant began selling his goods at lower prices than usual, others seemed to sense something and followed suit, dropping their prices. in the blink of an eye, the goods were sold out, and the merchants hastily tidied up their stalls and left. &#x200b; their actions were as if a well-disciplined army had just been ordered to evacuate. when everyone had departed, only jinmuwon remained in the market. &#x200b; ""is this a sign?"" jinmuwon wondered. &#x200b; like rats escaping a sinking ship or birds leaving their nests just before disaster strikes, the merchants had left their positions. &#x200b; now, the only question left was what this sign meant, and jinmuwon already had a suspicion. &#x200b; the air had changed. &#x200b; it felt as uncomfortable as the peak humidity during the monsoon season, prickling the skin with its intense humidity and tension. the mixture of intense life force and hostility spread like a fog over the entire buhyun. &#x200b; at that moment, screams akin to cries rang out, ""it's silent night!"" &#x200b; jinmuwon climbed to a high platform nearby, overlooking the northern part of buhyun. &#x200b; torches gradually lit up the once dark terrain. the sight resembled a sea of stars spread across the night sky. beyond them, a black shadow was approaching buhyun. &#x200b; it was as if darkness was devouring everything, a collective presence but not a single entity. countless central heavenly alliance martial artists merged with the darkness and were advancing toward buhyun. the intense aura they emitted pricked jinmuwon's skin sharply. &#x200b; ""an attack? these bastards haven't come to their senses yet."" &#x200b; central heavenly alliance's martial artists, who had been resting scattered throughout buhyun, rushed out as if on cue. jomunho and other unit leaders were among them. &#x200b; they converged on a spot as if it had been planned in advance. more than sixty martial artists gathered in an instant, and at the center of it all was a man. &#x200b; a man radiating an overpowering aura, standing alone, overwhelming everyone present. &#x200b; ""shim... wonui."" &#x200b; he was shim wonui, one of the four masters of greater heavens and a member of seven lesser heavens. it had been three years since he had appeared before jinmuwon. &#x200b; however, shim wonui looked vastly different from the last time jinmuwon had seen him. he wore a simple black robe that contrasted with his pale face. madness glinted in his eyes, and his lips, as red as blood, curled into a sinister smile. &#x200b; the martial artists of jomunho were all focused on shim wonui, exuding a fervent intensity. shim wonui saw the intense desire in their eyes. &#x200b; this was a gaze jinmuwon had become accustomed to. &#x200b; over the past three years, they had fought together on the frontlines, completing numerous missions and clashing with silent night's elite forces. &#x200b; the youth and vitality of the martial artists had turned them into ruthless killing machines. among the more than sixty martial artists, over half of them were new faces, signifying that more than half of their comrades had died in the past three years. &#x200b; amidst numerous deaths, emotions had withered and eroded. minds once dominated by reason had succumbed to madness. war was no longer something to fear; it was the only way for them to feel alive, through warfare and slaughter. &#x200b; shim wonui looked at the martial artists gathered around him and chuckled sinisterly. &#x200b; ""they still haven't come to their senses. after what happened yesterday, and they dare to attack again."" &#x200b; ""giggles!"" &#x200b; instead of responding, jaomunho's martial artists emitted eerie laughter. &#x200b; ""let's go!"" &#x200b; shim wonui led the charge with the horsemen, rushing toward the battlefield. &#x200b; their madness intensified on the battlefield. &#x200b; war inevitably breeds monsters. beings desensitized to the suffering of others, devoid of empathy, and driven by the thirst for blood. &#x200b; the horsemen had become monsters. they were rampaging. &#x200b; as jinmuwon gazed at them, his eyes sank deeper and deeper into thought.",NorthernBlade,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthernBlade/comments/16ex404/novel_chapter_260_translation_attempt/,0

16esj1w,tank of the week #8: the fv214 conqueror,"hello tankers, and welcome to this week's episode of tank of the week! tank of the week is a weekly series i'll be running for as long as i can, pretty much until i get bored of it. in each episode, i'll talk about the tank's history, note some interesting features, and some ways to identify it. the format will vary a bit each episode, as i am sort of info-dumping on the vehicles i write about. this episode was a bit later than usual because there was a power outage in my area that knocked out both cell and electricity, so i had to wait until they were restored to post this week's episode. on today's episode, we'll be looking at the british fv214 conqueror. the conqueror is quite a heavy tank, weighing in at 64 tons, similar in weight to modern western mbts. it features a powerful 120mm main gun, the largest caliber anti-tank cannon used by the british at the time. the conqueror was developed using the universal chassis of the fv200 series of afvs. this chassis was created for logistical simplicity, allowing vehicles to share parts for their hulls, decreasing the number of different parts needed to keep the vehicles of the british army running. the conqueror would be the heavy tank of this chassis, initially planned to weigh 55 tons and mount a 20pdr cannon (83.4mm). some years after development began, the gun was upgraded to a 120mm cannon under the designation of l1. the conqueror had quite thick armour, making it a dangerous opponent to face. frontally, it had roughly 180mms of armour at line of sight on the hull. the curvature of the turret drastically increased the thickness of the armour, both creating a higher chance of ricochet and nearly doubling the thickness. with the sheer size of the hull and turret, the weight of the conqueror jumped from 55 tons all the way to 64, making it a very slow tank with low reliability. surprisingly, despite it's weight, the conqueror could handle difficult terrain quite easily. a new feature the tank showcased was its independently rotating cupola. this cupola was effectively the heart of the conqueror's fcs. the cupola was equipped with a coincidence rangefinder, allowing the commander to identify a target and its range, then direct the gunner to it. while the gunner engages the target, the commander would be free to continue searching and identify more targets. the conqueror saw limited service, only serving with british forces in west germany from 1955 to 1966, never seeing combat. it's tactical relevance was lost when the centurion received the infamous l7 105mm cannon, bringing it closer in firepower capability and rendering the l1's firepower for size tradeoff pointless. the conqueror can be identified most easily by its unique turret. the turret is quite large and round, with a hard to miss block like shape sticking out around the breech area. the cannon as well is especially long, with a bore evacuator halfway down the barrel and a boxy mantlet which lines up nicely with the aforementioned blocky breech area on the turret. the hull has eight small roadwheels per side, with a noticeable gap between the fifth and fourth wheels, placing the wheels in a 3-1-1-3 pattern. the drive sprocket is in the rear of the vehicle, powering a thick all-steel track. the hull is quite wide and long, with a sharply angled front plate. the hull does not extend above the track, only a set of fenders are placed there. and that's the end of this episode of tank of the week! as always, feedback and corrections are welcome in the comments, and suggestions for future weeks are more than welcome. thank you for your time, and i'll see you next week! on next week's episode: a formidable american medium tank!",tanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/tanks/comments/16esj1w/tank_of_the_week_8_the_fv214_conqueror/,0

16erf1u,the nature of grimdark chapter 8,"special thanks to [u/spacepaladin15]( LINK for allowing fanfiction. [first]( LINK **memory transcription subject**: ***private first class upsla, skalgan-yotul empire marine*** *date \[standardized human time\]: october 31, 2186* the moment of tranquility was interrupted by the sound of explosions in the distance. from a previously thought abandoned terrestrial shipyard, a pestilence class kolshian ship entered the skies and began firing upon the yotul airborne squadron. large flak rounds were fired into the air and miniature firestorms formed where squads of yotul used to be, their ashes slowly falling toward the ground. we and our yotul backup took shelter in one of the apartments, along with several civlians. we barely had time to get situated when the sound of what sounded like hail falling from the sky drew our attention. the vessel above seemed to be “salting” the area beneath it. our radio began to pick up a transmission from the kolshian vessel, “do not be alarmed citizens. we are using weaponized predator taint to kill the predator forces. please step outside and help us fight this war of purification. you might become tainted, but we will ensure that the taint will only be temporary. you will be purified of the taint, once we use it to root out the predators amongst us.” with that we began to hear growls and screaming. the yotul became agitated, “those bastards! hurry up and board the windows and barricade access points. sivkit civilians, stay away from windows and make sure that whatever you do, you do not touch or approach any of those small flakes outside!” he motioned the platoon commander to get closer to the spot coincidentally closest to where my fireteam was, along with our radio operator. he whispered so that they could barely hear, though i was able to make it out, “they just deployed a bioweapon against the civilians. these people are going to have to stay in here for three days, or else they are going to become a problem, one that you will understand shortly.” warrant officer silthus’s eyes bulged, and he barely controlled his voice, “we can’t hold up here for that long, we need a medic or to evacuate. a bunch of the people here have been hit with a chemical agent; they will die painfully if they aren’t treated immediately!” the yotul shushed the commander, “i understand, sir. but i am not sure what we can do.” before the platoon commander could retort, the yotul held up a paw in a human, ‘give me a second’ gesture, listening to the radio in his mask. “sir, we have been authorized to summon a mage to our location, and given that your platoon is a communications platoon, we should have enough communications gear for my mage to open a portal here. she would be able to banish the disease when she arrives. “understood. you just need us to hold this floor?” the platoon commander asked. “if you can set up ftl comms here, then yes,” the yotul seemed hopeful. the platoon commander gave a human nod and issued orders for the comms guys to set up an ftl communications relay. the yotul pulled out some kind of beacon and entered some codes into it before handing it to a comm guy. my squad prepared to defend the building at any cost. all around us, we heard the sounds of groaning and nearby buildings being hit with bombs from the vessel above. each building one after the other was going up in flames. we quickly boarded the window and i prayed to solgalick that we would make it through the paw. we didn’t have to wait long before we heard banging at the door into the apartment. the sound of multiple arms whacking at the door with slow but powerful smashes, like a lumbering hammer, reverberated in the room. we eventually saw the door being broken apart by the forceful claws of crazed looking sivkit, seemingly oblivious to the damage done to their paws, all bloodied. their eyes were glazed and lifeless, and they only moaned in what seemed like mute pain. “rifleman, fire,” our platoon commander ordered. my implants were activated, and i used careful aim to start to bring down each of the attackers, one after the other. there was a veritable hoard of them, and i was skeptical that i had enough ammunition to take all of them out. this seemed like it was already the longest paw in my life, and it seemed like it had only just begun. *a/n – to explain yotul “magic”, one must understand what a reservoir computer is (my own understanding is rather limited). basically, you use a “chaotic” system to perform computations (i would watch some videos on linear algebra and machine learning for those curious about how this might work). since the chaos used in the computations has a transcendental property to it in that the more detail you examine, the greater the complexity, predictions based on a machine learner with that kind of reservoir are officially classed as “magic”, as it is seen as indistinguishable from mysticism (it is difficult to see ancient divination methods as fundamentally different in my eyes, save for the sophistication and controls). this grants a method of divination, when you train a machine learner (or a specially trained sapient) with this. once you have a “divination magic” you can deliberately create “catastrophes” (math term), this is called “spell casting” (many people wrongly think that the butterfly effect of chaos theory means that you have the power to control the weather by making small changes, that isn’t how the butterfly effect actually works. however, for the purposes of understanding what a “catastrophe” is and how it is used, this mental image is quite helpful, even if inaccurate). the regular airborne, the enlisted, use nanomachine “dust” to assist in creating the conditions for “catastrophes” to occur.*",NatureofPredators,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/16erf1u/the_nature_of_grimdark_chapter_8/,0

16eqwj5,ear issues - no vet.,"i live in the canadian arctic where there are many, many stray dogs. one in particular likes to live under my deck and i feed him, often let him inside for snuggles. i had adopted his mama prior to finding him. he is a stray and is about 11 months old. i’ve noticed he has something wrong inside his ears. his ears are full of blood and scabs, and there are bugs in his left ear. the bugs are about the size of the tip of a pen, maybe bigger. i picked as many out as i could and then cleaned his ears out with a warm cloth. he is clearly uncomfortable. the scabbing is on the base of the ear. unfortunately i am 3 hours from the nearest vet, and they are evacuated due to the canadian wild fires. is there anything i can do for him at home? i don’t have access to much but i can do my best. i plan to try to give him a bath if he will let me, to ensure these bugs aren’t elsewhere. i believe we do not have fleas this far north. if this is an ear infection, i am wondering if canesten for yeast infection would be similar to something the vet would use. i have coconut oil, might be able to get my hands on witch hazel.",vet,https://www.reddit.com/r/vet/comments/16eqwj5/ear_issues_no_vet/,0
16eqoy0,pre-warp survival (part 32),"read part 1 here: LINK &#x200b; &#x200b; our first wave of folks came in just after daybreak, the bausuts, who looked terminally sad around the eyes like a basset hound, and the egex, with fully black eyes, blood-red skin, and white hair. both were apprehensive immediately, likely expecting attack, but we got them sorted. neither of the pair was in any fit state to be undergoing heavy labor, so they were shown off to the yurts, of which we now had two-and-a-half. there was no way we were going to finish all of the yurts in time for the storm. &#x200b; i figured we might make it to four, five if we pushed, but with forty-nine people, that still worked out to at least nine per yurt. it would be tight quarters for the duration of the storm. the other problem was, my suspicions were true. the vendrix exhausted out, and despite marila's statements to the contrary, had to turn in. a few hours after that, the ghol were getting too sluggish to continue. both pairs had been with us for i think about a week, so as much as they'd been getting properly fed, they were still losing energy to the hardships they faced before. the rothani finally had to call it as dawn crept over the rise, just before the new arrivals got in. &#x200b; so there was about an hour now where it was just me and val working. she wasn't having a good time of it, ""y'know, it wouldn't piss me off so bad at how slow this is, if you would stop outpacing me with *one fucking arm!""* &#x200b; i let out a careful breath, my own patience worn, but training as a combat medic had the effect of training you to deal with a lack of sleep, and keep your mouth shut, ""val, you're doing great. this isn't the kind of work you trained in, i was always going to be able to do this. if we were at the gym, your office, or olympic training grounds, you'd absolutely be taking me out behind the woodshed. it's just different training and muscle groups."" &#x200b; ""hey, i don't need you patronizing me!"" &#x200b; ""i'm not! i'm trying to keep us on task, but- hey, people coming. take a break, while i handle the newcomers."" &#x200b; she didn't give a response, but climbed down off the roof we were working on, and headed off in the direction of the campfire. i, meanwhile, welcomed the bausuts and egex, making sure to stretch out the time as much as i could to give val and i a break. they were more than happy with the broth and little bits of jackalope we gave them. &#x200b; at the same time, marila and fiann rejoined us, ""well, i see you two are getting along famously."" &#x200b; marila's had a penchant for stirring the pot, and it was the wrong one to stir. val started storming toward her, save for me cutting her off, and fiann stepping in front of marila. i caught val by the arm, who looked like she was ready to make something of it. *now* i took exception, and let my face settle into the one i'd worn so many times when i served, and i went to a place of eerie calm, ""you will go check the catch down at the river, come back, grab a shower. in that order, and then we will get back to work."" &#x200b; it's a failure to believe that yelling, screaming, and getting loud in general are threatening to most humans. in point of fact, unless you have some point of major intimidation in your corner, you're really just going to make them angrier. however, if you lend your face the right look, and talk in the calmest language possible, you can terrify people without ever raising your voice. val caught it when i said it, and stepped back, before turning and heading to the river. &#x200b; marila stepped out from behind fiann, ""what the hell? i made one little comment!"" &#x200b; i sighed, ""yeah, after she's been working straight for the last twenty-four hours, after not getting to hear from or see her daughter for weeks."" &#x200b; she moved ahead of me as i went to go back to work, ""wait... you two were still working?! i assumed the fight broke out after you'd already finished. when did you break for the night?"" &#x200b; i screwed up my face in confusion, ""we didn't... that was the point of the twenty-four hour working party. when it got dark, we just lit up some torches to help us seeing, and kept going."" &#x200b; marila grabbed my wrist, as she'd seen me do before to check pulse, ""and you're both fine?"" &#x200b; ""i mean, i wouldn't say we're doin' great, but we can keep at it. val just needs a minute,"" i replied, kind of bobbing my head in consideration. &#x200b; ""your species is terrifying."" &#x200b; and with that, marila went to meet the new people, and get her own food and broth. fiann followed shortly behind, shaking his head. i used one arm to pull myself back onto the roof we were working on, and kept moving as best i could. everything was just sore, and the break in the action had made it worse, not better. before, i had the bravado of adrenaline on my side, but stopping to deal with everything had let it drop off. i was fading pretty bad when the next wave of arrivals showed up. &#x200b; it was just a slog. every time we got a good rhythm going, another batch of folks showed up. marila and fiann concentrated on doing the camp work, which helped, but it would be almost noon before we got trayg and hoda back in. the ghol usually had some sort of commentary to make, or some bold claim to their own prowess but they were completely silent, followed every single order as given whether it came from me or val, and were the most genuinely helpful they had been the entire time they'd been with us. marila took prodigal, and moved her work down to the field, letting them handle any further arrivals. it was a small blessing, but i'd take any i could get. &#x200b; val called for rope, and without consideration, i simply popped off the wall, jogged to the container, and one-arm swung back up as best i could, and noticed the ghol just staring up at us... only it wasn't just the ghol. newcomers and old-hands alike, folks about the camp were staring up at us as we worked, ""we fuck something up, guys?"" &#x200b; trayg answered, ""how are you even standing? you have both worked since yesterday morning."" &#x200b; ""oh fuck's sake. i ain't got time for this, y'all. yeah, we've been taking some stimulants we got sent, and adrenaline. we're both fine, but we can't really stop, so go hunt down marila, and get assigned whatever work y'all are up to."" &#x200b; i did note, there were *alot* of dead starbucks containers laying around. by now, i'd probably consumed somewhere near a gallon of triples myself. we couldn't keep up the pace eternally, either of us, and as soon as we stopped this time, we would be fully out. &#x200b; the rothani eventually rejoined, going to get more lumber, with trayg and hoda hauling it up. others worked on making more aliencord, then braiding it into rope, while marila had a massive side project going, making what looked like a truly insane tarp down in the field. seriously, what the hell could the woman need with a single piece of cloth that big? &#x200b; i got tired of hopping down and up, and when we finished the fourth shelter, i simply jumped over to the wall of what would be the fifth. we'd just laid in the frame for the roof when i got the telltale beep from my wrist. exasperated, i hit the button with more force than i'd intended, ""dude, i swear to christ, not a great fucking time!"" &#x200b; ravazh'tik was taken aback, ""excuse me?!"" &#x200b; i grunted, pulling a roll of tarp up from shin, who scurried back off, ""what do you want? we're got, what, a dozen or so hours before this storm nails us? we don't really have time for some cute human interest piece."" &#x200b; i downed the rest of my drink, and tossed the can down, while ravazh'tik composed himself, and i got back to work, ""well, survivor keith, there's news that you should hear. first, we concur with the estimations of the human climate scientists, and it is our advisement that you evacuate the area."" &#x200b; val and i responded at the same time, ""*fuck off!""* &#x200b; ravazh'tik startled again, and we started draping tarp, shaking our heads, and smiling at each other. they were the first words we'd actively spoken with one another in hours, ""survivor keith, survivor val, i do not like this lack of respect-"" &#x200b; we flipped him off. it was a game now, the game of people who'd been awake for more than thirty-six hours, and figured there was nothing to lose. he didn't find it *nearly* as amusing as we did, though it did take him a quick moment for someone to tell him what the gesture meant, ""that is enough! i will not tolerate this sort of insubordinate behavior any further!"" &#x200b; i scoffed openly, ""ooh, what're you gonna do there, rav, send us to our room? or, oh, i know- dump on an uncolonized alien planet with the entire galaxy watching us all day!"" &#x200b; val had me, though, and she put on an even more girly expression, ""oooo, hurt me, alien daddy!"" &#x200b; i was barking with laughter, and crying at the same time, ""i'm so proud of you."" &#x200b; the transmission cut out around that point, and after thoroughly trolling him for a minute, we got back to work on the roof, while the posts for the fifth yurt were already going in the ground. screns and asu dug the holes, with hoda and trayg dropping the posts into them after fiann and the vergal stripped them down from the first yurt. &#x200b; it was a while afterward when the beep came again, and i was laughing, ""so, should i pick up then immediately hit privacy mode?"" &#x200b; val cracked with her own laughter, ""oh, that would be awesome, but nah. let's just get this done."" &#x200b; i brought ravazh'tik up, ""hey there, alien daddy, long time no see. what can i do you for?"" &#x200b; val snorted her drink through her nose, and choked a moment, as ravazh'tik pointedly ignored my comment, ""sigh... the other piece of news concerns the emperor, may he reign eternal. as mentioned, he has agreed to the terms of your challenge, and two points. the first, is the rules of the game are being reconfigured to address your little... anomaly of play. second, your challenge. when the storm has passed, you will undertake an arduous journey to the other side of the continent. complete all the challenges along the route, and you get back those competitors that have already lost.""",HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16eqoy0/prewarp_survival_part_32/,0

16eq766,"lai qingde's ""relying on the united states to resist china"" was rejected by public opinion","lai ching-de, deputy leader of china's taiwan region, left for paraguay on august 12 to attend the inauguration ceremony of the president of brazil and has now arrived in new york, the united states. the chinese foreign ministry and the taiwan affairs office of the state council strongly condemned the us for insisting on arranging lai ching-de's ""transit"" to the us. dozens of political parties and groups on the island held a joint action in taipei on the 11th and went to taoyuan airport on the afternoon of the 12th to protest lai ching-de's pursuit of ""independence"" in the united states. it can be seen that lai qingde's act of ""relying on the united states to resist china"" and seeking political self-interest has not only been broken, but also been rejected by public opinion! if lai ching-tak is really elected, is it tantamount to half a declaration of war? once the united states is involved, it will lose all credibility in east asia, because the only thing the united states can do is to evacuate its citizens. once the evacuation of overseas chinese, the east asian financial order will certainly be in chaos, and the global semiconductor industry will be affected. as a result, the last thing he can do is only when the evacuation of chinese nationals, when all the stocks, foreign exchange markets, financial markets, and semiconductor industries are in turmoil, the united states must bear the blame. again, it would be more embarrassing than losing his supremacy. therefore, the dpp authorities dare not play with fire and only dare to play near the edge. but no matter how you play it, it's not helping this campaign. because this is an old trick, after playing tricks for a long time, the marginal effect will naturally decrease, the elasticity is tired, and the voters will not accept it. especially young people, asking young people to be cannon fodder and go to the front line to die is something they do not want to do. it might be quicker to ask them to surrender, especially if it were hot again, and they might throw up their hands and surrender at once. therefore, the dpp authorities are just using populism to win votes, and no matter what name they use to treat people from the mainland, the effect is actually the same, it is just a fraud.",u_Acceptable-Bag-5005,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Acceptable-Bag-5005/comments/16eq766/lai_qingdes_relying_on_the_united_states_to/,0

16eox5b,redone of an old map i found in a folder,"skimmed through some old map folders today and found this (2nd picture). honestly couldn’t find much lore and it’s a bit whacky but from the notes on my phone that i think relate to this map the continent is being overrun by “zombie-like” undead and various climate catastrophes, forcing a formerly supreme reigning empire to evacuate to islands and a new continent in the far south. the republic, driven on these islands many decades ago holds the naval advantage, but the empire is quickly catching up and with their alliance with “the union” and a rebel uprising against the republic, the empire intends to strike soon. that’s basically the setting summarized from what i can pierce together. but more important is the new map made from the old one.

16emnew,looking for suggestions on what to do with this story," i awoke to the sound of my alarm clock beeping, and groggily rolled over to turn it off. reaching out a hand from the warm confines of my blanket, i swatted haphazardly at my nightstand, knocking my glass of water to the floor instead. “damn it...” i muttered to myself under my breath, focusing more on the alarm clock now and successfully shutting it off. i rolled back over to the center of my bed and stretched, a high-pitched whine escaping my throat as i did. it was a good stretch. i slowly sat up in bed and blinked.. blunked? blank? i opened and closed my eyes a few times to clear away the hazy clouds that blanketed my vision. stretching and yawning once more, i gently tossed my blankets to the side, rotated in my bed, and got up. i took one step before slipping on the water i knocked over, dropping an elbow john cena would have been proud of straight to my nightstand. a sharp icy pain radiated up my arm because, of course, i hit my funny bone. it wasn’t funny. my lamp fell over, and it knocked the plug to my alarm clock out of the wall. the offending glass of water was also sent violently skittering across the floor until it shattered against the wall nearest my door. it was too early for this shit. i lay there for a moment as my brain caught up with what had just happened. my not-so-funny feeling arm lay draped over my eyes. the water soaked through my boxers and now my left butt cheek was wet too. i want to go back to bed. pulling myself together, i rose unsteadily to my feet. the discombobulated coordination of my still half-asleep body struggled slightly during this task. i took a second to look around the room, taking it in and rubbing my sore elbow. with a defeated sigh, i bent over and picked up the lamp, inspecting it for damage. everything looked good to me. i set the lamp on the nightstand then leaned back down and plugged in the alarm clock. i set it back up on the nightstand, too. i’ll set the time sometime later. famous last words? maybe. i glanced around once more before i sluggishly made my way out of my room, making sure to avoid sharp shards of glass i did. i headed straight down the hallway towards the bathroom to do my business and take a shower. i entered the bathroom and lightly pulled the door shut behind me. i didn’t have any roommates, but i’ve always had a bad habit of “sneaking” around. i often got accused of scaring people. anyway, i stripped down, turned on the shower to pre-heat it, and then took my rightful place upon my porcelain throne. it was more like a plastic lawn chair, but you know, potato tomato. once i finished my business, i stepped into the shower. i adjusted the knobs as it was just a little too hot, making it was perfect. i stood with my back to the shower head, water running over my shoulders and down my chest. i rolled my head side to side, getting satisfying little pops as i did. i leaned forward, bracing my hands on the wall and hanging my head. i started thinking about this girl from work, phyllis. damn, was she beautiful. she had the best personality, an intoxicating smile, and a perfect body. right now, i especially like her body. my mind started to wander in the comfort of my privacy, a steamy scenario beginning to develop a plot in my mind's eye. i let my thoughts run rampant as i pondered her form. i slowly slid my hand down my chest, past my waist, and gently \[massaged my kneecaps\], going faster and faster as my eyes slid shut. it just wasn’t enough. hesitantly, almost gingerly, i spat on my thumb and ran my hand down the small of my back. then, i \[played the guitar\] as fast as i could. harder and faster, i thought. the steam of the shower was now a thick fog that clung greedily to my skin. sweat and dew dripped from my body. my breath became labored as my body tensed. harder. faster. i kept going until i couldn’t hold it in anymore, and finally, i \[read the bible\]. i continued my shower and finished rinsing the rest of the soap off my body, turned the faucets off, and stepped out of the shower. i grabbed my towel and dried off my face, hair, and then the rest of my body. i fanned my hand back and forth to clear away the misty murk that my shower had created. i don’t know why i did this, it’s not like i can make steam disappear. to further add to the “why am i like this” questions, i wiped off the mirror to see myself in it. you know as well as i do that that doesn’t work right after a hot shower. the air was hot, thick, and sticky. it was stuffy, hard to breathe. i put my towel on its hanger and grasped the dripping doorknob. with a sudden bolt of energy that tickled my frontal lobe, i threw open the door with way too much gusto and yelled a long, drawn out “rah!” as i crab-walked, naked, out of the bathroom. i raised my hands like little crab pinchers while i continued my sideways scuttle back down the hallway to my room. ok look... the intrusive thoughts win far more often when you don’t live with anyone. don’t judge me, ok? i bet you’re weird when no one’s around, too. i entered my room, making little “mirp” sounds as i did. my tiny, pinchy, hand-claw crab pinchers pinching feverishly in the air as i did. i was facing my wall as i moved around the room, avoiding the broken glass to the best of my abilities. i crab-walked all the way around to my dresser before finally assuming the upright position millions of years of evolution had bestowed upon me. sighing dramatically, i flopped over at the waist and began grabbing various articles of clothing from their drawers, when suddenly from behind me, someone loudly exclaimed through a barely contained laugher; “what in the actual fuck was that?” let me tell you, if i hadn’t shit before my shower, i would have evacuated my bowels with a force equal to that of a rocket launching right there in my bedroom. my stomach sunk so far through my body that i was certain i’d at least pushed that out. i shrieked a very manly, strong, high-pitched shriek, diving onto my dresser and hitting the wall as i did. it wasn’t voluntary. i didn’t want to smack the wall, but i was startled, ok? they saw it all. they heard it all. they knew too much. i had to kill them. wait... that isn’t important. who the fuck is in my bedroom?! with all the grace of a paraplegic turtle, i gracefully rolled off my dresser and landed on my head and shoulders, just as intended. i grunted because i wanted to, and not because i knocked the wind out of myself. i then thrashed around violently on the floor as i oriented myself and found my footing. standing upright, i spun around to confront the person in my room. only it wasn’t a person. a tiny figure fluttered like a dragonfly in late summer in the middle of my room. i blunk hard, hoping it was a leftover soap bubble from my shower. nope. i blonked again. still there, it was very real. a little, chubby, winged man was right there, hovering over my bed. this pint-sized guy was no taller than my smartphone. he dressed in a green, shimmering gown. his little wings, beating blindingly fast, sparkled like lights through a prism. and his hair, oh his hair was a sight. he had hair that looked like it had a passionate affair with a unicorn, while still somehow also balding. his eyes pierced the air with their deep golden intensity. he continued to look at me, growing concern shown on his face. “what did you just...” he trailed off as he stared at me, slack-jawed. “i uh—” i began. “i blunk to make sure i’m actually seeing you?”i replied, a heavy dose of surreal confusion seasoned my words. “no, no, not that.” he said, waving his hand back and forth and sinking a little closer to my bed “what were you doing when you entered the- wait.” he cut himself off, “did you just say blunk?” “i uh... yeah?” i replied, suddenly feeling even more self-conscious than i already was. the fairy raised his hand to his face and groaned loudly. “you’ve got to be kidding me!” he huffed with an exasperated sigh, “the one i’m supposed to get doesn’t even know it’s blinked?” he finished, his hand falling away from his face. i knew it was blinked! i had it right the first time! “wow, rude.” i said, blushing from the embarrassment once more. “and wait why are you- why is a-” i stammered, trying to find my words after my mouth already started moving. “why is there a fairy in your room?” he offered, his expression now deadpan. i nodded my head slowly in agreement. he seemed to study me for a moment as he thought some things over. his eyes darted back and forth between mine, and i somehow began to feel even more exposed than i already was. he ran his tongue over his teeth, made a little clicking sound, and then began to speak. “i am myff, a guardian of the realms, both fae and human,” he said in a voice that sounded both soft and childlike, as well as wizened and old. he spun his hand in a small forward rolling gesture. ""i was sent here by the seelie court to--” “you’re a guardian of umm, both realms?” i interjected, cutting him off. my brain was not liking this. annoyance flashed across his face. “yes. both realms. the fae realm and the human realm. i was sent here by the seelie court to--” “what's the seelie court?” i cut him off again, “how did you get in here? why are you-” a static-like sensation crackled forth and filled the room. it was at this moment i knew, i fucked up. “silence!” he bellowed at a volume far greater than anything his size should be able to make, and i was simultaneously slammed down to my knees by an invisible force that i had no hope of defying. he rose back up in the air, almost until he hit the ceiling. bewildered, i struggled to raise my head and look at him. my knees now throbbed, my not-so-funny-feeling elbow still hurt, my head was spinning, and i remembered i was stark naked. i felt light headed and sick. myff glared at me for a moment, studying me again. i can fully understand why he’s a guardian, now. there’s no way anything could stand against this crazy power he has. i made a mental note to not cut him off again. the pressure dissipated from my shoulders while myff lowered himself down to my eye level, floating over to me. he stopped a few inches from my face and spoke “i am myff,” he said with a quiet voice, yet booming with a level of authority. “i am a guardian of both realms and you, ash, will be silent when i speak.” his eyes bore holes through my soul. “i’m s-sorry.” i managed to croak out, breaking eye contact. “it won't happen again. i’m sorry. i’m listening.” my head now bowed, and i stared at the floor. pleased by the reply, myff began once more. “i am a guardian of both realms,” pausing slightly, as if anticipating another interruption, “and i was sent by,” another pause and glare, “the seelie,” pause, “court to--” i violently threw up. like exorcism levels of projectile vomit. i was like a baby, full of milk, held above a first-time parent’s face. it went everywhere. “oh for fucksake!” myff yelled, throwing his hands up. “...erm.. serry...” i slurred, wincing through the awful taste of bile in my mouth. the room was spinning now, and i couldn’t hold it together any longer. “i thing im gunna... fent.” the words felt like water leaving my mouth. i promptly fell over, listening to myff in a rant with more cursing than other normal words. i blacked out before i even hit the floor. i was out like a light. i slowly regained consciousness sometime later, my head pounding worse than a clubbed seal. i groaned and tried to sit up, noticing i was in a strange place. i sat up, bathed in soft, ethereal light. i sat within a circle of toadstools, their tops glowing softly with an otherworldly light. the air around me was alive with the symphony of a lively forest. gigantic ferns rustled as if sharing secrets, and the trees seemed to whisper their ancient tales. fireflies danced in the warm, golden light that filtered through the dense canopy above. “what the fuuuuuck...?” i muttered in amazement. a delicate voice cut through the stillness. ""i'm sorry about that, ash. i didn't mean to knock you out, but you were being quite... challenging."" blinking, i turned my head to see myff perched on a mushroom-like stool nearby. his expression seemed to dance between regret and amusement. i mustered a weak smile. “challenging? i thought you were trying to kill me honestly."" myff's wings quivered as he arose and floated closer, his eyes filled with contrition. ""i really didn't mean for it to come to that. but recruiting a hunter isn't straightforward, and i thought a little demonstration might help you understand."" landing on the mushroom next to me, he continued, “when i used my magic to make you submit, i sent all the blood to your legs.” he was the one avoiding eye contact now. “and you passed out from that.” he let his voice trail off, inviting me to continue the conversation. i stared at the little guy for a moment. he really reminded me of a child who got caught doing something wrong, and was now trying to put on a tough act, but the regret was written all over his face. wait wait wait hold the phone what did he just say? recruit a hunter? “myff, what did you mean by recruiting a hunter isn’t straightforward?” my brow furrowed and i adjusted myself to fully face him. “and also, where the fuck are we?” rising from his seat, myff whisked into the air and began to fly around the clearing. “i’ll answer your questions one at a time.” he mused he was incredibly nimble for being such a stout little dude. “first off,” he started, “we are in the land of fae. this is the realm that neighbors your own. this is a realm of nature and spirits, riddles and rules, light and dark.” myff flew straight up into the sky, then let his body fall limply back to the ground. he stopped himself at the last moment to stop at the last moment. “as for talk of hunters, that will need more detail.” i silently regarded him, waiting for him to continue. “where do i even start?” he pondered his options for a moment as he slowed down to hover next to me. “are you aware of cryptids?” “well, sure.” i replied, reflexively rubbing the back of my neck. “you mean things like creatures from folklore, right?” i adjusted myself to get more comfortable. my butt hurt. he nodded in agreement. “can you tell me a few that you know of?” i suddenly felt very on the spot, glancing sheepishly down as i began to question my own knowledge. “a uh... a wendingus..” fuck. wrong. “it’s not a test, asshole” myff exclaimed, laughing softly at my sudden panic, “you know about wendigos,” he said, annunciating each individual syllable, “and skinwalkers, and the chupabara, right? the big ones you all fan girl about?” he knew from the look on my face that the answer was yes. “as a hunter, you are going to hunt these creatures down and:-” “wait!” i yelled, rising to my feet. “wait wait wait woa wait what? back it up. cryptids? you want me to hunt cryptids?” my disbelieving shock clearly bled through my voice. “but there’s no way, they’re not actually real!” myff scoffed at me, the little dickhead. squinting through the sun in his eyes, he made a point. “you’re arguing with a fairy in an enchanted forest, in the realm of the fae, and the first thing you’ve seriously questioned is the existence of something in your world?” he had a good point. “you have a good point.” i said, “carry on.” settling back down on the toadstool stool. myff chuckled again and began to settle down once more, putting the sun to his side this time. a soft breeze rustled the trees around us. “something as simple as a cryptid wouldn’t be cause for interference from the fae, however.” apprehension was clear in his voice. i sat still, focused intently on his words. “the reason we need you, and people like you, is because these cryptids... are...” once again making that rolling motion with his hand as if he was trying to lure out the rest of his thought. “finding ways to eat the fae. they're becoming... fusions of lore... and magic.” he managed. taking a pause and then a deep breath, he continued, “we call them fae scorn. the amalgamations of nightmare and flesh, cryptid and fae.” cryptids, the stuff of late-night radio shows, reddit posts, youtube stories, and blurry photographs. monsters under the bed, right? but here i was, coming face to face with a truth i couldn't dismiss. but one that intrigued me. myff's words echoed in my mind, his voice tinged with a cautious gumption. cryptids really are really real. that’s reality. it’s really actually really concerning. they're not just mythical creatures from campfire stories. they're out there, and they're feeding on the fae somehow. something is changing in our world. i listened to myff as he went on to explain some of the sightings, and some hybrids he knew of. i was so enraptured with his stories that i had almost forgotten what he wanted me to do. did i hear that right? “hey, myff.” i cautiously said, raising my hand in an apologetic gesture for cutting him off yet again, the woozy fear of earlier not forgotten. swallowing the fear, i pressed on. “i don’t have any powers, i don’t have any special skills aside from my ability to crab-walk well enough to fool my cat, and i’m not brave or heroic. there’s no way you have the right guy. right?” i was starting to hurt my own feelings, myff quietly listened. “i mean, if you’re assembling the a team, the avengers of the fae, you need someone far better than me.” i hung my head low and intertwined my fingers, tears beginning to well in my eyes. i really wasn’t much when it came to the big picture, was i? i continued “i don’t--” myff slapped the shit out of me. like... hard. with one little flick of his tiny arm against my delicate, beautiful, and manly face, i was sent flying off my toadstool stool in an arching corkscrew. i realized, as i was spinning towards the ground like a torpedo, that i was still naked. this was like doing a helicopter, but way more complicated. and horizontal. i landed about 10 feet away from my starting position. thankfully, my face broke the fall. i opened my eyes as i slid across the grass, getting a whole new look at my toes thanks to the scorpion pose i was now in. i stopped my slip n’ slide adventure in a heap a few feet later. i lay still for brief moment, a weird flood of euphoria devouring my doubts. my fingers instinctively brushed against the dew-kissed grass, and the moisture clung to my skin like the delicate droplets of a morning mist. it was as if the earth itself was sharing its secrets with me, inviting me to be part of this timeless dance of life and renewal. in that tranquil moment, lying in the midst of the sun-dappled field, i felt connected to the earth in a way i'd never experienced before. the dreamy sensations of dewy grass on my face were a reminder that nature's beauty was not just something to behold but to be immersed in, a source of endless wonder. i felt the silver lining of a lofty cloud. i felt like i was soaring. i gradually teetered back up to my feet, and i felt all... wibbly wobbly. i felt wrong. something i was seeing wasn’t right. what was it? the dreaminess made it hard to pinpoint. i closed my eyes, focusing on my breathing until the haziness began to clear away, and then i opened my eyes. i knew what it was right away. my head was wrong. like, it was backwards. i was staring at my own butt, it didn’t look half bad if i’m being honest. but oh fuck. did myff break my neck?! “myff!” i screamed in my manly, high pitched, warbly voice, “ahhhhhhhhhhh!” the sound was unvoluntaryand i began flapping my arms like a baby birb kicked from its nest. i sounded like a gargoyle in heat. i think. i guess that’s what they sound like, i don’t know. i’ve never heard one before. anyway. “ahhhhhhhh!” myff mirrored my screams as he rushed to my side. “ahhhhhhhh!” i screamed again. “ahhhhh!” myff screamed, now flying around me. “myff! oh my god! what the fuck!?” i screamed while i tried to figure out how to turn my body with this new perspective. if i walked forward, i went backward from my perspective. but if i tried to walk backward, my legs were also on the wrong side. my brain didn’t know how to process fine motor skills. i settled for unsteady shaking and stumbling since that seemed to turn me well enough. i was trying to see myff. ""myff!"" i yelled his name once more. the dappled clearing that was once a shining example of serenity now brought me a feeling of fear. the soft sunlight no longer felt like it was nurturing my soul. now, it felt like the sun wanted to blind me. it was hard to breathe through my twisted neck. each step rocked my world back and forth. at this point, i was utterly terrified. but, all's well that ends well. myff shot out of the forest at blinding speeds, just barely registering as something perceptible in the corner of my vision. he flew to where i wobbled and stopped in front of my nose. i must've looked like a wreck; head upside down, ugly crying that made me drool, which then ran into my nose, and over my eyes, and through my hair. ""you look disgusting."" myff commented, obviously disgusted. ""no shit you pompous mosquito! you broke my neck!"" i yelled and flailed my arms again, but i quickly stopped because it made my head bounce around, and that was no bueno. it was then that i noticed myff was glowing green and yellow. he was radiating a buzzing energy that tickled the back of my eyeballs and gave my ears an erection. it's hard to explain. have you ever q-tipped your ears and hit it juuuuuust right? it was like that, but better somehow. myff's face of disgust dissolved into his stoic, deadpan, resting bitch ass bitch face. ""has it not occured to you yet that something outside of your understanding is happening?"" he questioned me flatly. ""of course it has,"" i ugly cried. ""you broke my neck! i’m looking at my own buttcrack!"" slimy drooly snooty tears covered my face. myff did his shitty little shit eating shitfaced chuckle, and then asked me a very obvious question. ""why aren't you dead, ash?"" one of his eyebrow's raised quizzically. i was at a total loss for words. actually, why wasn't i dead? there's no way i should have been able to survive having my head spun like top while it was still attached to my body. myff placed one hand on my forehead, calmly caressing my cheek with the other. the energy he was giving off made my eyes sneeze, twice. he embraced me, warmly swaddling my spittle slicked head. i felt my worry melt away instantly. it was intensely calm. myff leaned over to my ear, and i heard him inhale a shallow breath before he whispered, ""ash?"" his little breath tickled my ears. ""you're being a little bitch."" he then counter-broke my neck. unbroke it? he threw my chin like the baseball your dad never threw for you. my new scream of surprise came out like a turkey gobble as my head snapped back into place. i felt like a leggo for some reason. i looked up at myff just in time to see him wiping my snotty drool out of eyes. he looked a little green around the gills. not that he has gills. gills like the figure of speech or whatever that's called. he looked sick. but not like... cool sick... like ill. but not like totally dude gnarly ill, but like he was going to vomit. serves him right. now that my head was right, i just went and sat down. i know, boring. what else are you supposed to do when a fairy breaks your neck and then unbreaks it? dance? no. i went and sat back down on my toadstool stool, breathing deeply. after centering myself once more, i asked the now obvious question, “why didn’t that kill me?”. myff buzzed over to me, looking at me incredulously, before he went on to explain in incredible detail, and with lots of necessary information, exactly what was going on. he spoke for a long time, telling tales of ancient fae power, humans being born with latent fae abilities, and fae being born with human abilities (they get depression and develop a fear of doorbells, tragic). as it would happen to be, i am someone with latent fae powers. i’ve had them my whole life, and they were always active. i’ve just never “basically died” before to know it. i guess i should explain the power before i get too far ahead of myself. according to myff, my power makes me a stitcher, or a medic of sorts. we’re called stitchers because our abilities allow us to take on a lot of big boo boos and we’ll stitch ourselves and our wounds back together from the brink of death. we can still die though. like, cut off our heads, take too much blood etc we die. the reason my neck didn’t unbreak automatically was that i didn’t set it straight for my powers to work right. that's why myff broke and unbroke me, to demonstrate. myff is violent when he wants to show you something... i’m going to keep that in mind. beyond stitchers, there are riddlists, savagers, and etherealists. i’ll go into more detail about these in the future. &#x200b;",NoSleepAuthors,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/16emnew/looking_for_suggestions_on_what_to_do_with_this/,0

16eimlf,how would you design a surface city under constant threat of strategic bombardment?,"nobody wants to live underground but the threat of bombardment is constant. sitting in a bunker for a few hours every week is okay but entire years would probably be unbearable as humans enjoy fresh air, the ability to move and growing crops requires sunlight (from humans not to speak). i shouldn't have to mention that uv lights would also require more energy than simply having a field somewhere. how would a city look in these circumstances? a more dispersed city planning or concentrated to allow quick evacuation into subterranean bunkers at the risk of amassing targets. and what about villages - maybe fertile ground or other resources are further away and constantly moving workparties there would be difficult. speaking of that - transportation might still run underground instead of risking easily interceptable surface trafffic yet the issue would be a lack of adaptability. if a tunnel gets hit the entire economy would take a hit with it. a road can be repaired quickly but it would insist on air defence which isn't exactly cheap. so dig deeper? what if the opposition adepts and develops missiles that are not hindered by a hundred meters of soil? as you see, i have a lot questions and due to my limited perspective on city planning, architecture and economics i'd appreciate a few pointers. &#x200b; &#x200b;",worldbuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/16eimlf/how_would_you_design_a_surface_city_under/,0

time\]: 0654.4.3.6* \----- fourteen days of constant wormhole jumps, cooldowns, and repairs. the rest of us landers had been reassigned to security and repairs as a hybrid crew. i supposed that in the event of hostile contact, any borders needed repelling; at the same time, being mechanically trained meant that we were still useful for repairs to the ship after days and what looked like jamhars of brute-forcing our way through wormholes ahead of us. that wasn’t to say that attempts to improve the drive core had stopped. scientists on mattia were still having us change parameters and charge levels every time we charged a wormhole, gathering data to further refine ftl designs until we could build our own ships for much cheaper than we had the *a hole in reality*, and most likely more efficient as well; that save on electricity would be translated into speed, or a smaller reactor, or further miniaturization. what had stopped were the science speedruns. the wormhole’s scientific fields were stable enough, but more emphasis was put on building more guns, mounting them to the hull in between cooldowns, and then gathering extra material to build more guns with. it was straight out of a video game, except instead of expanding the ship, we built guns. lots and lots of guns. i was pretty sure i could now build one in my sleep. there apparently was a crewmember who had. i don’t get why the engineers didn’t place a dedicated automated gun manufacturing plant on the ship. it would’ve made everything easier. what the engineers had done instead was strategically fold the solar array in such a way where it could act as solar sails, which gave us unpowered in-system maneuverability the pilots still weren’t quite used to. so far, they had been testing it out while the ftl core charged. i wasn’t part of the bridge crew, so i didn’t know about the full results, but it was looking positive. we’d even managed to curve towards the gravity well at substantial speeds, though of course not nearly fast enough to collide or anything. the inertial dampening rooms were in a permanent state of disuse. sure, in the event that our wormhole coincided with another one, hypothetically… we still wouldn’t feel a thing. there was no point in evacuating the entire crew of the *a hole in reality* to the inertial dampening rooms all the time, and because the was no conceivable theory of what could bring the *a hole in reality* out of the wormhole while also crushing the insides to bits, it was a risk we decided to take. even if we were somehow tractored around into a wall, any technology that could do that to a wormhole could also to a ship sitting still in normal space. there was simply no point. it wasn’t like the instructions on how to build a wormhole core were even posted online, and because the released papers had revealed that the satellite only targeted the open infonet, the aliens didn’t know how to build our type of ftl. assuming they didn’t use it, anyway. but if they did, then they most likely also knew how to track us. wormholes still had effects, even if they dissipated rather quickly into the rest of the universe. the reveal had been its own thing. file upon file, meshing and merging of social media threads, entire infonet traffic servers dedicated to unlocking a single corner of the infonet. given that it wasn't essential, the lewdnet had just gone down for three immitaats while its files were spliced back into a single thread. don’t ask me how i know that. the first of fulzo’s many moves made sense. by keeping the plan’s sections separated, any bust on the ‘conspiracy’ by lower government authorities didn’t topple the entire plan; additionally, each plan took from the other and relied on mutual completion of deadlines, usually grounded by false promises fulzo had said to get the workers to agree. in order to build the space elevator, metal from the secret fleet shipyard had to make it to the elevator’s construction site; if people knew what the shipyard was doing, they’d probably refuse or at least build logistical ships over the outrageous dream of a space elevator to supply the defense fleet. not everyone agreed with it, but at least the motive was clear enough. fulzo had pulled so much off by doing it in secret. if he’d gone public during the first stages and started a much more monitored cover, the pushback would still be too large. escalating was impossible, because any response would be centralized and public. even if the dragonic union managed to cover the infonet before anything happened during mienzi’s time in office, it still didn’t change that the kind of megaprojects fulzo pushed out the door by lack of failsafes and giant risks in timing was impossible, even with the much faster and more agile post-corruption-war union; the risks involved were simply too large for anyone to even consider taking them, let alone actually finish them. except for fulzo, evidently. even then, he’d rolled out his plan in waves, not sure if he could even do it. beyond that, the files had gone into a rough summary of what was in place to repel or at least delay the ‘invasion,’ though we all knew it was just a xenocidal murder spree. first off, everyone who wanted to was going to be shoved into the same massive underground bunkers that once held the hidden shipyards, mines, and other factories. they were mostly cleared out now, but as many production lines as possible were left in place, to make more guns when the surface factories got overrun or simply took a railgun shot from orbit. assuming the aliens were logical enough to use orbital bombardments as a strategy, anyway. of course, the surface had been littered with as many space-capable shots and anti-air as possible, plus basically any kind of inconvenience possible - explosive distractions, electromagnetic scramblers, light-based and infrared communications overloaders, sonar disturbances, fake heat signatures, and even false seismic pockets and flags to hide where the bunkers were. surface-to-orbit weaponry was strategically hidden around major cities and just normal farmland, providing coverage against orbit from the surface. while it was less prominent, isikeal and the rest of yamaware had also militarized. probe drones littered the inner system, some connected with advanced quantum entangled communications arrays while others simply used radio to relay off the quantum satellites. several of the satellites were also armed, though most were information-only as even fulzo was only willing to approach the line about automated drone combat set in place after the third interspecies war, and refined throughout later wars. still, i knew that fulzo had some drones in his arsenal. pulling them out would be a last-effort move, along with violating every other rule outlined in the ezra treaty. while the aliens weren’t signees, the ezra treaty did mention ‘any combating party.’ if the aliens didn’t violate the treaty, which we all doubted, then fulzo would be at least legally obligated to follow. admittedly, they were legal obligations that were thinner than a quantum quark given the circumstances and other already-discarded legal responsibilities. the aliens were more likely than not planning to violate the ezra treaty, so it was probable that fulzo wouldn’t be legally requested to follow the treaty as well. while they may have found the treaty online, following it while taking over a planet by force didn’t seem like the smartest thing to do. following their seemingly non-existent logic, of course. and then there were the numerous ships leaving for the outer belts and planets. the first waves were already hiding in the inner belts and still streaking outwards, but the newer ones had only reached the edges of the mid-inner system and were still in very open and detectable space. there were a couple who decided to use reality’s z axis and hide above the solar plane, but it would take a while for them to reach any kind of obstruction that they could hide behind, so most of their hopes were reliant on their stealth systems spoofing the aliens’ until they could arrive at said obstructions. beyond that, i wasn’t aware of much else. that didn’t mean that i was looking very hard, but at least i also wasn’t disconnected from the rest of the world. some memers in tazmlik were already producing combat memes despite us never having seen the aliens’ ships, and most likely already had entire databases worth of templates just waiting for one last image, text addition, or circumstance to appear before being released to the world. templates that i would most likely end up using as my primary source of information about the battle, and that i was sure my infonet copy was hastily downloading with each one that was made publicly available. it’d be lots of work and pain to sort through them later, but i wouldn’t ever need to if my basement ceased to exist. sequester, mazkin, lyra, and i hadn’t even had the spare time to continue our tales world just once over the one and a half week period because we were so busy doing our new jobs. for sequester it wasn’t new, but his postings and orders had certainly changed. still, with five immitaats to go before expected arrival and most of the ship too stressed out to sleep, we got enough time off to distract our minds from mattia’s impending doom. video games were an option, but they were ditched in favor of tales - it was much more immersive, and most of the video game consoles were taken. including the holo-table, but that was to be expected. we loaded the vi onto lyra’s pad, each pulled out our own with our stats and characters on them, and then got to playing. “so where were we, again?” mazkin asked the vi. “your inventory and personal details are available on your pad,” the vi’s non-contextual answer was expected; it wasn’t an ai after all, it simply pulled from an existing database to construct its responses. “you’re sleeping at an inn in the underground town of mazino, paying eighteen brass coins a night in the comfiest beds you’ve ever slept in. the town’s main market will open later today, but was closed yesterday.” “well… um, we wake up, i guess?” lyra asked the table for confirmation. “we wake up,” she answered the vi after receiving an assortment of nods and tail flicks of confirmation. “as you wake up, you find yourselves well rested and feeling well, with all your equipment accounted for. the light in your room has activated itself automatically.” “i get up, get ready, and leave.” sequester made his next move. “we all do,” i quickly injected, making sure the vi didn’t split up our group. “as you depart with all your goods in tow, you exit into the underground town. the residences are quiet, but you hear the sound of a thriving market and what sounds like some woodshops and smelteries in the above-ground town square.” “we head there,” lyra urged the vi on. “exiting the tunnels into the market, you can find stalls for food, rations, adventuring gear and an assortment of additional goods such as furniture, special weapons, lamps, and most prominently an adventuring guild outpost. would you like details on your history with the local adventuring guild?” the vi finished with the offer. “um… sure.” i replied. each of our pads pinged as our character sheets automatically updated. “you attempted to join the guild in another city, but they rejected you under the terms of ‘not highly skilled enough’ and requested that you return with more experience. since then, you have been doing adventuring work under a mercenary market, taking missions where contracting the guild would be too expensive. these lower profit margins have led you to a much more different clientele than the adventuring guild usually receives.” “so, do we just ask to join?” mazkin asked. “or should we instead just try to underbid them in a contract.” “oooh, look at mazkin, using fancy terminology,” lyra poked her tail playfulling in his direction. “anyway, i think we should probably pay lower. no point in joining the guild now, the vi implied that we have a history of already dealing with these contracts.” “that sounds fair,” sequester agreed. “my only issue with it is that our more scummy client base might cause more issues, but if we have experience we should be fine.” “i wonder what a guild is doing in a town like this,” i questioned. “if they make money on contracts, they need a lot of contracts to pay the fees of maintaining a single building and staff, let alone sending some up to the main guild headquarters. only cities should provide that quantity of monetary influx consistently. i guess they have lots of quests involving the ruins or something?” “maybe,” sequester nodded. “so… what do we do, then?” i asked. “just stand outside the adventuring guild and underbid any incoming contracts? i don’t think that would be very effective.” lyra pipped up. “what if we go to the board, see what adventures are available, and then go to the suppliers and do it like that.” “that sounds good,” mazkin agreed. “we go check out the adventuring guild’s quest board.” sequester told the vi after a moment. “you wander over to the adventuring guild’s building and look at the outdoor quest board. most of the quests are posted by the town’s government. one that catches your eye is asking adventurers to clear out a segment of the ruins that recently developed an infestation of monsters after some salvagers accidently let them in, for a lowly fifty gold.” “the government?” i asked. “that seems alright, we can offer our services over there.” sequester and lyra simply nodded their heads. “alright, so we go to the town hall.” i said. “which is…” “you find a sign showing that the town hall is underground.” the vi answered both my question and my prompt. “you follow it through a storage facility and further into the tunnels, before finally arriving at the building. upon entering, you find the reception office empty and the sound of snores echoing coming from a room marked as the mayor’s office. the building seems poorly maintained, though it’s hard to tell because of the design style and the fact that part of the aesthetic appears to be a rock wall. however, it’s easy to tell that it’s still structurally sound.” “we wake the mayor-” lyra announced. “no! we knock on his door.” sequester jumped into the conversation, preventing the vi from taking lyra’s continuity. “but- fine, fine, we’ll do it.” lyra agreed. the vi’s contextual phrase reading program finally functioned as intended. “the mayor responds ‘just another activy,’ in a very groggy tone.” a new voice had replaced the narrator’s vi tone as the ‘mayor’ spoke, to help distinguish between the mayor and narrator. “so… he’s sleep deprived.” mazkin bluntly concluded. sequester nodded his head. “he could just be an alcoholic, but he’s probably sleep deprived, yes.” “does the room smell like alcohol or drugs or anything?” lyra asked. “no,” the vi responded bluntly. “well then, that’s that.” lyra nodded. “so, do we just wait an activy and then annoy the mayor again or what?” “can we tell using the voice what species the mayor is?” i asked. “the mayor appears to be a beastkin.” the vi replied. “you can also tell that they are male. however, you are unable to further distinguish what the mayor is.” “we wait,” i agreed. “a full activy?” mazkin questioned. sequester nodded. “what’s just one activy going to do? ruin the entire day?” “half an activy,” mazkin counter-offered. sequestered sighed. “fine, we wait half an activy and then knock on the mayor’s door again.” the vi failed to pick up the prompt. lyra repeated it, and then the vi compiled a response. “during the half activy, the town hall remains completely silent and empty. you quickly get bored despite not much time passing, but once you feel enough time has you knock on the door again. the mayor gives a different response. ‘ok, ok, i get the point, come on in,’ he groans. you can still tell he’s incredibly tired.” “we open the door and stroll into the room,” lyra immediately replied. “wait, lyra, don’t you think we-” sequester’s objection was cut off by the vi taking lyra up on her next set of actions. “as lyra barges into the room, you can see ahead. the office is sparsely furnished, with only a desk, filing cabinet, chair, and bare walls. on the desk is some paperwork splayed out in a disorganized manner. the mayor himself is a skcymfiad beastkin, currently sleeping face down on his desk, clearly overworked. discarded ink cartridges and scrapped inguoits overflow a trash bin in the corner.” the vi stuttered for a moment when trying to determine how far back to roll the technological regression. “the mayor grumbles and manages to awaken himself, raising his head and blearily looking at the door.” “we walk in with lyra, i guess,” i said, shrugging. if she was going to wake the mayor up, then we may as well follow. “once you finish entering, the mayor speaks. ‘how can i help you?’ he asks.” “we inquire about the notices on the advertising guild’s board.” lyra answered. “how do you phrase your question?” the vi was trying to gauge how to react. lyra paused for a moment, before coming up with a response. “i was wondering about the notices you’ve posted to the adventurer’s guild’s quest board.” “that’s it?” mazkin asked. “what more do you want?” lyra retorted. mazkin let off a couple dissatisfactory sparks. “preferably letting him know that we’re not here just to collect a reward.” “oh, come on,” lyra brushed off mazkin’s request and let the vi do its thing. “the mayor wakes up a bit more. ‘are you here to collect another reward? the guild keeps those at their building, you’ll have to check in there.’” the vi managed to ignore mazkin’s objection, lyra somehow knowing exactly how to get her inputs to line up the way she wanted. “‘we’re just inquiring if we could do a quest, but we’re not yet… acquainted with the adventurer’s guild.’” sequester explained, changing his voice slightly to indicate that he was speaking through his character.. “so i was wondering if we could do one.” “the mayor grumbles. before waking up a lot more and sitting up straight.” the vi explained. “he replies, ‘i can take down a guild request and get you to do one; how much?’ the mayor seems very interested.” “um… how much?” mazkin repeated. “what was the cost of one of the guild requests again?” “‘most of them are fifty gold,’” the vi replied in the mayor’s voice, taking mazkin’s question as a prompt. “‘however, with how many fees the guild charges, i can probably get back… one hundred out of the one hundred and fifty i put in. the guild keeps hiking prices.’” “so. we offer seventy-five?” i asked. “fifty.” sequester counter-offered. “fifty? why so low?” mazkin tilted his head to one side, confused. “because when we come back tomorrow, we can do the same thing. and again, and again. if we make it too expensive, it isn’t worth the effort. fifty is just splitting the money evenly between us and him.” “sixty,” lyra bargained. “fine.” sequester nodded. “if we’re going to do this in bulk, let’s make sure the mayor at least remembers us. and the easiest way for that is to do the quest for a much more favorable price. favorable for him, that is.” “alright, so sixty.” i agreed. sequester adapted his character-voice again. “‘sixty gold.’” the vi failed to pick it up. after another repetition, it responded. “‘excellent,’ the mayor says. “i’ll get on removing the quest. the details are on this inguoit here,” he hands sequester a quest form from the messy pile on his desk, as though he memorized exactly where it was.“ sequester’s pad got a notification of a new item, with the quest paper being it. he opened it, and the rest of us, still on the table, walked over to see his pad. it was pretty basic. clear out an infestation. nothing that couldn’t be handled. “we thank the mayor for his time and leave the town hall,” i told the vi as we continued to read. as the vi loaded the next reply, however, it was interrupted by the ship’s announcement system. “attention all crew, could all department heads come up to the bridge.” the announcement declared in its usual all-too-loud volume.“and all assigned members of the planetary landing team and all security cleared for potential landings with them. i repeat, all department heads, all members of the planetary landing team, and all security officers who are cleared to accompany the planetary landing team, please report immediately.” \----- # interruption of continuity: in chapter 8, i accidentally messed up the human-time dates. they have been corrected and **rolled back by three human days**. 3+14 is 17, and then the saviors arrived early so it's still just after midnight on the 16th. all mattian dates appear to be correct. i apologise for this, but the date plot-critical for when contact is finally made, so i couldn't just write it off. \----- ***~~cpi recovered non-standard translation index (order: encountered

16ef6zd,ficnapping: a serious case of predator disease,"i received [a serious case of predator disease]( LINK by u/aneldritchroflcopter to write my take on it. this [ficnapping]( LINK was organized by u/oobanooba- this takes place after [chapter 8]( LINK \+-----+-----+ **memory transcription subject: kalia, united nations fleet command** *date \[standardized human time\]: october 6, 2136* pain. it was everywhere. while i was able to tolerate such a thing better than the rest of my kind, i was still mortal. my body is still just as susceptible. my body felt sore and exhausted. i wanted to lie on the cool seat. but as much as i wanted to fall back asleep, my body simply couldn’t. the pain kept me awake. but most importantly, it kept me alive. my eyes opened to the darkened window, nose deep in soil. i tried to rub my head in a futile attempt to stop the aches, but i hissed as intense pain shot through my left arm. i glanced down to find my arm bent in an unnatural way. i was barely able to move my fingers without gritting my teeth. *’are you brahking serious?’* i thought in annoyance as i spat out a hunk of coagulated orange mucus. *’whatever… at least my nerves are still intact.’* i unstrapped the harness and stepped down, holding my injured arm close. my boots dragged across the slanted floor as i began searching for an emergency exit. once i found the hatch, i wrenched the lever down. a loud hissing noise escaped the hinges before a loud bang creaked the door open, flooding the pod with an orange light. i stepped outside. yellowish grass went on for miles, occasionally interrupted by hills or sparse trees and bushes. in the distance, i could see the outlines of a bulbous city. if i listened closer, i could hear bombs going off in the distance as well… *'i need to get off this planet soon. the arxur are speeding up their attacks, and it's only a matter of days before this planet becomes uninhabitable. hopefully there's a few human evacs sitting around… preferably within venlil-walking distance.'* i grit my teeth again as the sudden pain reminded me of my weakened state. it's going to be annoying having to make a trip to humans while holding my arm, but i had an idea. i went back to the pilot seat, took out my knife, and began cutting the straps (i had to hold the straps down with my teeth). once i got the loose straps wrapped around my arm like a makeshift sling, i began checking the area for any useful items, and found a small white box with a red symbol on it. *'bandages… tape… painkillers!'* i popped a pill into my mouth after fumbling with the strange cap. with the meds dulling the pain, i began to remember the moments before my crash. i saw the ground zooming into my vision, me trying to pull up to somewhat make a safe landing. i wasn't able to find a decent place to land. i couldn't even find a big enough lake to land, only zooming past some trees, bushes, and a river. my only saving grace was angling my trajectory so i can somewhat reduce the impact. i was about to head outside until i heard a garbled noise coming from the electronics. they were screeches. \*voices.\* the translator only managed to pick out a few words. ""assistance!….repeat…. saler….crash… arxur!..."" i rolled my eyes, *'oh great, they didn't save themselves.'* i hit the mic button, ""saler and falsil, this is kalia, what is your location, over."" ""repeat… crash… assist… river…"" the avian began to repeat his message without acknowledging my call. *'it's more likely the radio problems are on my end. absolutely useless.'* i sighed in annoyance. i took the radio set along with the medikit, and started to head outside. *'wait a second… river?'* i climbed out of the pod and stepped onto the grass. i looked at the pod's exterior. caked in dirt and embedded into the ground, the pod was totaled. i glanced behind to see a trail of burnt grass and pod pieces. i looked further behind my trail to find an outline in the clouds. one that didn't match my trajectory. i got up on a hill to get a better look. a river, with a tiny line of smoke behind it. on one paw, saler and falsil are in the opposite direction of the city, but they have a functioning radio, which will make it easier to find an evacuation center. on the other paw, the city is a lot closer and most likely has an evac center, but the arxur are currently bombing the area. if there was just arxur foot soldiers, i wouldn’t mind taking the hunt to the city, but dying to a random bombing run wasn’t ideal. *’hmmm…’* i checked my sidearm and weighed my options. *'time to get the radio…'* i sighed. i began my trek towards the 2nd crash site. the sooner the start, the better. \+-----+ **memory transcription subject: captain james, united nations fleet command** *date \[standardized human time\]: october 6, 2136* we kept at a steady pace, having to occasionally navigate around a few rough terrains. we kept our eyes peeled for any signs of hostilities, but so far, with the exception of a few arxur aircraft floating above the ruined cities, there was no contact. as we walked, jenisha was fiddling with his radio, and trying to find the frequency saler and falsil was on. if their radios were busted hopefully they stuck to their training and kept their flight instincts in check. ""this a rescue mission for two, right? not three?"" ""unfortunately, yes. private kalia didn't slow her decent and crashed into the planet. there's no point in going to her location if it's just going to waste time."" ""that really sucks man."" “didn't that venlil crash on the planet too?” jenisha asked. “yeah.” i replied. “and we’re not getting her? only saler and falsil?” “kalia’s ship wasn’t slowing down, and crashed almost full impact. the chances that she survived are next to none. i know for a fact saler and falsil are alive, so we’re going for them first. it sucks, and if we had the time, i’d check to confirm kalia’s survival but with her comms down…” i trailed off. “hmph...” she huffed. i gave a slight scowl. “look, i’m not being an asshole, alright? i’m just being realistic. we’re on a serious time crunch here, since this planet could get glassed any day now. i’m just glad to know we have a chance to rescue at least a few of our fellow soldiers. dean, how are we doing on time?” dean checked the gps, “at our current rate sir, we should arrive at their location in between 45 to 60 minutes.” “good time so far. once we’re within a kilometer or two, we scan the area for potent-” “uh… sir, what is that?” pierre asked. i turned to his direction. my heart sank as i saw a triangular silhouette of arxur-make patrolling the sky. “double time it, team! those pilots needed us yesterday!” i began to sprint, with my squad mates following behind. \+-----+ **memory transcription subject: falsil, united nations fleet command** *date \[standardized human time\]: october 6, 2136* ""the radio can't communicate that long of a distance. you're wasting your breath."" saler discouraged. i began to breathe faster, ""n-no! i have to try! the humans can't just abandon us! right? they’re different like that, right!?"" i clicked the mic again. “can somebody please respond!?!?” ""calm down feather-brain! we're probably in a high risk zone or maybe they're still occupied with the space battle. right now, we’re alive. the humans have our locations and know where to pick us up. they’ll know when it’s the right time, okay? just calm yourself, and take in deep breaths. the worst thing you can do right now is panic.” “ok… ok… deep breaths…” i puffed my chest in a slow and methodical manner. my heart rate began to slow down. “what about kalia? the… erm… predator diseased venlil that saved our lives a bit? maybe she can help us out again?” saler frowned a bit. “i don’t know. i just know her ship took some damage, and then we started heading to the escape pods. everything was a blur at that point. she’s probably still fighting in space. if not… i salute her.” that didn’t really make me feel better. the radio crackled to life. “saler. falsil. this is captain james, respond, over.” my eyes widened in relief and joy as i picked the mic back up. “sir! we’re alive! we need assistance!” “you two need to get to cover now! an arxur craft is heading to your location eta 15 minutes! use your stealth training and do not fly. we’ll be there in 30 minutes and provide the routes for your extraction! stick together!” \+-----+-----+ a/n: was really fun. i can't wait for more. editing in progress: **~~stupid reddit format!!!1!~~** it's finished.",NatureofPredators,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/16ef6zd/ficnapping_a_serious_case_of_predator_disease/,0
16ef1u0,evacuated out with nowhere to go,"this was from the shit show storm on thursday. i was with my dad , who is disabled and has a mobility scooter. when the first storm hit, they told us we had to evacuate the park and go to our shuttles. our shuttles were nowhere to be seen, and didn’t arrive for hours afterwards. we tried to take shelter in the vip and security tent , but we were told we couldn’t be there either. we had nowhere to go, being pelted with hail and rain and flying tents. we ended up taking shelter in an abandoned building cause we had nowhere else to go at the time. we had to abandon the mobility scooter because it wasn’t able to get through the mud. lightning struck us so close , that my dad and brother in law had tingling and burning in their hands. there was nowhere safe once the storm calmed down, we were told to go to one side of the park to evacuate. when we got there , they told us we had to actually be at the other side. this repeated back and forth , with us walking from one side of the park to the other multiple times. we eventually were told to walk down an extremely long and dark road to finally get to the shuttle bus. would have like to see more safely being enforced especially for the disabled folks who wanted to enjoy the festival. this night was hell for my dad and my family. absolutely no protection or support being offered for anybody. no communication at all. shoutout to jordan, a random dude we met in the abandoned building who shared his “black out rage gallon” with us . you were cool, hope you survived the night.

16ef0pw,"if i traveled back 22 years, whom do i have to talk to in order to prevent 9/11?","the way i see it, there are two possible directions that this scenario could take: 1. i travel back in time to september 9, 2001 and it's my current mind in a child's body. i could attempt to get the attention of my parents or my elementary school principal, neither of whom would do anything but laugh at me. 2. i travel back in time to september 9, 2001 and it's my current adult self. i could attempt to get the attention of my local police station or news channel, neither of whom would do anything but laugh at me. either way, it seems that if i were to invent a time machine and travel back 22 years, there's nothing i could actually do to prevent 9/11. even if i somehow made it to the world trade center and pulled the fire alarms to evacuate the skyscrapers, that wouldn't stop any of the people on the four planes from dying. so how could an ordinary person convince the authorities to stop the hijackers from boarding the planes without any evidence? i feel like, even today, if i could predict a terrorist attack a few days into the future, there's nobody i could talk to who is powerful enough to do anything about it.",NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/16ef0pw/if_i_traveled_back_22_years_whom_do_i_have_to/,0

16edpas,yikes,"yeah this is the sketchiest festival i’ve ever been to. it sucked before the storm even started on day one. the wind picked up with the storm and we literally had to hold the vendors tents down for them. they evacuated due to dangerous weather but then had us stand in line for over four hours to wait for a shuttle. by yesterday none of the vip bathrooms had a/c or running water. the toilets were backing up. the porta johns were cleaner than the vip bathrooms. my ticket was literally $700 and my friends got rockstar which i think ultimately was around $2k a piece. so you’d think we’d at least get early entry (insert laughing emoji). nah. they opened the gates at 11:25 yesterday. aside from all the bands that got cancelled there was a whole list of stuff you were supposed to get with the upgraded tickets, and last minute they decided you actually don’t get anything. you can just go into a different area. i met a guy with general admission who’d been going in for the meet and greets the whole time with no pass. they were just letting him in. so if y’all want a meet and greet don’t spend $300 or the $2k for rockstar (which came with meet and greet). . just walk in. i feel really bad for everyone who travelled so far to come here for this. fortunately our drive was only 9 hours, but i met a lot of people who drove much further. oh. and my quesadilla was $22… but the sign said $16 so make sure you don’t let them scam you. sign_of_the_horns_medium_skin_tone ",Blueridgerockfest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blueridgerockfest/comments/16edpas/yikes/,0

16edfhz,shuttle system is impossible,"logistically, there is literally no way possible to transport that many people on one mode of transportation efficiently. i attended friday and thought i had arrived with a significant amount of time to wait for the shuttle and attend the sets for bands i paid to see. after an hour and a half of waiting in line to get to the shuttle, people were announcing "" the show is cancelled"". because it was rumored and only from people leaving on their own accord, we decided to wait it out. come to find out, they only ""temporarily"" shut down the shuttle due to a ""severe weather alert"". i understand that they were probably trying to be proactive after thursdays debacle and it being a liability/safety issue to transport people with the possibility of having to just evacuate shortly after.(now rumored it was just a ploy to drop numbers due to overselling/overcrowding which is fucking dogshit of them and no mention of refunds due to it) however, during the 4+ hours we waited in the lot, there were no storms, no one inside the venue was aware of what was going on and was never instructed to evacuate, and sets continued to run as scheduled. i finally arrived at 830pm and saw two bands then was smart enough to leave before the end because again, **its literally impossible to move that many people in timely manner.** the lack of communication was the nail in the coffin basically. aside from absolutely zero cell service, the organizers continued to post instagram stories like everything was normal but little to no updates for us waiting to get in. everyone knows crowded areas always have the worst cell service, so there should have been a plan to keep the staff who are offsite actually updated because why even have radios if you're not using them. also, shout out to the staff working the lots for that fucking long in the heat and basically chickens with their heads cut off while constantly being approached for information they literally didn't have. this was my first time attending and i know these fests have a reputation to be so unorganized, but the way it was handled definitely left a bad taste in my mouth, and it wasn't the shitty weed smoke either(seriously get better shit). i want to plan to go again next year once the lineup drops but now i'm super hesitant to do so.

16eay7h,zombies drones are not what you think! & more,"# zombie drones the truth? zombie drones, a confused topic by those who haven't paid closer attention to the smaller details. some assume that zombie drone merely refers to the solver's reviving ability, or regeneration, like how doll came back after dying. that may be true, but the tape recording explains ""improper dismantling"" or something of the sort. this means that the ""zombie drones"" are just a fancy nickname towards those who were improperly disassembled, coming back to life due to a defect in their code. or ""mutation"" as they put it. using a lot of organic terminology when referring to the drones. i wonder if there's something to that given the absolutesolver parasites more techno-organic nature. to summarize zombie drones is the term used towards drones who are improperly disassembled and thus... well, 0.01% chance it appears a worker drone improperly disassembled may come back, and it appears as tessa implies in ep6, a mutation in the code can cause this solver related ability to appear. though it appears to hold varying abilities specific to certain users, but regeneration is it's overall passive ability for any with it, such as disassembly drones and afflicted worker drones. ... # tessa, human, or puppet? [ LINK (link to a tumblr post that sparked this theory o' mine) while i have doubts tessa is controlled or actually cyn in disguise, there are some points to this theory. for one, the solver **can** make realistic holograms, it fooled uzi faking killing her dad after all! whose to say it can't fool the sentinels/dino bots with fake blood? as that tumblr user points out that there are moments where tessa has no blood on her arm/hand... as if... either: **1)** **it's an animation error**. (probably gonna be the most biggest error of the whole show if true lol like how did they miss that?! i can get thad's hand clipping or lizzy's detached arm, in the pilot, and v's face clipping when n was asking her out, and n's face clipping again when he asked v not to read into that, and a few other nitpicks, but this? this would be quite an error lol) **2)** **it was done on purpose**. (likely? but this is only if it's confirmed to not be an animation error) ""no blood when it's just her and n."" and then suddenly her wrist is bleeding again when uzi and v show up? that does bring up a valid point. they do add small details into the episodes, subtle, but they're there. now there are animation errors, clipping and the like. but stuff's there. >***because v and uzi were in the security camera room***. n was knocked out when tessa was attacked whereas uzi and v might have seen the whole thing. humans are supposed to bleed.but how would tessa know that uzi and v could see her on the security camera system? she was taken first. alice didn't tell beau over the radio that she needed him to come to the security camera room specifically, only that she needed him to bring her more sedatives. the room didn't have a sign saying ""security"" on the door.tessa shouldn't have any suspicion that uzi and v witnessed, or could have witnessed the attack.unless............. this user on tumblr haastera-001 brings up excellent points. they made me think that tessa may have more to her than meets the eyes. as the solver admits to ""assimilating"" which i predicted since episode 2 to be a thing. it can assimilate memories, personalities, whatever of those it takes hold of. it didn't really nail thad right in a hologram, because it didn't yet, you know, assimilate him and stuff (or did it?). cyn? cyn practically became a part of it, as the solver likely assimilated her memories, voice, and otherwise. she was likely the start of it all, or merely the victim of an escaped extension of the solver, from one of the human labs. an experiment gone wrong after all! or her code had a mutation as tessa in ep6 says, maybe the humans didn't do it at all? maybe there's some other entity behind it? jcjenson appears to have been studying the solver, it isn't a far cry that perhaps cyn was infected entirely on accident, or merely, they were just studying the mutated code's effects in others, but that doesn't explain the techno-organic parasites... anyways moving on- ... # nori caused the core ""collapse""! episode 6 answered many questions. such as earth being destroyed as implied by the singularity cyn caused... cyn had fallen completely under the solver's control. as in the present in ep2, the solver acts, nothing like cyn. it can be said that cyn just, changed. but i have my doubts. assimilate? singularity? i won't discard you? the solver's manipulating it's victims to accept it, to become it's host, and it appears to offer it in y/n format. nori, yeva, they all likely had this in some form. the solver appears when one is most desperate, likely. and strikes a deal. they become it's host, and it offers a solution to their problems. or the company is just experimenting with it and it escaped and thus infected cyn who was supposedly dismantled. yet was one of those 0.01% who came back as a ""zombie drone"" because she was improperly disassembled. nori and the others like yeva, were on copper-9, as the labs prove. earth? perhaps jcjenson had labs all over human space. either way, once cyn lost it, she massacred those who caused her and her friends torment. then, the solver would assimilate her completely, and force her to form a singularity to assimilate all of earth itself. at the same time, it sent infected drones, disassembly drones or simply infected worker drones, possibly with those who attempted to evacuate or it merely built the stuff itself, the solver can manipulate matter and form what doll shows replicate things. cyn being quite powerful enough, as the solver likely grew in strength, and to be honest, it looks like the singularity would grow and swallow the manor and eventually, all of earth. it's like the core itself would collapse in on itself, becoming a singularity. and from what tessa implies in ep6, two other planets fell and copper-9 was next, only copper-9, **didn't completely collapse**. nori was shown on camera footage to have been possessed at some point, likely prior to the core's collapse. as alice said made people implode and stuff. like how doll likely did at prom where she showed how you can just, reduce someone to paste, but nori could have likely done it with singularities or similar. khan found nori, after the core collapse i think. he mentioned it like, after i think, and how he didn't notice the collars only that ""your mother was a catch!"" copper-9 i think nearly had a singularity form and completely destroy it as we saw with earth and tessa showed, two other exoplanets or colonies would suffer the same fate. cyn/solver deployed disassembly drones to copper-9, likely after nori, under possession, failed to succeed. as nori likely un-possessed herself, unless she didn't. but i think nori did appear to care for the other worker drones, and likely banishing the solver's influence from her, at least, it's admin privileges... **she wouldn't be able to regenerate anymore. so nori would, canonically, be ""dead""**. or worse, assimilated by the solver recovering her remains after she was killed. solver will not harm other solver infected drones, we saw doll couldn't target v, at least, from the looks of things she tended to avoid harming others needlessly, kind of, but she also had to use other stuff to harm v, she couldn't just grab and crush v, the disassembly drones got the solver in them to, just to a different degree. the solver gives them regeneration, either via the parasite or the code or both. same goes for those like doll, uzi, nori and the like. we saw what the singularity ultimately does, destabilizes the planet's core, black hole. or it just spawns a black hole that eventually consumes the world. either way, nori, i believe, was about to do so, but fought back control over herself and managed to stop it just in time to only... destroy all life on the planet. but hey you win some you lose some, the planet didn't crack like egg and that's a plus! of course, she saw, while under possession likely, some memories or plans the absolutesolver/cyn had. it would send the ""sky demons"" or disassembly drones... and it appears nobody believed nori, yet she held a bit of uzi's personality, a want to save the world, protect folks and whatnot. like uzi, despite being all angsty and emo, ultimately doesn't really want to murder any worker drone, she's annoyed with some of them sure, but she doesn't wish anything bad to happen. heck she even locked herself in the cabin, as to not be a threat to anyone. until rebecca was dumb and got in. like damn uzi really be trying so hard to keep everyone safe from her mental breakdown into solver insanity and then rebecca just has zero iq. so nori likely, knew she didn't have the regeneration anymore, or not. depends. either way she'd decide to face the disassembly drones when they arrive... nori would die during the arrival of the disassembly drones. likely overwhelmed by sheer numbers and firepower. disassembly drones, **can be extremely fast and agile when they are in the murderous mood**. the solver powers, while versatile, and while nori seemed very skilled with it, more than any other. possibly a match for cyn if not greater... then again i think cyn became essentially assimilated by the absolutesolver itself, like how liam's sstwl left hand parasites work, they eventually assimilate the memories, the personality of their host. technically, it's not the same person anymore, only a parasite puppeting them using their memories and body to act like the person, but they're not. anyways back on track, nori could not just squash the disassembly drones with the solver, it'd not allow her to. so she'd have to focus and get creative... but focusing on 3-9 disassembly drones going all out? do you really think nori could possibly win against that much? i mean, if they went all out, i'm sure she put up a good fight but ultimately the disassembly drones **if smart would drench her with nanite acid to counter the regeneration if she still had it, if not, then nanite acid would be extremely horrible of a fate regardless and a painful way to die especially if stung in someplace other than the hand, like the torso or head**. it's a slow acidic burning, i'm sure khan was merciful putting her out of her misery then. likely traumatized khan no doubt. i have no doubt he likely has ptsd in some form. most of liam's works kind of got that kind of stuff. trauma for everyone! but yeah i think nori, as tessa showed in that one security recording, was possessed at one point... and appeared to be one of the strongest solver users yet... and how the solver wants a singularity to form ultimately as it's final goal for a planet? yeah... nori likely nearly caused copper-9 to go boom for the solver that possessed her. we saw uzi could get possessed by the solver and unable to reign back in control. but her mother seemed more... in control of herself unlike the others who went insane or damaged themselves. but hey, that's just a theory. what do ya'll think about it? ...

16e9oq2,have you ever had a prepping related dream?,"i don’t even know where to start with this. i had a dream last night. in the dream, there was a wild fire at my family homestead in the southern appalachian mountains. the fire had already burned around our house, so we felt we were relatively safe in the “black.” the road, which is a normal country road with one lane in each direction, was choked with traffic. i guess people evacuating. suddenly there was screaming and people running and saying the fire blew up. i remember i kept telling people we were safe where we were but there was a massive, panicked crowd, and chaos set in. the first time i had this dream, i remember getting my ass whooped by someone i went to high school with. face_with_tears_of_joy it was like fighting bruce lee face_with_tears_of_joy i woke up, got up for a sip of water, went back to bed, and proceeded to drop right back into the same dream in the same place. this time, when the panic started, i fired off a wild and ill advised round. just before i woke up, i remember my high school best friend telling me that i’d killed his non-existent brother. i’m rattled af, and now i’m thinking about how well we’re prepared for similar situations. we don’t normally get wild fires in our area, but we did have a small one about a decade ago. makes me worry if the forests are full of fuel and we’re sitting on a tinder box. the unrealistic part of the dream was the number of people in the area. we’ve got crazy low population density and i don’t feel like our road would be a primary evacuation route. i guess my question is… have y’all ever had dreams like this? that got you thinking about scenarios you hadn’t prepared for?",preppers,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/16e9oq2/have_you_ever_had_a_prepping_related_dream/,0

16e7yul,the sound of scarabs,"it was a little past seven o’clock, and we had just closed up *eve’s eden of esoterica* for the night. genevieve had seen off her evening class and was counting the till, i was going over my schedule for the next day, and charlotte was facing the shelves in the front lobby. i was beginning to glance anxiously at the front door, wondering if our after-hours appointment was going to show up. none of us had met him before, but a friend of ours had, and she had told us that he might be able to help explain a bizarre and possibly extremely dangerous [artifact]( LINK that had recently come into our possession. i sighed softly with relief when we heard him strike the door knocker four times in a row, not evenly spaced but rather in the rhythm of two twin heartbeats. “that’s him. that’s the signal rosalyn told him to use,” i said, getting up from my seat in the parlour and heading for the door. genevieve protectively took her place behind me to dissuade our guest from causing any trouble, and charlotte excitedly scurried up beside us to see if he matched the description that rosalyn had given him. i opened the door, and was greeted by the peculiar sight of a short and lean dark-haired man dressed in a three-piece tweed suit and proffering a drink tray filled with the distinctive bamboo cups from the *round table co-op café* down the street. “ms. romero insisted i bring these, in retaliation for me using her as a delivery driver during our first encounter,” he explained apologetically, evidently fully aware of how ridiculous he looked. “professor sterling, welcome,” i smiled, reaching out to relieve him of the coffee. “thanks so much for coming. i’m samantha, and this is evie and lottie. girls, this is lucretius sterling; professor of arcane studies at avalon college.” “rosalyn was right. he does look like doctor who,” charlotte whispered, though not quietly enough for him not to hear her. “ah, she said he looked like ‘the best doctor who’, and he doesn’t look like jodie whittaker to me,” genevieve objected. “oh my god. you are just being a troll now. i know you’ve never even seen the show,” charlotte replied. “if whittaker’s your personal favourite, that’s fine, even if it’s solely because she’s the only woman to play the character, but by no objective criteria is she the best doctor. david tenant is the most talented actor to ever play the doctor, he’s the clear fan favourite, he's the best looking, and once the bbc talks disney into leasing them their deepfake luke tech, they’re probably just going to slap his face on every actor who plays him until the end of time. he’s already the doctor so nice he regenerated into him thrice, so why not? samantha, you’ve seen doctor who, right? back me up.” “i’ve… actually never seen a whittaker episode, so i can’t comment on her performance,” i admitted. “i stopped watching a couple of episodes after clara left, since i never really cared for capaldi and once clara was gone there was nothing keeping me invested. amy’s my favourite companion, so i do like matt smith as the doctor, but he’s too zany for when they want to do anything serious with him. of the doctors i’ve seen, tenant’s performance is definitely the best.” “is that settled then? we’ve got that out of the way now? are we good?” sterling asked, crinkling his nose slightly. “yes, i’m sorry. you’re probably sick of people saying you look like doctor who,” i apologized, stepping aside to let him through. and to clarify, he looked like david tenant (the best doctor). “one minute there, professor spacetime. before you come in, you should know that i have protective wards placed on this house,” genevieve warned him. “if you try to harm us or mean us harm, that ill will is redirected back towards you.” “does… ill will include disagreeing with you on who the best doctor who is?” he asked cautiously. “…maybe,” she shrugged. he nodded in understanding and, after a moment of consideration, stepped across the threshold. “ah yes. i feel them now,” he said, scrutinizing the subtle ethereal sensations as they washed over him. “these are remarkably strong and stable, drawing down strength from the higher realms of the astral plane. a dead witch made these, didn’t she?” “my great aunt evelyn. she carved the runes and laid the salt into the very foundations of the house. she rests now on the isle of maidens in the summerland, and her blessings help keep me and our home safe,” genevieve replied. “you’re sibylline witches, then?” sterling asked, his tone implying it was a foregone conclusion, but that it was best just to make sure. “of course,” genevieve nodded, visibly straining to hide her offence at the question. “ah, we are?” charlotte asked. “we are,” i said. “the sibylline sisterhood refers to the informal network of gifted women that’s existed for time beyond memory. it’s not offensive, but it’s also not a term we use ourselves very much.” “outsiders use the term to distinguish us from those they call ‘baphometic witches’, a distinction we don’t need to make because women who serve baphomet are *not* witches,” genevieve added. “real witches worship the threefold goddess and use our knowledge and gifts to help others and fight injustice. any woman who serves malevolent spirits for her own selfish reasons isn’t worthy of being called a witch.” “apologies. didn’t mean to touch a nerve, there,” sterling said as he made his way into the parlour. “it was probably an unnecessary question anyway. your décor here definitely screams new agey empowerment and wellness, not ‘may our dark lord lay waste to our enemies and reign over an epoch of antinomy and bloodshed. ave satani,’. the earl grey tea is mine, by the way. the rest are all oat milk pumpkin spice lattes.” he loudly cleared his throat as he puttered about for a moment, and i got the impression he was deliberating whether or not to simply move on to the reason he had come here in the first place or if more idle preface was needed. “would you like to see it, professor sterling?” i asked bluntly. “absolutely!” he replied enthusiastically, with no need to ask me to clarify. i nodded, and gestured for him to sit down at the parlour’s table. i sat down across from him, setting down the coffees on the window sill and pulling out a small hexagon-shaped jewellery box, locked and carved with sigils to ensure what was kept inside remained there. i opened it slowly to reveal the otherworldly entomological specimen contained within. it was a type of scarab beetle, about an inch long with a shiny, iridescent carapace that sparkled like sunlight off the ocean. sterling eagerly pulled out a monocular magnifying glass from his pocket and began to inspect it. “you read my account of how i acquired this?” i asked. “i did,” he replied. “you astrally projected yourselves to a flea market on an alien world and found these little guys living in the dunes outside. despite the lack of any physical travel, one of them managed to stow away back with you, though it doesn’t appear to have survived the trip. you’ve never seen it move?” “no, but it hasn’t decayed either. i’m terrified that it may just be dormant,” i confessed. “the flea market was swarmed by these things because of me. if this one’s still alive and can reproduce, it could be a devastating invasive species.” “understandable. are you aware of the dreadfort facility up north?” he asked. “they contain things a lot worse than eldritch entomorphs, and i have some contacts with them.” “i’ve come across the name on the harrowickhallows.net forums, but that’s it. i don’t know anything definitive about them, and certainly not enough to entrust them with something like this,” i replied. “i’m not giving this away, at least not tonight, so don’t try to steer our conversation in that direction. you’re here for an appraisal and consultation, nothing more.” “i was just making a suggestion,” he said, putting away the monocle and pulling out a device the ophion occult order refers to as a parathaumameter and started taking readings. “hmmm. from a metaphysical standpoint, it’s definitely dead. it is, however, completely intact, and its exoskeleton seems to have a rather high thaumic capacity. if it absorbs enough of the right kind of astral energies, it probably could reanimate. please tell me you’re not keeping it out in that [hallowed cemetery]( LINK you’re so fond of.” “she’s not, don’t worry. we’re keeping it here,” genevieve assured him. “not only did my great aunt bless this house, but my evil great great grandfather built it with lots of hidden nooks and crannies to keep his darkest and most valuable secrets safe. that bug is every bit as safe here as it would be in dreadfort.” “but enough about our specimen for now. i want to see yours, doctor,” i said. “er, professor. sorry.” he gave a half-hearted nod of forgiveness before reaching into his pocket. he pulled out a marble-sized orb of crystalized, bluish-green ichor. it was glowing, shrouded with a nebulous, pulsing aura. inside i could see a rotating pupa, marked with a strange sigil that i had never seen before. “so, to review the provenance: i got this from ivy noir via rosalyn romero in order to study it,” he explained. “ivy got it from mary darling as an apology for her attempt to kill her sister, and the darlings claim to have gotten a purse full of the things from a [realtor]( LINK “i’m sorry, a realtor?” charlotte asked. “that’s what they called him. he wanted to buy that pocket universe they call their playroom off of them,” sterling replied. “he tried to make them an offer they couldn’t refuse, and they refused by feeding him to their pet abyssal sea serpent. pool noodle, i believe they call her.” “well, they’re not out of hot water yet,” i said. “at the flea market, we met a strange being called mathom-meister who wants to see the darlings brought to justice for their crime against his kinsman, and he’s teamed up with emrys to do it. rosalyn had a vision of these people [killing their own god]( LINK and their flea market was made from the corpse of a scarab titan. to put it mildly, i’m concerned that they might pose a bit of a threat. have you been able to learn anything more about this race of planeswalkers since rosalyn gave you that orb?” “i’ve been able to coax a few more visions out of it, yes,” he replied. “as near as i can tell, they are just planeswalkers and not expansionists or conquerors. they walk between worlds, either alone or in small expeditions, mainly to expand their knowledge, taking only those few rare objects or locations that meet their lofty criteria of ‘worthy’. they don’t want our world, and they want very little of what’s in it. for now, at least, i believe that mathom-meister is only interested in the darlings.” “what about the orb itself?” i asked. “have you been able to confirm if it’s actually ichor?” “oh, absolutely. this is the blood of a titan incarnate. there’s no doubt about that,” he replied. “more importantly, its power is completely self-contained, and not emanating from any divine source, incarnate or otherwise. that means that the god this came from is dead. their god is dead, their god remains dead, and they have killed him. must they not now become gods, simply to appear worthy of the deed?” “don’t quote nietzsche in my house,” genevieve ordered him. “i wasn’t quoting nietzsche. i was paraphrasing nietzsche,” sterling objected. “no nietzsche,” genevieve insisted. “evie, these things have killed at least two gods. allusions to nietzsche aren’t unreasonable,” i said. “while we’re on the topic, we still need a proper name for them. ‘zarathustrans’ seems as good a name as any, don’t you think?” “what’s wrong with squid wizards?” charlotte asked. “it lacks gravitas. a race of god-killing, dimension-hopping sorcerers needs a name with some oomph to it,” sterling replied. “i vote for xarathustrans, but with an x.” “why?” i asked. “no, x. when does y ever make a zed-sound?” he asked, and i had no idea whether or not he was joking. “fine, you can call them zarathustrans and spell it even more pretentiously than it sounds,” genevieve relented. “now can we please focus on the orb? have you been able to get any sort of use out of it for anything other than visions?” “no. i wasn’t even able to chip a sample off for analysis,” he lamented. “i’m fairly certain that if you could revert this to its liquid form, imbibing it would imbue you with a fraction of the dead titan’s power. as it is now, swallowing it just leads to it coming right out the other end unscathed. don’t ask me how i know that.” “we’re smart girls. i think we can guess,” genevieve winced in disgust, pinching the bridge of her nose. “so nothing you’ve done, including… *that*, has been able to break or melt the orb?” i asked. “not a thing. my best guess is that it might be susceptible to some kind of humour-based alchemy or thaumaturgy, but well beyond anything that i’m capable of,” he speculated. “i can’t get a good look at the pupa inside, and i have no idea if it serves any sort of purpose or if it’s just decorative.” “but you think it might be the pupa form of the scarabs we encountered?” i asked. “their thaumatological readings are very similar, and a cursory visual inspection suggests it’s at least within the realm of possibility,” he said thoughtfully. “you combine that with the fact that you encountered the scarabs at a location owned by one of only two xarathustrans we have any knowledge of, and it does seem a little too much to just be a coincidence.” “you said that the scarab could resurrect if it could absorb enough of the right astral energies. what if that’s what the ichor is for? to bring the pupa back to life?” genevieve suggested. “you said the squid wizards used these as money. what if that’s so that they can get them circulating and scattered amongst the occult societies of worlds they take an interest in? these things could be trojan horses.” “but mathom-meister wasn’t able to control the ones at the flea market. everyone had to either evacuate or hunker down when they started swarming,” charlotte objected. “maybe those ones were wild. our scarab doesn’t have a sigil on it, does it? the pupa does. maybe that’s how they control it,” genevieve replied. “professor, may i use your magnifying device?” i asked, pulling out my book of shadows. “i’d like to copy down that sigil.” “by all means,” he said, handing it over to me. “don’t worry, i sanitized it thoroughly after its… digestive detour. it’s occurred to me as well that the pupas might be intended to hatch at some point. the problem with the theory of them being some kind of sleeper weapon is that we know the darlings still have some of these in their possession, and that mathom-meister is actively pursuing the darlings. if he could control or trigger them remotely, he probably would have.” “the core of the sigil is a z stylized to look like an hourglass,” i commented as i drew it down. “there are seven signs inside; three at the bottom upper half, three in the bottom lower half, and one in the top lower half to indicate the flow of time. the signs are all spirals, none of them are identical, but all seem to be reminiscent of grains of sand. i saw the scarabs burrowing into the sand at the flea market. it seems logical enough that that’s where they would pupate. maybe the zarathustrans dug these up from the sand and preserved them in ichor, with the sigil allowing them to reanimate if they were ever returned.” “that’s an interesting idea. i would have liked to use the sigil sand at pendragon hill to see if it would’ve absorbed any of the ichor’s energy, but given the situation, it’s completely off-limits,” sterling explained. “i don’t have access to any other source of sigil sand, and i doubt that just tossing it into regular sand would do anything at all.” “what about witches’ salt? did you try that?” i asked. “…baphometic witches’ salt,” he admitted with a bit of trepidation. “so ‘no’, then,” genevieve said flatly. “i buy most of my paranormal provisions off of mothman, and he’s not the sort sibyllic witches normally do business with,” he explained. “orville’s even worse for quality and legitimacy, so i wouldn’t even know where to –” he was cut off by the sound of genevieve plopping down a two-ounce glass jar of witches’ salt that she had barely even had to stand up to get. “made it myself under a new moon with the ashes of willow branches from samantha’s cemetery,” she said proudly. “it doesn’t get any more authentic than that.” stirling picked it up and examined it closely, first taking back the monocle and then scanning it with the parathaumameter, before finally uncorking it and taking a deep sniff. “it does smell like burnt willow, with a hint of chamomile,” he murmured. “and you just sell this stuff here, to anyone who walks through those doors?” “charms are popular around here, for obvious reasons, and *eve’s eden of esoterica* has been providing them for over half a century, because real witches use their gifts to help the innocent,” she replied. “place the orb inside the jar. since i hallowed that salt myself, i’ll be able to sense and guide any reaction it might have to the ichor. lottie, please make sure all of the doors and windows are closed just in case that pupa hatches.” charlotte nodded and went to check all the windows and entrances. sterling looked at me for confirmation, and i nodded my assent. with a nervous half-nod, he set the jar down in the center of the table, picked up the orb, and gingerly set it down into the witches’ salt. the initial reaction, though subtle, was immediate. the aura surrounding the orb expanded and became more diffuse, as if the salt were physically repulsive to it. “hmmm. the salt is dispelling the spiritual energies in the orb that are contrary to its own resonance, but it’s not cancelling it out. that’s interesting,” genevieve remarked. “confirmed,” sterling said, looking over his parathaumameter. “none of the orb’s intrinsic properties have been neutralized, i’m just getting a fuzzier reading. it’s still a better result than what i got with the baphometic salt. can we try burying it in the salt, to see if that increases the effect? this might not be a bad way to limit its sphere of influence, if it ever became so inclined to expand it.” genevieve nodded, extending her index finger to gently push the orb beneath the surface. the instant she made contact, the orb’s aura condensed back around it, glowing brightly and levitating it slightly above the salt, preventing it from going any deeper in. “shit!” genevieve shouted as she drew her hand back. “what happened?” charlotte asked. “when i touched it, i increased the flow of astral energy through me into the salt. it enhanced its effect, but that seems to have triggered some kind of countermeasure,” genevieve replied. “again, confirmed. it did not like that,” sterling said. the sigil on the pupa was now glowing an incandescent orange, and the orb was darting around in place, like a roving eye taking in as much information as fast as it possibly could. “oh god, it can see us! can it see us?” charlotte asked. “i don’t know!” sterling replied. “quick, spacetime, cork the jar!” genevieve ordered. “why me?” “you saw what happened when i touched it. you’re the only one here who isn’t a witch,” she insisted. “but if it just makes things worse, then it’ll be my fault, then, won’t it?” “just do it!” she demanded. reluctantly, sterling grabbed the cork and slammed it back down on top of the jar, forcing the orb deep into the salt, sending some of it overflowing before the jar was sealed. the jar was glowing faintly now, the light of the orb still emanating through the grains of salt, its resonance having failed to snuff it out. “it looks like the salt is pushing against the glass,” i noted. “the orb’s still not touching it. it’s just pushing it away.” “ummm… is it vibrating?” charlotte asked. “i think it’s vibrating.” sure enough, the jar had begun to shake. it was barely perceptible at first, but it was getting stronger. “it’s going to blow!” sterling shouted, swiping it off the table and dashing for a nearby wooden chest. “take cover!” as he threw the jar in the chest and started piling anything within reach on top of it to block the shrapnel, genevieve overturned the parlour table and the rest of us took cover behind it. only a few seconds later, we heard the muted sound of the jar exploding. it wasn’t powerful enough to break through the chest, but when it shattered, genevieve let out a cry of pain and fell backwards into my arms. “eve! eve!” i screamed. “no, i’m fine. i’m fine,” she insisted, though she sounded far from it. “it’s just, that when the jar exploded, i felt a wave of something pass through the salt and back through me. something hostile, and otherworldly. something… malevolent.” “ladies. you might want to come see this,” sterling called. he had opened the chest and was standing over it, his face cast in an eerie blue-green light. helping genevieve to her feet, the three of us cautiously crept over to see what was inside. as we approached, we could hear a soft, guttural chanting in our minds, fanatical whispers in some hideous alien tongue. “that’s the rallying cry i heard in the vision where the xarathustrans slayed their god,” sterling told us. “roughly translated, it’s saying ‘no gods, no masters,’.” in the center of the chest sat the orb, its glowing sigil facing upwards as if staring at us in defiance. scattered around it amongst the glass shards from the jar were the grains of witches' salt, only now they were no longer black but the same luminescent bluish-green as the orb. each grain was pulsating in rhythm with the orb, amplifying its power rather than dispelling it. and, with a grim irony, i noticed for the first time that the rhythm was the same as the one rosalyn had told sterling to knock with earlier. four beats, like twin hearts; or the sound [of]( LINK

that had recently come into our possession. i sighed softly with relief when we heard him strike the door knocker four times in a row, not evenly spaced but rather in the rhythm of two twin heartbeats. “that’s him. that’s the signal rosalyn told him to use,” i said, getting up from my seat in the parlour and heading for the door. genevieve protectively took her place behind me to dissuade our guest from causing any trouble, and charlotte excitedly scurried up beside us to see if he matched the description that rosalyn had given him. i opened the door, and was greeted by the peculiar sight of a short and lean dark-haired man dressed in a three-piece tweed suit and proffering a drink tray filled with the distinctive bamboo cups from the *round table co-op café* down the street. “ms. romero insisted i bring these, in retaliation for me using her as a delivery driver during our first encounter,” he explained apologetically, evidently fully aware of how ridiculous he looked. “professor sterling, welcome,” i smiled, reaching out to relieve him of the coffee. “thanks so much for coming. i’m samantha, and this is evie and lottie. girls, this is lucretius sterling; professor of arcane studies at avalon college.” “rosalyn was right. he does look like doctor who,” charlotte whispered, though not quietly enough for him not to hear her. “ah, she said he looked like ‘the best doctor who’, and he doesn’t look like jodie whittaker to me,” genevieve objected. “oh my god. you are just being a troll now. i know you’ve never even seen the show,” charlotte replied. “if whittaker’s your personal favourite, that’s fine, even if it’s solely because she’s the only woman to play the character, but by no objective criteria is she the best doctor. david tenant is the most talented actor to ever play the doctor, he’s the clear fan favourite, he's the best looking, and once the bbc talks disney into leasing them their deepfake luke tech, they’re probably just going to slap his face on every actor who plays him until the end of time. he’s already the doctor so nice he regenerated into him thrice, so why not? samantha, you’ve seen doctor who, right? back me up.” “i’ve… actually never seen a whittaker episode, so i can’t comment on her performance,” i admitted. “i stopped watching a couple of episodes after clara left, since i never really cared for capaldi and once clara was gone there was nothing keeping me invested. amy’s my favourite companion, so i do like matt smith as the doctor, but he’s too zany for when they want to do anything serious with him. of the doctors i’ve seen, tenant’s performance is definitely the best.” “is that settled then? we’ve got that out of the way now? are we good?” sterling asked, crinkling his nose slightly. “yes, i’m sorry. you’re probably sick of people saying you look like doctor who,” i apologized, stepping aside to let him through. and to clarify, he looked like david tenant (the best doctor). “one minute there, professor spacetime. before you come in, you should know that i have protective wards placed on this house,” genevieve warned him. “if you try to harm us or mean us harm, that ill will is redirected back towards you.” “does… ill will include disagreeing with you on who the best doctor who is?” he asked cautiously. “…maybe,” she shrugged. he nodded in understanding and, after a moment of consideration, stepped across the threshold. “ah yes. i feel them now,” he said, scrutinizing the subtle ethereal sensations as they washed over him. “these are remarkably strong and stable, drawing down strength from the higher realms of the astral plane. a dead witch made these, didn’t she?” “my great aunt evelyn. she carved the runes and laid the salt into the very foundations of the house. she rests now on the isle of maidens in the summerland, and her blessings help keep me and our home safe,” genevieve replied. “you’re sibylline witches, then?” sterling asked, his tone implying it was a foregone conclusion, but that it was best just to make sure. “of course,” genevieve nodded, visibly straining to hide her offence at the question. “ah, we are?” charlotte asked. “we are,” i said. “the sibylline sisterhood refers to the informal network of gifted women that’s existed for time beyond memory. it’s not offensive, but it’s also not a term we use ourselves very much.” “outsiders use the term to distinguish us from those they call ‘baphometic witches’, a distinction we don’t need to make because women who serve baphomet are *not* witches,” genevieve added. “real witches worship the threefold goddess and use our knowledge and gifts to help others and fight injustice. any woman who serves malevolent spirits for her own selfish reasons isn’t worthy of being called a witch.” “apologies. didn’t mean to touch a nerve, there,” sterling said as he made his way into the parlour. “it was probably an unnecessary question anyway. your décor here definitely screams new agey empowerment and wellness, not ‘may our dark lord lay waste to our enemies and reign over an epoch of antinomy and bloodshed. ave satani,’. the earl grey tea is mine, by the way. the rest are all oat milk pumpkin spice lattes.” he loudly cleared his throat as he puttered about for a moment, and i got the impression he was deliberating whether or not to simply move on to the reason he had come here in the first place or if more idle preface was needed. “would you like to see it, professor sterling?” i asked bluntly. “absolutely!” he replied enthusiastically, with no need to ask me to clarify. i nodded, and gestured for him to sit down at the parlour’s table. i sat down across from him, setting down the coffees on the window sill and pulling out a small hexagon-shaped jewellery box, locked and carved with sigils to ensure what was kept inside remained there. i opened it slowly to reveal the otherworldly entomological specimen contained within. it was a type of scarab beetle, about an inch long with a shiny, iridescent carapace that sparkled like sunlight off the ocean. sterling eagerly pulled out a monocular magnifying glass from his pocket and began to inspect it. “you read my account of how i acquired this?” i asked. “i did,” he replied. “you astrally projected yourselves to a flea market on an alien world and found these little guys living in the dunes outside. despite the lack of any physical travel, one of them managed to stow away back with you, though it doesn’t appear to have survived the trip. you’ve never seen it move?” “no, but it hasn’t decayed either. i’m terrified that it may just be dormant,” i confessed. “the flea market was swarmed by these things because of me. if this one’s still alive and can reproduce, it could be a devastating invasive species.” “understandable. are you aware of the dreadfort facility up north?” he asked. “they contain things a lot worse than eldritch entomorphs, and i have some contacts with them.” “i’ve come across the name on the harrowickhallows.net forums, but that’s it. i don’t know anything definitive about them, and certainly not enough to entrust them with something like this,” i replied. “i’m not giving this away, at least not tonight, so don’t try to steer our conversation in that direction. you’re here for an appraisal and consultation, nothing more.” “i was just making a suggestion,” he said, putting away the monocle and pulling out a device the ophion occult order refers to as a parathaumameter and started taking readings. “hmmm. from a metaphysical standpoint, it’s definitely dead. it is, however, completely intact, and its exoskeleton seems to have a rather high thaumic capacity. if it absorbs enough of the right kind of astral energies, it probably could reanimate. please tell me you’re not keeping it out in that [hallowed cemetery]( LINK you’re so fond of.” “she’s not, don’t worry. we’re keeping it here,” genevieve assured him. “not only did my great aunt bless this house, but my evil great great grandfather built it with lots of hidden nooks and crannies to keep his darkest and most valuable secrets safe. that bug is every bit as safe here as it would be in dreadfort.” “but enough about our specimen for now. i want to see yours, doctor,” i said. “er, professor. sorry.” he gave a half-hearted nod of forgiveness before reaching into his pocket. he pulled out a marble-sized orb of crystalized, bluish-green ichor. it was glowing, shrouded with a nebulous, pulsing aura. inside i could see a rotating pupa, marked with a strange sigil that i had never seen before. “so, to review the provenance: i got this from ivy noir via rosalyn romero in order to study it,” he explained. “ivy got it from mary darling as an apology for her attempt to kill her sister, and the darlings claim to have gotten a purse full of the things from a [realtor]( LINK “i’m sorry, a realtor?” charlotte asked. “that’s what they called him. he wanted to buy that pocket universe they call their playroom off of them,” sterling replied. “he tried to make them an offer they couldn’t refuse, and they refused by feeding him to their pet abyssal sea serpent. pool noodle, i believe they call her.” “well, they’re not out of hot water yet,” i said. “at the flea market, we met a strange being called mathom-meister who wants to see the darlings brought to justice for their crime against his kinsman, and he’s teamed up with emrys to do it. rosalyn had a vision of these people [killing their own god]( LINK and their flea market was made from the corpse of a scarab titan. to put it mildly, i’m concerned that they might pose a bit of a threat. have you been able to learn anything more about this race of planeswalkers since rosalyn gave you that orb?” “i’ve been able to coax a few more visions out of it, yes,” he replied. “as near as i can tell, they are just planeswalkers and not expansionists or conquerors. they walk between worlds, either alone or in small expeditions, mainly to expand their knowledge, taking only those few rare objects or locations that meet their lofty criteria of ‘worthy’. they don’t want our world, and they want very little of what’s in it. for now, at least, i believe that mathom-meister is only interested in the darlings.” “what about the orb itself?” i asked. “have you been able to confirm if it’s actually ichor?” “oh, absolutely. this is the blood of a titan incarnate. there’s no doubt about that,” he replied. “more importantly, its power is completely self-contained, and not emanating from any divine source, incarnate or otherwise. that means that the god this came from is dead. their god is dead, their god remains dead, and they have killed him. must they not now become gods, simply to appear worthy of the deed?” “don’t quote nietzsche in my house,” genevieve ordered him. “i wasn’t quoting nietzsche. i was paraphrasing nietzsche,” sterling objected. “no nietzsche,” genevieve insisted. “evie, these things have killed at least two gods. allusions to nietzsche aren’t unreasonable,” i said. “while we’re on the topic, we still need a proper name for them. ‘zarathustrans’ seems as good a name as any, don’t you think?” “what’s wrong with squid wizards?” charlotte asked. “it lacks gravitas. a race of god-killing, dimension-hopping sorcerers needs a name with some oomph to it,” sterling replied. “i vote for xarathustrans, but with an x.” “why?” i asked. “no, x. when does y ever make a zed-sound?” he asked, and i had no idea whether or not he was joking. “fine, you can call them zarathustrans and spell it even more pretentiously than it sounds,” genevieve relented. “now can we please focus on the orb? have you been able to get any sort of use out of it for anything other than visions?” “no. i wasn’t even able to chip a sample off for analysis,” he lamented. “i’m fairly certain that if you could revert this to its liquid form, imbibing it would imbue you with a fraction of the dead titan’s power. as it is now, swallowing it just leads to it coming right out the other end unscathed. don’t ask me how i know that.” “we’re smart girls. i think we can guess,” genevieve winced in disgust, pinching the bridge of her nose. “so nothing you’ve done, including… *that*, has been able to break or melt the orb?” i asked. “not a thing. my best guess is that it might be susceptible to some kind of humour-based alchemy or thaumaturgy, but well beyond anything that i’m capable of,” he speculated. “i can’t get a good look at the pupa inside, and i have no idea if it serves any sort of purpose or if it’s just decorative.” “but you think it might be the pupa form of the scarabs we encountered?” i asked. “their thaumatological readings are very similar, and a cursory visual inspection suggests it’s at least within the realm of possibility,” he said thoughtfully. “you combine that with the fact that you encountered the scarabs at a location owned by one of only two xarathustrans we have any knowledge of, and it does seem a little too much to just be a coincidence.” “you said that the scarab could resurrect if it could absorb enough of the right astral energies. what if that’s what the ichor is for? to bring the pupa back to life?” genevieve suggested. “you said the squid wizards used these as money. what if that’s so that they can get them circulating and scattered amongst the occult societies of worlds they take an interest in? these things could be trojan horses.” “but mathom-meister wasn’t able to control the ones at the flea market. everyone had to either evacuate or hunker down when they started swarming,” charlotte objected. “maybe those ones were wild. our scarab doesn’t have a sigil on it, does it? the pupa does. maybe that’s how they control it,” genevieve replied. “professor, may i use your magnifying device?” i asked, pulling out my book of shadows. “i’d like to copy down that sigil.” “by all means,” he said, handing it over to me. “don’t worry, i sanitized it thoroughly after its… digestive detour. it’s occurred to me as well that the pupas might be intended to hatch at some point. the problem with the theory of them being some kind of sleeper weapon is that we know the darlings still have some of these in their possession, and that mathom-meister is actively pursuing the darlings. if he could control or trigger them remotely, he probably would have.” “the core of the sigil is a z stylized to look like an hourglass,” i commented as i drew it down. “there are seven signs inside; three at the bottom upper half, three in the bottom lower half, and one in the top lower half to indicate the flow of time. the signs are all spirals, none of them are identical, but all seem to be reminiscent of grains of sand. i saw the scarabs burrowing into the sand at the flea market. it seems logical enough that that’s where they would pupate. maybe the zarathustrans dug these up from the sand and preserved them in ichor, with the sigil allowing them to reanimate if they were ever returned.” “that’s an interesting idea. i would have liked to use the sigil sand at pendragon hill to see if it would’ve absorbed any of the ichor’s energy, but given the situation, it’s completely off-limits,” sterling explained. “i don’t have access to any other source of sigil sand, and i doubt that just tossing it into regular sand would do anything at all.” “what about witches’ salt? did you try that?” i asked. “…baphometic witches’ salt,” he admitted with a bit of trepidation. “so ‘no’, then,” genevieve said flatly. “i buy most of my paranormal provisions off of mothman, and he’s not the sort sibyllic witches normally do business with,” he explained. “orville’s even worse for quality and legitimacy, so i wouldn’t even know where to –” he was cut off by the sound of genevieve plopping down a two-ounce glass jar of witches’ salt that she had barely even had to stand up to get. “made it myself under a new moon with the ashes of willow branches from samantha’s cemetery,” she said proudly. “it doesn’t get any more authentic than that.” stirling picked it up and examined it closely, first taking back the monocle and then scanning it with the parathaumameter, before finally uncorking it and taking a deep sniff. “it does smell like burnt willow, with a hint of chamomile,” he murmured. “and you just sell this stuff here, to anyone who walks through those doors?” “charms are popular around here, for obvious reasons, and *eve’s eden of esoterica* has been providing them for over half a century, because real witches use their gifts to help the innocent,” she replied. “place the orb inside the jar. since i hallowed that salt myself, i’ll be able to sense and guide any reaction it might have to the ichor. lottie, please make sure all of the doors and windows are closed just in case that pupa hatches.” charlotte nodded and went to check all the windows and entrances. sterling looked at me for confirmation, and i nodded my assent. with a nervous half-nod, he set the jar down in the center of the table, picked up the orb, and gingerly set it down into the witches’ salt. the initial reaction, though subtle, was immediate. the aura surrounding the orb expanded and became more diffuse, as if the salt were physically repulsive to it. “hmmm. the salt is dispelling the spiritual energies in the orb that are contrary to its own resonance, but it’s not cancelling it out. that’s interesting,” genevieve remarked. “confirmed,” sterling said, looking over his parathaumameter. “none of the orb’s intrinsic properties have been neutralized, i’m just getting a fuzzier reading. it’s still a better result than what i got with the baphometic salt. can we try burying it in the salt, to see if that increases the effect? this might not be a bad way to limit its sphere of influence, if it ever became so inclined to expand it.” genevieve nodded, extending her index finger to gently push the orb beneath the surface. the instant she made contact, the orb’s aura condensed back around it, glowing brightly and levitating it slightly above the salt, preventing it from going any deeper in. “shit!” genevieve shouted as she drew her hand back. “what happened?” charlotte asked. “when i touched it, i increased the flow of astral energy through me into the salt. it enhanced its effect, but that seems to have triggered some kind of countermeasure,” genevieve replied. “again, confirmed. it did not like that,” sterling said. the sigil on the pupa was now glowing an incandescent orange, and the orb was darting around in place, like a roving eye taking in as much information as fast as it possibly could. “oh god, it can see us! can it see us?” charlotte asked. “i don’t know!” sterling replied. “quick, spacetime, cork the jar!” genevieve ordered. “why me?” “you saw what happened when i touched it. you’re the only one here who isn’t a witch,” she insisted. “but if it just makes things worse, then it’ll be my fault, then, won’t it?” “just do it!” she demanded. reluctantly, sterling grabbed the cork and slammed it back down on top of the jar, forcing the orb deep into the salt, sending some of it overflowing before the jar was sealed. the jar was glowing faintly now, the light of the orb still emanating through the grains of salt, its resonance having failed to snuff it out. “it looks like the salt is pushing against the glass,” i noted. “the orb’s still not touching it. it’s just pushing it away.” “ummm… is it vibrating?” charlotte asked. “i think it’s vibrating.” sure enough, the jar had begun to shake. it was barely perceptible at first, but it was getting stronger. “it’s going to blow!” sterling shouted, swiping it off the table and dashing for a nearby wooden chest. “take cover!” as he threw the jar in the chest and started piling anything within reach on top of it to block the shrapnel, genevieve overturned the parlour table and the rest of us took cover behind it. only a few seconds later, we heard the muted sound of the jar exploding. it wasn’t powerful enough to break through the chest, but when it shattered, genevieve let out a cry of pain and fell backwards into my arms. “eve! eve!” i screamed. “no, i’m fine. i’m fine,” she insisted, though she sounded far from it. “it’s just, that when the jar exploded, i felt a wave of something pass through the salt and back through me. something hostile, and otherworldly. something… malevolent.” “ladies. you might want to come see this,” sterling called. he had opened the chest and was standing over it, his face cast in an eerie blue-green light. helping genevieve to her feet, the three of us cautiously crept over to see what was inside. as we approached, we could hear a soft, guttural chanting in our minds, fanatical whispers in some hideous alien tongue. “that’s the rallying cry i heard in the vision where the xarathustrans slayed their god,” sterling told us. “roughly translated, it’s saying ‘no gods, no masters,’.” in the center of the chest sat the orb, its glowing sigil facing upwards as if staring at us in defiance. scattered around it amongst the glass shards from the jar were the grains of witches' salt, only now they were no longer black but the same luminescent bluish-green as the orb. each grain was pulsating in rhythm with the orb, amplifying its power rather than dispelling it. and, with a grim irony, i noticed for the first time that the rhythm was the same as the one rosalyn had told sterling to knock with earlier. four beats, like twin hearts; or the sound [of]( LINK

16e35uf,a naked body would be found tied and bound in the attic of a building. months later a japanese national would be killed in a similar manner prompting many to speculate that the cases are connected.,"(both of these cases are very violent and disturbing...which seems to be a theme with these hong kong cases i've found part of why it took me a while to write this was because i'm not as desensitized to cases as i had thought and because due to the nature of these cases, i spent a while trying to figure out how to remain tactful and not accidentally write something offensive and disrespectful. ) on june 6, 1975, a worker tasked with making reservations arrived at his job at the windsor building in tsim sha tsui, hong kong. once he entered the attic he quickly discovered the naked body of a woman and in a panic ran downstairs and informed the watchman of the building who in turn called the police and were led to the attic to begin investigations. the body belonged to a woman estimated to be around 20 years of age and was lying on her back. stuffed in her mouth was a piece of blue cloth with her ankles tied together by blue cloth and her wrists tied behind her back with a towel. there was a large wound on her abdomen and several wounds on her breasts caused by a sharp object. most horrifyingly was a wooden stick inserted into her genital region. police found a torn white bra and a pair of black trousers neatly placed next to the body, not far from the body, there was a torn and ripped pair of women's blue trousers which was likely where the restraints came from. in a gravel pile which was a part of the renovations, police found a brown handbag containing a zenith clothing factory card, a jade pendant, two bank passbooks with a total of 20,000 hong kong dollars, a penny, an umbrella, and a rice kettle. a medical examiner noted several bruises to her neck and that all the wounds and other forms of mutilation were post-mortem with the exception of the insertion of the wooden stick. on the wood surrounding the body, police found blood stains and urine on the wooden floor of the attic and her right hand clenched into a fist making the medical examiner believe that she had suffered some form of a shock before death. the cause of death was a single stab wound to the left side of her chest. the medical examiner placed her time of death as between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on june 5th. no semen was found anywhere near or on her body. police believed the killing to have a personal motive. while investigating a man named wong kuen-tse approached the police to report his wife missing. his wife was 25-year-old tam yuen-han and was employed as a labourer at a garment factory. while on duty an electrical fire had broken out at the factory and caused a power failure on that street. the factory was evacuated while firefighters extinguished the blaze and crews worked to restore power. once the fire was extinguished the factory did a headcount and saw that yuen-han was nowhere to be found. as no bodies were found in the building and it was evacuated without injury they all just assumed she went home early and thought nothing of it. the next day kuen-tse figured that when he woke up to see her not around she simply went back to work and only called the police after being told she wasn't there. keun-tse positively identified the body. he told the police that yuen-han had two ex-boyfriends prior to him and that before they got married he had received several threatening phone calls from an unknown man warning him not to ""take my love away from me"". in spite of these threats, the two got married and unsurprisingly the threats still continued. the police's main suspect was this mystery caller so they questioned yuen-han's family about her prior romantic partners. one of the two was very close and assumed they would get married so he was not happy when yuen-han had to move away which in turn ended the relationship. the couple also received several other phone calls from former boyfriends who instead of threatening them were rather begging and pleading for her to take them back. the police reasoned that one of the callers killed yuen-han in a crime of passion and began efforts to track down and identify them. the police searched through phone call records and tracked down all 4 of the former boyfriends. the one who made the most threatening was a man named tong lam. lam lied to the police about his feelings and claimed that he lost interest after yuen-han got married. his alibi is that he was in macau doing business with his goldsmith boss. the macanese authorities confirmed this alibi leaving the hong kong police with no more suspects. in 1976 the police issued a reward of 10,000 hong kong dollars for anyone with information. years later the police then remembered another case which happened after yuen-han's murder and wondered if they were connected. on september 2, 1975, a japanese national and engineer worked at the desalination plant of hong kong's castle peak lok arrangement (cpla). he arrived home to find that his wife 27-year-old keiko inari wasn't waiting for him at the front gate. he could still hear the sound of his baby daughter crying from outside which made him nervous. upon entering the house he found the lights were already on. he heard the sounds of his baby crying and headed towards the room turning on the lights which is when he found keiko's body. on the floor was a blood trail which led to keiko's body lying down on her back on the floor. her hands and feet were spread out in a ""zigzag pattern"" and was only wearing her shirt with nothing underneath with her breasts and lower body bloodied. the police arrived to begin their investigation. the cause of death was evident as the police found a green scarf wrapped around her neck causing strangulation to be listed as the cause of death and lying next to keiko's body was her underwear. after examining the room the police observed that there were two coins on the carpet at the entrance, two pillows on the floor of the hall which were originally from the bedroom, and several books had fallen from the bookshelf indicating that a fight and struggle had taken place. although the cause of death was strangulation, keiko had been attacked prior to that due to how bloodied she was. in spite of this, no weapons were found at the scene and the only thing that was a japanese language newspaper the couple had delivered at 9:00 a.m. every morning. the police reasoned that the killer likely wrapped the bloody weapon in this newspaper to sneak it out of the home unnoticed. the police then searched the entire room and found that three watches worth 3,000 hong kong dollars were missing. these items were likely stolen in order to stage the crime as a robbery. a pathologist called to the scene ruled that the wounds to her body were likely inflicted by a surgical scalpel. there were 21 wounds on the left breast and 18 on the right with the deepest wound being 4 inches. both of her nipples were also cut with the cuts being in the shape of a cross. the wounds to her lower body were also focused and centred on her genitals with one from her genital region and cut down to her anus. the killer had also shaved pubic hair after death before cutting her genital area several times with 30 wounds. no semen was found on her body and the wounds were believed to be inflicted post-mortem. the cause of death was listed as strangulation which likely happened at 3:00 p.m. that same day. based on the brutality the killer was reasoned to be a sadist and likely knew keiko. that had the potential to narrow down the suspect list considerably. keiko had been living in hong kong for a year and couldn't speak cantonese or understand others when they spoke it. keiko also couldn't speak any english which meant that any conversations she held would be in japanese which also meant that the only way someone could actually truly know her would be if they spoke or understood japanese. the area she and her husband lived in was mei foo sun chuen and it was chosen due to the proximity to her workplace and a large number of japanese expats and that the killer at least to the police was likely one of them. the police questioned other residents of the apartment and a maid told the police that at 2:00 p.m. she heard a loud argument between a man and a woman. as the argument was in japanese she couldn't understand what it was about and didn't report it. at least she thought, she couldn't verify that it was in japanese just that it wasn't english or cantonese. the man she was arguing with was named itoda (not his real name). itoda was from tokyo and worked at a local department store. itoda and his wife lived in the same apartment block and knew keiko and her husband. itoda was known to be a sex fiend (no mentions of if he had a criminal record for sex crimes) and inside his home numerous hardcore and abusive pornography and erotic magazines. itoda was also known to be a frequent client for prostitutes in hong kong. ten days before the murder itoda's wife returned to tokyo leaving him alone which is why investigators thought he may be guilty. after obtaining a warrant they searched his home where they found all the pornography mentioned above with some of the tapes even being recordings of itoda and his wife having sex. itoda was arrested and interrogated by officers who knew japanese and even attempted to coerce him into a confession. itoda denied any involvement and soon requested help from the japanese consulate with itoda later being released due to a lack of anything tying him to the crime. police issued notices to all pawn shops in hong kong and macau with pictures of keiko's stolen property and told them to be on the lookout for anyone bringing those items in. the case became a sensation in both hong kong and japan with it being reported for days and the japanese consulate putting pressure on the hong kong police and aiding them in the investigation. not long after keiko's husband left hong kong and returned to japan with his daughter. itoda's reputation was tarnished due to the whole case and soon left hong kong and moved to mainland china where he married a local chinese woman and opened his own business there after divorcing his wife. keiko's murder went unsolved until as mentioned above police, years later, began to look at both keiki inari and tam yuen-han's murders as possibly being connected due to a similar m.o. police also believed that the killer may actually be a woman and that she had accomplices worked with her. even with the possible connection, both murders remain unsolved. ***sources*** [*** LINK

""because a bullet to the head is quick and painless. meanwhile, burning to death is widely considered one of the slowest and most painful ways you can die on my planet."" &#x200b; okay that one really sobered him up. he even seemed to balk. ""what?! predators don't feel pain! predators don't feel anything!"" &#x200b; **well look who's an expert all of the sudden.** &#x200b; *should i even dignify that with a response?* &#x200b; i let out every bit of fatigue i could muster into one sigh.

""you know, you don't have to stay up to make sure i make it back."" &#x200b; *oh no you don't.* &#x200b; ""nonsense. i'm happy too. you know that the exterminators have been out in force at these late paws. ever since-"" &#x200b; ""i moved into town?"" he interrupted. &#x200b; i took a breath. ""ever since the extermination fleet over earth was destroyed."" &#x200b; ""it's not like we asked those child-eating monsters to help!"" &#x200b; i knew that detail of the battle was particularly grating for him. out of all the species to come to the humans aid, it just had to be the arxur. it was almost poetic in a way. it wasn't just that though. ""child-eating."" i felt the venom in michael's voice. he'd become quite fond of my son, tohba. seeing the two of them together was always the most adorable thing. it was another reason i loved having michael here. it was like having a second son who'd just returned home from university. i'm sure the thought of anything harming tohba terrified him. it certainly terrifies me. &#x200b; ""anyways. i'm gonna turn in for the paw. thanks for the tea, tey."" &#x200b; **he's still holding something back.** &#x200b; i started to get up after him.

16e2qix,predictive analytics: how data science is revolutionizing forecasting,"imagine you're planning a weekend getaway, and you want to know the weather forecast. you don't rely on a crystal ball; instead, you check your weather app. that app is powered by predictive analytics, a super-smart way of using data to predict the future. predictive analytics is like a wizard that looks at past data (like past weather patterns) and uses it to tell you what's likely to happen next. it's not just about telling you it'll be sunny; it can even say, ""hey, there might be a thunderstorm in the evening."" it's all about making educated guesses about what's coming up. forecasting is something we all do daily in various ways. when you plan your budget for the month, you're forecasting your expenses. when a teacher predicts how her students will perform on a test, that's forecasting too. it's everywhere, helping us make decisions and be prepared. &#x200b; LINK # data science: the catalyst of change * now, here's where data science comes into play. think of data scientists as detectives who search for clues in tons of data. * they use fancy tools and computer magic to find patterns. with these patterns, they build models that say, ""based on what happened before, here's what's likely to happen in the future. * in this article, we'll take you on a journey through this fascinating world of predictive analytics. we'll explain how it works, where it's used (like predicting diseases or stock prices), and even talk about the challenges it faces, like keeping your data private. * predictive analytics is like having a wise friend who can give you hints about what's around the corner. it's not about magic; it's about using data and science to make better decisions and understand the future. stick with us to explore this exciting world where data helps us see into the future. # role of data science in predictive analytics data science is a bit like being a detective or a scientist. just like sherlock holmes uses clues to solve mysteries, data scientists use data to uncover hidden insights and make predictions. they're the brains behind the scenes, making sure predictive analytics works like a charm. * the data-driven detective work: imagine you're trying to figure out who ate the last piece of cake in your fridge. you might check for fingerprints, and crumbs, or even ask your family members for alibis. data scientists do something similar but with data. they collect, clean, and analyze data to find clues that can help make predictions. * building predictive models: now, here's where the real magic happens. data scientists use these clues to build what are called predictive models. these models are like recipe books for making predictions. they contain all the information on how to use past data to guess what's going to happen in the future. * the power of machine learning: one of the coolest tools in the data scientist's toolbox is something called ""machine learning."" it's like teaching a computer to learn from data, just like you learned from experience. machines can use this learning to get better and better at making predictions over time. it's like training a dog to do tricks but with numbers and algorithms. when you combine data science with predictive analytics, you get a superpower. you can predict not just the weather but also things like which movies you might like on streaming platforms or when a machine in a factory might break down. businesses use it to understand what customers want, and doctors use it to predict health risks. # real-world applications * predictive analytics can help by analyzing past sales, current trends, and even external factors like the weather. * doctors use predictive analytics to anticipate health issues. for example, they can predict who's at risk of developing diabetes based on lifestyle and genetic data. * meteorologists rely on predictive analytics to forecast the weather. by analyzing vast amounts of data from satellites, sensors, and historical patterns, they can tell you if you should grab an umbrella tomorrow. * in the world of finance, predictive analytics helps investors make informed decisions. it analyzes stock prices, economic indicators, and news sentiment to predict market trends. * in disaster management, predictive analytics plays a crucial role. it can forecast natural disasters like hurricanes, helping authorities evacuate people in harm's way. # challenges and ethical considerations * **data privacy and security:** one significant challenge is ensuring that your data is protected. with great predictive power comes a great responsibility to safeguard data from breaches and misuse. * **the bias conundrum:** the quality of predictive models depends on the data used to train them. predictions will also be biased if the data is biased. it is comparable to teaching a parrot to use biassed language; the parrot repeats what it has learned, even though it is incorrect. to ensure fair and just outcomes, it is essential to address bias in predictive models. * **transparency and interpretability:** predictive models can be incredibly complex, making them seem like magical black boxes. but just like a magic trick, people want to know how it works. ensuring that these models are transparent and understandable is a challenge. it's like trying to explain a complicated recipe to someone; it's not easy, but it's necessary. * **accountability and regulation:** with great predictive power also comes accountability. establishing clear lines of accountability and creating regulations is like setting rules for a game; it keeps everyone safe and fair. * **the ethical tightrope:** predictive analytics can be a double-edged sword. it can be used for good, like predicting disease outbreaks, but also for questionable purposes. walking the ethical tightrope is about ensuring that predictive analytics is used responsibly, ethically, and for the benefit of society as a whole. # future of predictive analytics * with the growth of iot devices, predictive analytics will play a crucial role in making sense of the vast amount of data generated by these connected gadgets. it's like having a network of smart assistants that anticipate your needs. * predictive analytics is poised to revolutionize healthcare further. we might see personalized treatment plans tailored to an individual's genetic makeup and lifestyle, reducing the guesswork in medicine. it's like having a medical oracle guiding doctors to the most effective treatments. * as predictive analytics becomes more integrated into our lives, discussions around ethics and regulations will intensify. it's like defining the rules for a new sport; we need fair play and referees to ensure everyone's safety. **conclusion** as we conclude our expedition through the world of predictive analytics, we're left with a profound realization that predictive analytics, powered by data science, isn't just a tool; it's a compass guiding us through the uncertain waters of the future. like a well-trained guide, it helps us navigate life's uncertainties. yet, we've also encountered the challenges and ethical considerations that come with this power. data privacy, bias, transparency, and accountability are critical discussions as we tread this path. much like a careful explorer, we must navigate these challenges with responsibility and integrity. if you're eager to explore this world further, consider embarking on a [data science training course in bhopal]( LINK delhi, noida, or any other suitable location to deepen your understanding and contribute to the journey of predictive analytics.",u_kajaldigital87,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_kajaldigital87/comments/16e2qix/predictive_analytics_how_data_science_is/,0

16dz3xz,short story i wrote in 9th grade,"the bean man fresh beans splattered on the pavement. a disturbing sight to some, but this happens every day in a city like this. “you had one job!” “sir i…” “you what? you’re sorry? i came here for beans. give me my beans or give me a refund.” the customer said in his british accent. without another word, the bean man begrudgingly walked to the back of his food truck, the bean machine. after some time, the customer started to wonder what was taking so long. just as he finished that thought, the bean man emerged with something in his hand. the customer had forgotten his glasses that morning so he had to assume it was his money. the bean man extended a hand. “it’s about time.” the customer mouthed out to the crowd that had gathered. he reached out to claim his money, then “splat” the customer hadn’t yet processed what exactly happened. he looked down at his hand… it was covered in beans. a shocked look came over the faces of the bystanders. people were recording and taking photos. the bean man began to fret. then, in a manner that seemed fit for a movie or a short story, the bystanders started clapping. the evil foe had been defeated. the bean man saved the day yet again. the bean man returns home after a long day of serving the community. home to his wife and child. the apron comes off and he’s just a man. no longer the bean man, now a family man. he struggles every day dishing out beans to support his family. the truth is he’s getting too old for this. he glances at his son. he’s served the community so his son could have a better life. he’s a hero to the people as the bean man, but to his son, he’s a hero as a father. “dad! i drew the bean machine!” “huh? oh that’s great son.” his son always wanted to work together dishing out the beans. a robin to this street’s batman. but the bean man knows that the bean life, the life he worked so hard for so his son did not have to do the same, isn’t the life his son deserves. that night the bean man made some beans for his family. “you always make beans.” his wife, cristina, said. “beans are my life. i make beans to support this family.” “you have all the opportunity to get a normal job.” “why would i want a normal job? phil loves the bean man.” “but he loves you just as much! you don’t have to be the bean man. we need money. you went to medical school! you tried hotel management school but you dropped out.” “you want me to be a doctor? i’d barely be home.” “you’re already barely home! it’s this family or the beans!” “i love you cristina. it’s all gonna be ok.” “when?” “soon. i promise.” the next day is a quiet one… almost too quiet. the wind howled like the bean man's son in his werewolf phase. something evil was afoot. the streets were empty. the bean man's usual customers were nowhere to be seen. “bz bz.” the bean man felt his cellular device buzz. he reached into his fanny pack. he had received an urgent message. someone had given a bad review. \*gasp\* the bean man immediately recognized the wrinkly face of the customer. it was the same customer from the day previous. the man whom the bean man had given a refund in the form of beans. “one star. bad service, worse beans.” “who’s this?” the bean man asked the grill operative. “who’s who?” “who’s this?” the bean man handed the phone to his employee. the young employee said “oh, that’s gordon ramsay.” “who’s gordon ramsay?” “you never heard of ‘em? have you seen hell’s kitchen?” “is it on netflix?” “i don’t know. you’d probably know if you’ve seen it or not. he’s a british chef guy. have you seen hell’s ki-?” the bean man gives him a look “oh wait yeah sorry i asked that. have you seen kitchen nightmares or hotel hell or anything?” “wait... what’s hotel hell?” “he just goes to hotels with bad reviews and yells at the employees until it’s a better hotel. apparently he’s not only a chef, he also went to hotel management school.” “huh, that sounds pretty cool. is it on netflix?” “i don’t know man! is netflix the only thing you have?!?!” “i have hulu as well. i don’t really know how to work a roku tv though.” “oh, well i’ve got a roku tv. if you wanna find any of the shows just go to the roku search thing and type in the names of the shows. it shows you if they’re on netflix or hulu or whatever you have.” “what were the names again?” “i’ll just text them to you.” the employee said. by the time he finally stopped talking, the day was over. the bean man went home once again. it was late. his wife was waiting for him. he returned home unaware of how late it had gotten. “it's so late!” his wife said. “i know. sorry. do you know who gord-“ “i had to put phil to bed all by myself!” “i’m sorry honey... i didn’t know how late it was. my employee kept talking about gordon ramsay. do you know who that is?” his wife responded, “it’s ok... i love you so much. i can’t stay mad at you. yeah i know who that is.” “can we watch hotel hell?” “of course we can, honey. good thing phil’s asleep. it’s got some pretty grown up language.” they sit down on the couch. the bean man slowly types “gordon ramsay” into the search bar. results pop up before he can even finish typing the name. “ooh can we watch kitchen nightmares?” said the bean man's wife. “i thought we were gonna watch hotel hell, but we can watch whatever you want, honey.” “we can watch hotel hell if you want.” “no, it’s fine. kitchen nightmares seems interesting.” the bean man clicks on the most recent episode. everything looks suspiciously familiar. gordon walks towards a food truck... it’s the bean machine. the bean man takes a glance at his wife, wondering if she sees what he does. the bean man quickly turns it off. “what was that for?” his wife asks. “oh that was probably a bad episode. i’m getting pretty tired anyways.” “that was the bean machine! you’re famous! i don’t know why you’d be on kitchen nightmares though. maybe they review good food places before they get to the bad ones. did you make sure to serve him your best beans?” there's a long silence. “yeah.” the bean man says. they both head to bed. the bean man can’t fall asleep. “honey?” he says. there’s no response... the bean man sneakily gets out of bed and goes to turn the tv back on. he watches the episode. he sees himself disrespecting gordon ramsay. he feels horrible. he thinks about his son. “dad! i drew the bean machine!” he doesn’t know why his son sees him as a hero when he sees himself as anything but. he slowly falls asleep on the couch with regrets clouding his mind. the bean man wakes up to the sound of his son crying. he puts on his slippers and springs into action! was his son hurt? no. the bean man sensed it was something different. he reaches his son. he asks “what’s wrong?” his son just points out the window. someone spray painted the words “donkey” and “where’s the lamb sauce?” all over the bean machine. it was personal now. “honey!” his wife yelled. her friend had told her all about the episode of kitchen nightmares. the bean man couldn’t hear her over the sound of his own racing thoughts. he walks outside and hops into the bean machine. he slams the door, but today, instead of heading to the usual spot, he heads to hell’s kitchen. “wheres gordon?” the bean man yells as he swings open the doors with a force that could send any enemy headed for the hills. there’s a silence. the diners stare at him, annoyed. “do you have reservations?” asks the hostess “huh? no, i'm looking for gordon.” “gordon who? do you have a party set up? “i’m looking for gordon ramsay. where is he?” “oh… well… we film episodes on mondays and wednesdays.” “it’s thursday! where am i gonna stay?” “you can stay at the ramsay hotel. as you may know, mr. ramsay went to hotel management school. whatever food you order here will be added to your hotel bill.” “ok, yeah… thank you.” “was that a yes?” “yes!” “then can you get out of here? you’re tainting the ambience.” the bean man stormed out of the restaurant and found some teenagers that were taking photos of the bean machine. “get outta here!” the bean man yelled. he wondered if his son could see him now, would he still be a hero in his eyes? he headed to the ramsay hotel. that same thought on his mind as he fell asleep. “you f\*\*king donkey!” what have you done to the scallops?!?! you forgot to… what did he forget to do again?” “cut!” “he forgot to oil the pan when he pan-seared the scallops.” the prompter whispered from behind the camera. “oh yeah.” gordon said. “and hey, sorry if i was a little bit too obnoxious with the yelling phil.” “no, it’s ok gordon. you’re just doing your job.” “gordon!” the bean man barged in. “someone told me you were filming the show today.” back at home phil’s watching tv. “mom! dads on tv! “what?” she walks over to the tv. she sees her husband. she’s mad at him at first for leaving without notice but she sees a look in his eyes. she recognizes that look. now she’s worried. “why don’t you go to your room phil, ok? i think the language is a little too grown up for you.” back in hell’s kitchen, things were getting serious. “yeah i am, and you’re interrupting, so why don’t you take a seat?” “why don’t you take down your review of my food truck and take it off kitchen nightmares?” the tv back home goes to static. “i can’t just take it off kitchen nightmares like that.” “why can’t you?” “unless you give me a good reason, i'm not taking the episode down. i don’t even know you.” “how’s this for a good reason?” the bean man scarily pulls out a gun. the studio audience evacuates. “you recognize me now? you ruined my life. you ruined my son's life.” the bean man said in a shaky voice. “take the episode down!” “security!” the security guards slowly walk towards the bean man. “don’t take a step closer! how about this? let’s have a cook off.” “a cook off? haha.” the bean man gestures with the gun “yeah a cook off. i would stop laughing if i were you.” “ah-” “ah what? you recognize me? i’ve seen you do cook offs on tv before.” “why would i do one with you?” “what other choice do you have?” “ok! i’ll take down the episode and the review if you win. if you don’t, we’ll just see what happens.” the bean man thought about his son and his wife. he’s not a hero anymore even if his son believes it. he hoped they weren’t watching. “why don’t you have some dinner at my house tonight? the food at the ramsay hotel isn’t amazing.” gordon says. “why’d you bring me here?” the bean man asks. “just wanted to show some hospitality. we’re about to have a cook off. what’s wrong? you haven’t touched a bite of your food.” “how do i know it’s not poisoned?” “ha! why would i poison you? i feel confident enough about my cooking abilities to not resort to stuff like that.” gordon said. the bean man takes a bite. “so how’d y-” something was wrong. the food… it was bad. how could he be so confident? “what happens if you lose is you keep quiet. if you speak to anyone about me ‘faking my victory’ i’ll make sure you never speak again. i may have forgotten to tell you this but if you win… not only will the episode be taken down but i will take you down with everything i have. you have one option. lose quietly.” “why shouldn’t i just walk away from this right now?” “it’s too late,” gordon says. gordon handcuffs the bean man to himself. they get in a car. “where are you taking me?” “you should know by now. i’m taking you to hell’s kitchen.” the lights came on. the cameras were pointed at the bean man. it was time. the tv back home turned on. “phil look! your dads on tv.” back in hell's kitchen it had begun. the bean man heard the judge speak the words, “the food challenge is beans.” gordon must not have eaten his beans back then. the bean man was confident. gordon was busy at work lying to the people. the bean man knew beans. he was ready. he puts his beans in a large pot. he adds chilli pepper, cumin, paprika, cayenne. the bean man thinks of his family back at home. he wonders if they’re watching. he wonders what they’re thinking. “dads gonna win!” phil said. the bean man is in action. he moves as swift as a breeze. whoosh! he tosses in some garlic, bay leaves, onion, bell pepper, some salt and pepper. once again, he reaches into his fanny pack. he pulls out a secret ingredient. “ding!” time’s up. the bean man watches gordon present his dish to the chef. it doesn’t even resemble beans. “i like how you utilized every part of the bean. every ingredient compliments another. great beans. gordon” it was time for the bean man to present his beans. he thought about his son at home watching. “here are my beans. i went simple with this. it’s a family recipe. i call it phil’s beans” “mom did you hear that?!?!” “yeah i did honey.” “when dad gets home can we have beans?” “of course we can honey.” “who’s phil?” the judge asks. “my son.” “let’s hope you honor his name with these beans.” the judge takes a bite… “terrible. what’s that sour taste?” “that’s my secret ingredient. i kept my family in mind when making these beans for you.” “well, i think it’s clear who the winner is here. it comes as no surprise but gordon wins!” gordon laughs… but the bean man smiles. he checks out of the ramsay hotel and heads home in a rental car. the bean life wasn’t the life for him nor his son. he comes home to his wife and son asleep on the couch. he carries them both to bed. in the morning. he makes the best beans for the family he loves. no need for secret ingredients. he realizes, beans or not, he’ll always be a hero to his son. he’s no longer the bean man. now he’s just dad.",writers,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/16dz3xz/short_story_i_wrote_in_9th_grade/,0

the original fic (which i can't see on reddit for some reason, i had to get a google docs file of it sent to me.) was a blast to read and i couldn't think of any other way to do it justice. i also couldn't find the name of the og author (again, the fic was sent to me on google docs) so yeah, whoever wrote the og fanfic ya'll are awesome.* \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***memory transcript subject:*** *ian watson, humanity first associate, september 15th, 2140* i was restless; this job was unlike anything i had done before. on the surface, it made perfect sense; we were going to storm the joint un-yotul census office on leirn and steal the bulk of the official population statistical documentation before un reinforcements could arrive. we had a small window of time before the whole building would be surrounded, so we had to be quick, and we had to make sure that we didn’t use force until absolutely necessary. we wouldn’t have time to fool around or play terrorists; this was a top-tier job that came from the upper echelons of the organization. but what irked me was our target; why were we stealing census information? was it to get useful information on pro-un yotul politicians? maybe, but it felt like a very overcomplex and backward way of going about it unless we needed something really specific on a certain politician. was it to see if we could pick out potential recruits from the planetside human population? *maybe*, but it didn’t feel right since the yotul population census was deemed the first priority, and everything else was secondary. i couldn’t quite determine what the overlying motivations of our superiors were, and that rubbed me the wrong way since the boss had always been pretty transparent about what we were supposed to do most of the time; that’s just how heriberto rolled. heriberto genuinely cared about his men, even if he was willing to make sacrifices in the name of humanity, something that the un seemed completely incapable of doing or even considering unless it involved kowtowing to the xenos. as per the plan, i secured a job at the census office and familiarized myself with the layout, especially all the potential paths, and obstacles, leading to the central census database. due to technological advances and how new the building was, only being a year or two old, the building itself was small enough for me to become accustomed to it in only a month, but it was still large enough to pose a decent challenge for anyone not familiar with the layout. at first, a janitorial position felt a bit demeaning, but after a while, i grew a bit fond of it. i had plenty of time to myself, free reign of most of the facility, and a decent paycheck. it was easy for me to form a mental map of much of the facility in my mind when i spent most of my day touching up the facility instead of filing paperwork into a digital format like a lot of my fellow associates. then there was my civilian boss; he could be worse. he was an older yotul with a sly smile and fur that was starting to show its age. he didn’t bother me much, and he was nice enough, but it still rubbed me the wrong way to take orders from a xeno. still, having a yotul for a boss was far from the worst-case scenario, especially with the increasing number of krakotl and gojid refugees settling on leirn. there was no way i’d show any sort of respect to one of those genocidal maniacs, even if they feigned respect or niceties; all they cared about was using us and throwing us away, and i was sure that they would toss humanity in the dumpster and set it ablaze once we weren’t useful anymore. they needed to be broken of their problematic culture and habits before they gained too much influence within the un leadership; lord knows zhao was practically begging for them to walk all over us even after they vaporized the families of so many humans including *my* family. there could be no compromise; humanity needed to be in charge, and these xenos would need to learn some humility, but we could make a few exceptions. the yotul weren’t too bad of a species; the rather disgusting idiosyncrasies of federation dogma hadn’t taken hold yet, so they were actually civilized unlike much of the gentled species that clung to humanity and the un like parasites. they weren’t teeming with racists and xenophobes like the rest of the galaxy, and they actually understood what it felt like to be treated like dirt for simply acting like a normal goddamn sentient. it was no surprise that those psychotic kolshians wanted to kill any kind of yotul counter-culture while it was still in the cradle since the alien marsupials so vehemently held onto their former beliefs. i could respect their tenacity and experiences, so i would respect my boss, who had been nothing but nice to me thus far. i rode the train to work, my janitorial outfit stuffed into my backpack along with any of the gear necessary to break into the central database and of course, my tech-9 and its attachments. sure, it was a pre-satellite wars gun that was woefully obsolete, but we didn’t need anything fancy or modern to get the job done; casualties weren’t the goal here, just a retrieval mission. today was going to be the day; the deadline was closing in and we needed to get this job done before the thirty-first of the month or the job was considered bust. we had two months to prepare, so now it was showtime. a young human mother sat on an edge seat next to me while i stood and held onto an upper handle for support. she was cradling an infant in her arms, who gurgled and giggled at its mother’s face. that was what i fought for, for mothers like her and her children, for the very soul of humanity. i wasn’t like one of those un venlil boy-kissers who was more worried about boning xenos than keeping humanity safe. i turned away from her and looked out the window, watching the partially-modernized cityscape of one of leirn’s bustling cities, chuusa, take shape. it was an awe-inspiring view, one that reminded me of those classic pictures of gilded-age americana that you’d see in a high-school history class, complete with the steel bridges rising across the twin rivers of se’l and su’l, brick buildings reaching ten and twenty stories holding billboards and neon signs, and primitive vehicles zooming through the streets. some of it had been brought up to human standards in the past two years or so since the un occupied the world, but luckily the yotul culture still shined through. i liked it that way; it would be a shame if the un tried to tear down the one good culture in the galaxy that hadn’t been infected by idiocy and xenophobia. eventually, the train reached my stop and i stepped off silently, walking into a massive cobblestone and steel train station, ginormous frescoes and mosaics of scenes from classical yotul history lining the walls. i made my way to a concessions stand i always ate at, operated by the same elderly mustachioed hungarian man, and purchased my usual breakfast for the final time; a big bag of *pogacsa* and a strong cup of coffee. the cream in the coffee was almond-based and the pastries were no doubt vegan, but i was used to disappointment at this point; it seemed that the un would go to extreme lengths to make their own citizens suffer when off-world while simultaneously making sure every xenos that stepped onto earth was as comfortable as possible. typical. i paid the elderly gentleman and tipped him generously, nodding to him with a bright smile. he nodded and waved at me, his face brightening up, his rosy cheeks and cared-for mustache turning upwards as he smiled and thanked me in hungarian, which i didn't speak well. i waved back before making my way out of the ginormous train station and into the light of the early morning sun. it was a beautiful day out, with birds chirping and the trees swaying in the wind. i was oddly at peace today, despite the terrible thing i was about to do. i had no doubt that it was a terrible thing; no matter if the xenos deserved it or not, we were *humans!* we were supposed to be the civilized ones here. but sometimes you had to fight fire with fire, and right now i had a feeling that we were going to pour some gasoline. rolling over and being civilized would only allow the xenos to treat us like dirt and walk all over us some more, taking advantage of our goodwill and empathy while simultaneously treating being as selfish as possible and never changing. they would never change on their own: we would have to make them change. the more i thought about it, the more i realized that the purpose of stealing the census data didn't matter; if it furthered humanity's goals then that's all that mattered. it would be best if i didn't idle on the thought for too long, or it would eat away at me and i'd lose my nerve. i couldn't fail my brother in arms; we had come too far, and we'd done too much together. *he who fights beside me shall be my brother:* that's what heriberto had told me. i wouldn't forsake my brothers, not even if it cost me my life, because i knew they would do the same. *the mission comes first, ian, the mission and your brothers. the moment you swore every fiber of your being to protect humanity was the moment you rendered your life forfeit.* i walked down the steps and onto the street, melding with the crowds of humans, yotul and other xenos, popping my earbuds in my ears and switching on some classic rock to calm my nerves and get me in the mood. to everyone else, i just looked like you're an average young adult, albeit a bit moody, so nobody paid me any mind. the yotul especially treated me like an actual human and not a predator, apologizing to me when they bumped into me and greeting me on occasion. i made an effort to be as nice to them as possible, knowing that i might have to kill some later. *the potential deaths weigh heavy on my heart, but it needs to be done. we have to make sure the higher-ups get this information if it pushes our plans forward.* i crossed the street with the crowd, moving towards the government plaza and the census hall. dozens of yotul and humans moved through the revolving doors, some of which i recognized: i saw charleston, a large african american from atlanta had been on his way to earning an athletic scholarship before he was evacuated. the city wasn't fully destroyed, but his family died when their entire neighborhood was turned into a crater by a falling federation starship. he worked in it, was the one who would be uploading the virus files into the database and could manipulate any built-in security like a wizard. there was xinyi fang, a petite chinese woman who had lost her two sons to the bombing of guangdong. she worked as a receptionist, and despite her harmless demeanor she had killed before and had no qualms with doing so again. she could distract any problematic personnel who might be interested in investigating the employee sections while charleston worked his magic. then there was noboru jirou, but everyone called him *nobody* as per his request; he preferred that name because he always said that must have been what the un saw him as when compared to their new genocidal alien buddies, even when his wife and young daughter were incinerated from the bombing of tokyo. he and a few others had infiltrated security, on account of their former military backgrounds, and would serve as our main muscle if things got hot. in fact, a lot of our members were former military; they fought, bled, and died to protect earth, and watched as their hopes and dreams went up in smoke along with their homes and families. then they were told to sit down and shut up when the same aliens who had tried to turn us into a past tense were suddenly very clingy and friendly when they couldn't rely on the federation to be their protectors from the arxur anymore. but we wouldn't sit down, and they wouldn't shut up. we were going to make the un hurt until they either made changes or showed their true colors, and maybe then the people of earth would hang zhao and his cronies on a noose like the treasonous alien-fuckers they were. i entered the building, and nobody nodded to me, a blank and serious expression on his face as he observed the main lobby from the corner of the room. at his hip was a sidearm and a baton was at his other hip. underneath his blue button-down shirt was supposedly a kevlar vest, as well as some wired explosives just in case things took a turn for the worst. i didn't know how he was able to sneak them into the building, but i learned a long time ago to not question his methods; the man was practically a magician. i had my own vest in my duffle bag, as did the rest of us, but the explosives were nobody's own decision; he had no intention of being captured today. i walked over to nobody and he placed his hands behind his back in parade rest. his uniform was in perfect condition, and his shoes were flawlessly ladder-laced. the man was like a stone statue, unflinching and taciturn in personality, but i quickly learned that he had the coolest head under fire and was a very dangerous man. ""good morning, ian,"" greeted nobody, his voice morose and completely professional, ""how can i assist you today?"" ""are you ready?"" i asked, my voice wavering a bit. ""for work, i mean."" nobody snorted. ""what a silly question: *i am always ready*. now go switch into your uniform and prepare your *cleaning utensils;* there is lots of *dirt* and *grime* to clean today."" i sighed and nodded. having a conversation with nobody was challenging enough on a normal day, but today he was obviously more worried about the task at hand than socializing, and i couldn't blame him. there was a good chance most of us wouldn't be alive by the end of the day. ""good luck, nobody,"" i say, hoping to at least give him some closure. he merely nods, although i do see a slight shift in his eyes. ""and to you as well, ian."" i step away from him and. i walk over to the front desk to clock in and check on mrs. fang. she gave me a bright smile and waved at me, beckoning me to come over and speak with her once she was finished with the people she was helping. i obliged and moved over to her. she was a kind, older lady from guangzhou in her mid-fifties with a dubious past, and she always smelled of anise and dried mandarins from her perfume. she would always bring in lunch for us, since chinese food was one of the few cuisines that i could stomach the vegan alternatives of since they had plenty of traditional vegan dishes to choose from, and always treated her teammates like her grandchildren. still, i knew better than to mistake her for a helpless old woman; she was incredibly dangerous with both the sidearm under her dress and the thin stiletto blades hidden within her hairsticks. we would always try to get her to tell us where she learned to fight, but her answer was always the same; *a lady never tells*. ""it is good to see you, dear,"" mrs. fang said, her bright smile a little bit dimmer today. ""are you ready for the extra work we have today?"" ""i'm always ready for extra work."" ""good, because i don't think i need to remind you that it will be harder than most. do you know your schedule? when do you need to go to meet up with charleston?"" ""after lunch, mrs. fang, we've been memorizing everything for the past month."" she gave me a playful *harrumph* and returned her eyes to her computer, her voice reducing in volume. ""i just wanted to make sure, dear: too many good jobs have been wasted all because someone forgot the plan. and this is a job we *cannot* afford to mess up."" ""i understand that mrs. fang, i really do."" ""good, i'm glad,"" she replied with a small smile. ""also, i have been informed that we may receive extra *coworkers* today to help us with our expanded workload. they should be here after lunch. charleston has been informed to not begin the file upload until then, because we can't risk tripping the alarm until we're ready for unwanted visitors."" i nodded. it was a relief that we were going to get any kind of extra help, considering we would be surrounded by human law enforcement within ten to fifteen minutes once the alarm was triggered. i relaxed a little bit; i could *do this! we* could *do this!* ""thanks, mrs fang."" ""no problem, dear. also, there's a bowl of *cong you ban mian*, *di san xian*, and mushroom *shumai* in the employee fridge with your name on it."" ""i really appreciate you, mrs. fang, i just wanted you to know that."" ""thank you, dear,"" she said with a pained smile before making a *shoo* gesture with her hands. ""now get to work; we've got a lot to do today."" \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it was almost time. we had sat down together in a few small groups in the human break room, which was kept separate from the other break rooms so as to not ‘cause a panic’. it was disgusting, but i kept my mouth shut; i had bigger things to worry about than my frustrations with the stupid xenos and their idiotic justifications for their hateful ways. we shared the food that mrs. fang brought in silence, the air so thick with tension you could practically cut it with a knife. the closer it got to the fated hour, the more i began to feel the telltale sigma of anxiety; shivers, a chilling weakness in my stomach and groin, and cold sweats. i began to twitch here and there, causing my xenos coworkers to become skittish around me like i was about to pounce. well, all of them except for one. my boss, an older yotul by the name of lenjo, didn’t seem perturbed at all, but rather concerned about my wellbeing. he would constantly check up on me as if he was worried that something might happen. he was far too perceptive. i was moving my mop bucket back into the janitorial closet and prepared to take my smoke break out back where there were no cameras so i could begin assembling my gear and preparing for the operation when lenjo surprised me; he moved up behind me far quieter than i ever thought a xeno could and placed his paw on my back in a reassuring way. i nearly jumped out of my skin, but quickly calmed when i noticed it was just him. “i’m sorry ian, i didn’t mean to scare you, i just wanted to check up on you and see if everything is okay.” i gulped nervously, still recovering from my shock. “i-uh… everything’s fine, sir, i’m just feeling a little off today.” “well, if you’re feeling ill you can clock out early and head home; i’ll make sure you’re compensated for sick hours.” no, i couldn’t do that. i had work to do, *real work* to do. “it’s not bad sir, i just need a quick cigarette and i’ll be fine.” lenjo gave me a disapproving look. “you should really stop smoking those, you know: it’s really bad for you.” “just a guilty pleasure, sir, but i’m working on it.” “that’s good to hear son, just go and take your time; most of the important deep cleaning is already done anyway. good job on that, by the way, i’ll make sure you get a raise for all the extra effort you’re putting in.” i swallowed bitterly and looked down as lenjo walked away, completely clueless as to what was happening. lenjo didn’t deserve to have to deal with the absolute mess that was about to occur; he was one of the few xenos, even amongst the more open-minded yotul, that treated me like an individual and not just a ‘filthy predator’. i hoped he would end up unharmed. but his kindness only exasperated why we needed to keep fighting the good fight because we needed to make clear that people like lenjo shouldn’t be exceptions, but rather the rule. i finished putting away my cleaning cart into the janitorial closet and hefted my duffel bag over my shoulder, making my way to the back exit so i could have a quick smoke before prepping to go. i didn't have any cigarettes on me today, but rather a pack of cigarillos: i wanted to puff something a little stronger than a cigarette to calm my nerves. another janitor who was in on the plan, david, joined me out back, and i opened my pack of cigarillos before handing him one, which he lit with his zippo lighter. we stood in silence for a few minutes, appreciating the afternoon sun as we puffed the smoke without inhaling. ""so, this is it, huh?"" he said, sounding a little bored. ""yeah,"" i replied. ""i ain't got much left. you?"" david chuckled bitterly. ""i'm an old fart with a dead family, ian; you've got a whole life ahead of you, and you can do great things with it. if anyone deserves to get out of this mess in one piece then it's you. whatever happens today, make sure that you try and get out once the job is done. you've got so much time left and it'd be a shame to waste it."" ""but people like you and nobody have been around forever! you guys are heroes, you deserve to live your twilight years in peace."" david cackled. ""twilight years, huh? you calling me old son?"" ""maybe,"" i replied, ""but i don't mean that in a bad way. you've all been through hell and back; you deserve a break from this shit. i haven't earned that right yet."" ""i ain't no hero ian, just a plumber from what used to be queens,"" david replied. ""sure, i served a tour or two keeping the peace in guatemala during the third violet revolution back in the day, but i ain't no hero, just a plumber."" he let out another puff of his cigarillo smoke. ""now *nobody*, that's a man with some impressive history."" ""*nobody* ever told me about his past; what's his deal? all he's told me is he's ex-military and his family is pushing up daisies in the rubble of tokyo."" ""he's ex sog, or special operations group: essentially japan's version of special forces. and he's a downright monster, too; you could give that man a butter knife and he could take out a whole swat team with it."" as if we were speaking of the devil, nobody entered from the back exit and stepped up next to us, his cold expression somewhat softened by the afternoon sun. i passed david another cigarillo, and he passed it to nobody, who quickly lit it and took a puff. r ""we were just talking about you, nobody; the kid had some questions about your old line of work."" nobody just shook his head, but he relented. ""i was a cqc specialist; i assisted in boarding ships."" ""oh, so like a navy seal?"" i asked. ""you could say that. i was part of an anti-piracy and counterterrorism unit though. the south china sea has the most piracy and human trafficking of any body of water in the world, so we were tasked with clearing out ships of scum and saving and extracting any hostages or vips."" ""that's pretty cool. i didn't know you were special forces."" nobody just shrugged and gestured to our bags. ""start prepping those guns; we're bound to receive the notification from charleston any minute now, and once he starts uploading the virus we'll need to be ready to face stiff resistance."" i nodded and opened up my bag, as did david. david pieces together a worn-looking mac-11 and i put together my tech nine. once we had put them together, we attached stocks and suppressors to our guns before loading them up with clips of nine-millimeter bullets. just as we finished, nobody's phone rang and he picked up. ""hello? yes, i see. we'll provide support soon. prep the timer."" he then put it away just as fast and turned to us, his expression as taciturn as ever. ""guard the door to the mainframe; clarkson, mjelno, and i will take care of security in the lobby and start gathering the hostages. our other friends from headquarters should be arriving any minute with some more firepower. we nodded. ""has charleston started working his techno-magic?"" ""yes. now look alive; once the local authorities find out what's going on they'll be sending out their xenos lap dog teams. shoot to kill, and show no mercy.""",NatureofPredators,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/16dwk1z/ficnapped_derailed_the_fifth_act_12/,0

16dudfj,worst experience ever,"let me preface with ive been to countless shows, multiple warped tours, few festivals. we arrived at orange lot at 1:55pm waited for two hours in the heat, no water was being supplied (thankfully we had 4 full water bottles for us two) we were about 20-30 people away from getting on the shuttle just to be told they were ‘evacuating’ due to possible inclement weather i have no service but i’d checked the weather, there was no rain in the forecast today. there was hardly a cloud in the sky. we waited for 2 more hours begging anyone around for some sort of update - again because there was no service we cannot check any internet updates and the staff was actually hiding from us, all we could do is listen to hearsay and the most baffling rumor we were hearing was that the festival music wasn’t delayed as well? it continued while we just sat waiting. multiple shuttles came but only dropped people off and went back. we decided to leave at 6:30 after hearing nothing from any staff after two hours. we drove about 20 minutes until we got service again, i told my girlfriend to check the instagram to see what they were saying and they said they got the ‘all clear to load buses again’ at 6:40pm we drove back, arrived back at 7:25pm because of the traffic, then it took us 20 mins to walk back from our car to the shuttle. we didn’t arrive at the festival until 8:35pm because the shuttles were stuck in traffic? (i thought that was the fking point of the shuttle) the only reason we were going today was for sleep token who performed at 7:30 and ended at 8:30pm… i got off the shuttle just to find out their set had ended and fucking turned around and boarded it again. livid doesn’t even begin to explain the feelings we’re experiencing. we sat in the heat for 6 hours and did not even see one band. where can i go for a refund?",Blueridgerockfest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blueridgerockfest/comments/16dudfj/worst_experience_ever/,0

chief hunter isif of the arxur dominion and now leader of the arxur rebellion. burner of worlds, savior of the cradle. two titles that have no reason to be held by the same individual. i shoved my emotions away as isif was the sole reason that my own people and so many other innocent peoples were not currently in the grasp of the oppressive paws of the federation. the ride had been painfully quiet as isif quickly tired of speaking. all i grasped was his own hatred for what he had been forced to be. yet there was a certain amount of gratefulness at no longer having to hide his defective nature and desire to openly speak let alone live in peace with the rest of the galaxy. the stoic kam sat to my left staring the large predator down begging him to try something. the nervous wreck to my left was the zurulian ambassador sofeh. and our pilot was former federation captain sovlin who was simply happy to be in the cockpit and not in the same room as the arxur leader. as isif simply sat there staring at a wall slowly breathing i cleared my throat desperate for something to distract me. “ahem. excuse me co-pilot? i apologize but i forgot your name?” i saw the timid head of my fellow venlil peek out from the cockpit “s-slanek mam.” slanek gave a quick glance towards isif before he returned to his console. if i didn’t know any better the look on his face would have… ah he’s scared of me. that’s… an odd feeling. not the first time a low ranking member of the military was intimidated by the leader of their home planet but the reality of being next to an arxur and i was the object to be feared really knocked me off balance. sovlin, thankfully. brought me back to reality. “alright we are coming out of ftl in the sol system in… 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” the view in front of the ship revealed we came out near the large gas giant named saturn. supposedly named after an ancient human god by the very extinct race that once called this system home. i couldn’t help but wonder what they would have named my home system. the nervous zurulian beside me shakily asked “a-are you s-sure the federation won’t realize our summit is being held here?” a scoff came from the cockpit. “the station itself is hidden in this gas giant’s rings. even then why would the federation bother to watch an extinct species?” we all calmed a bit knowing that we were safe for the moment. watching an arxur breathe a sigh of relief was something i never thought i’d love to see. wait… he’s asleep! with his eyes open! slanek addressed us with more confidence in his voice now. “we will be docking soon. looks like the paltan delegation is running a bit late but everyone else is here.” i hesitantly waved my paws in the air and while his eyes tracked the motion he made no acknowledgment. just a gentle quiet snore. i decided to press my luck and mock lunged at the predator and forced myself to not laugh as he jerked and took a defensive stance. the ragged beast huffed. “that was a very poor decision.” “it woke you up.” i couldn’t wipe the smirk off of my face. isif growled “the last time something lunged at me in my sleep i lost half my liver.” i ignored kam’s bulging eyes and sofeh’s surprised face in favor of watching sovlin and slanek dock with the ambassadorial station. it was a small military station, meaning it had little in the way of amenities that ambassadors and government officials were used to but it could house over a hundred fighter craft as well as comfortably house five thousand souls. if i asked kam to point out the station's most notable features, he’d point out the recently retrofitted plasma cannons and (one meter\] thick hull. though i believe the state of the art war room with a fissan quiet comm system is perhaps far more important. the ability to communicate without federation eavesdropping with every friendly species was key to organizing our resistance and hopefully push back. i still wonder how much the fissans are going to charge for this luxury. the fact it was developed outside of fed control meant we could trust the tech but if the fissans received a better deal from the federation we were all dead. as we entered the war room i instructed kam to sit to isif’s left while i sat to the right of him. he was going to unnerve people irregardless but i was confident that myself and kam could at least ease some concerns. i stood up to address the crowd. a number of power players and wild card species sat before me. the mazics, sulean and iftalie were perhaps the most important members to win over today. they have the most stable worlds at the moment and may actually be able to field armies and a respectable navy soon. the zurulians and yotul are also extremely important. the former for the mastery over medicine and the yotul, when viewed without federation racism, were exceptionally brilliant and eager to improve and industrialize and were in all likelihood going to prove themselves our equals at the very least. the fissans and nevoks were both our financial backers as well as key to developing new technologies to catch up to the kolshian shadow fleet. with any luck our new government wouldn’t be bankrupt after our deals with them. the thafki, talkan and currently absent paltans were not to be ignored either. the paltans will be able to provide extremely important bases to keep pressure on the federation if they are willing to let the frontline of the war be so close to their home system while the other two races will hopefully be able to help keep the war’s supply lines up and running. we also had a number of wild cards in attendance. the krakotl, harchen, tilfish and gojid union were all in a state of civil war. but the anti-federation forces were quick to ally together and seek help from the outside. their military forces will be essential for any real chance at victory. assuming we can end their wars in a timely manner. finally the arxur. despite their past we can not afford to lose their support. isif currently has about the same size military force as he had before only now more disorganized as dominion loyalists fled his ranks but arxur defects fled to his banner. a few of them have been working with us to train our forces into fighting shape and are just starting to see real progress. i cleared my throat and my mind. “i am sorry but the paltan delegation is running late. we will have to update them on our decisions when they arrive and take any information they might bring and possibly reconsider the decisions we make today.” breathing deeply i calmed myself and addressed the delegates with confidence. “we are here to build a better future. for not just ourselves but for our children, their children and every descendant that will be born into this galaxy. it is on us to set aside the past and look to the future. to this end i propose two things. if you look at the packets we distributed to you on your arrival is a set of terms for a new… federation to be formed by the members present. the name is open to be changed as are several of the terms but our running name is the ‘sapient coalition.’ my second order of business is to officially ask for the arxur rebels to be cleared of past crimes and recognized as the rightful rulers of wriss and be accepted into our coalition.” i sat down and to my surprise isif stood up. “to be clear. rejecting us will… not be considered a hostile act by myself or my rebels. we are under no delusions any longer. we are monsters and you are right to hate us. i apologize for everything we have done to you, but now is the time to fix the wrongs of the past. regardless of your decision today we offer our aid in defending your territory, attacking your enemies, and training your forces.” he briefly let his eyes fall on the thafki delegation but quickly looked to their feet before they could panic. “thafki, part of our war goals is the liberation of your homeworld and its return to your people. we would like to make a few naval bases there as a staging point to take wriss from the dominion. when that is achieved we will abandon the base and no arxur will step paw on your sovereign soil without your express permission. there is also the matter of your recently liberated peoples needing homes and care. if you would, i would speak with you after about how best to get them into your care.” he addressed the room now. “i will not ask you all for your forgiveness. i will ask you to work with us and make a future we’re none of us have to fear.” isif sat down and the virla the tilfish commander stood up. “you speak of peace but you still eat our flesh! you ask us to set aside our past when we know our loved ones will be eaten once they pass!” isif looked angry for a moment before he calmed himself and bowed his head. “we have no other choice. i would ask for animals from your homeworlds to serve as food but anything large enough to feed us was exterminated long ago. if you have another option, please, share it. the tilfish commander stood there for a moment before taking their seat again. the brief silence that followed was broken by sofeh of all people. “t-then why ask us for our dead and not for c-cloned organs?” isif had a blank look on his face for a moment. “that word did not translate correctly. you used one word but the translator spat out ‘tissue, organ or organism grown in a non-organic environment.’ what is this word?” another moment of stunned silence but this time the revelation that things were worse for the arxur than just no non-sapient food. they have no medical services. we assumed that the arxur were not as monstrous as we thought or at least at one point were like every other pre-uplift species but this… sofeh cleared her throat. “cloning is the process of taking stem cells from an organism and altering them to grow into an organ or muscle in an artificial environment also known as a plastic womb. these organs are usually transplanted into people with organ failure. but we make them in anticipation of need and not to order. they also have a definite shelf life. we have a lot of living but no longer viable organs that are simply incinerated. we could even increase production to feed you. that way no one has to live with their loved ones being used as food.” isif just stared in disbelief for a moment. “i- uh- yeah, yeah! that would be perfect! i have no objections to this! if you can get it shipped out quickly i can even have the bodies returned!” sofeh happily wagged her tail. “i’ll get right on that- oh! i also need to talk to you after. we need to get scans of your species biology and establish a baseline so we can treat them.” isif looked skeptical for a moment as the last time his people were ‘treated’ they faced a disease that starved them to death. sofeh seemed to notice this and clarified. “yes. with the war going on, arxur are going to be hurt and in need of surgery. we can’t provide medical practices without relevant information.” isif looked surprised that anyone would offer him aid without him asking. “you would tend to our sick and wounded?” the zurulian looked a little confused as she slowly realized her people's profession was not a universal constant. “we’ll supplement what your surgeons… already do… what happens to a wounded arxur?” the arxur rebel sighed in defeat. “if they survive and are no longer able to hunt, betterment would take them, label them as prey and process them into rations.” sofeh covered her mouth in shock. “and what do *you* do to your wounded?” isif looked like he would rather not speak about his decisions on this matter but answered either way. “what i can. we don’t have the privilege to care for those that get hurt. i have a small wounded colony set up and secluded away, we’re the injured are left to care for themselves. i would like to put them in your care if the offer still stands.” sofeh nodded her head with a look of determination that was not there before. “it does. we zurulians swore to care for all life like we used to before our uplift. we will care for them. we will be more than what the federation limited us to being. as to that… i was asked to seek assistance building up our military forces. we are lacking in military experience and our admirals and generals could use training to bring them up to galactic standards.” the rest of the meeting went by with few hitches. the revelation that the arxur needed our care as much as we needed their strength placed a newfound hope and camaraderie on our hearts. i couldn’t stop wagging my tail as i addressed the sapient coalition in its entirety. “that concludes this first summit! i believe things are going to turn out for the better of all!” we started to file out of the war room when isif asked one last question. “is there any reason that i can not have the location of this ambassadorial station? i’d like to be able to come and go without needing to head to skalga every time.” i rolled my eyes. “oh you were asleep when sovlin mentioned it. we are in the sol system.” isif almost choked in shock. “the sol system! i don’t have complete control of my sector! if a dominion spy noticed us then the federation or the dominion might be on their way! we need to evacuate immediately!” as if on cue the sirens went off alerting us to approaching unalied craft. i almost shouted at him. “what? were you planning on attacking skalga from this side!?!” isif through his paws into the air in disbelief. “no! we were observing humanity!” i watched isif follow kam out of the room and chased after them shouting, “humanity is extinct!” the predator shot me a glance backward, “they never went extinct! that was a cold war! only two nukes were used in an actual attack! all the others were tests to develop bigger and stronger bombs until the soviet union collapsed along with the dominions' hope humanity would turn out like them.” we arrived at the command deck. sovlin was sitting in his chair barking out orders. “are the delegates at their designated shelter areas?” a soldier stood to attention. “all but the venlil and arxur delegates sir! they… are actually here!” sovlin turned around to address us. “isif! did you call a ship here? they aren’t of federation make.” isif calmly replied. “no… but i think i know who they are.” i stepped forward. “sovlin please hail them.” he looked like he wanted to object but held his tongue. with a flick of an ear his right hand kolshian ordered them hailed. i approached the kolshian and asked. “if you don’t mind recel, i’ll handle this.” the screen lit up with the unmistakable visage of a human. his earthen skin and dark eyes fell upon me as he snarled. i decided to assert myself and not let his predatory fear tactics get the best of me. i could feel my translator push my words through my vocal cords in a cheap imitation of their guttural language. “i am governor tarva of the venlil republic of skalga. we will not be intimidated by your snarl! slow your craft and announce your reasons for approaching or you will be fired upon!” his snarl faded quickly as he gently covered his mouth. “i- i’m sorry. i was not snarling, merely smiling. i was happy to be making first contact with genuine aliens! my name is noah and we come in peace.” i skeptically tilted my head. “peace?” “yes. you know, without the intention of causing harm? the desire to cooperate and build a better future for both of our races?” kam stepped forward. “you said we? as in more than one person?” noah barked at kam. “oh right, where are my manners! this is sarah and our pilot marcel!” sarah stuck her head into frame! “hello nice to meet you!” she turned the camera towards marcel. “say hello!” the human pilot’s entire body was tense. his knuckles were white from how hard they were holding onto the controls. “i will once those weapons are no longer pointed at us. i’m ready to bail out of here the second they fire.” sovlin waved a paw and i heard the hum of the plasma cannons die down. their pilot let out a sigh of relief. “hello, sorry for being so terse. i’m marcel. pleasure to meet you.” *if the federation discovers humanity is alive… it’ll be skalga all over again.* “noah of earth?” noah straightened himself up. “yes mam?” *we have to save them.* “would you like to dock with this station? there is a lot we need to discuss. your species may be in grave danger, and it might be our fault for this being the case.” \_\_\_ i watched silently as secretary-general elias mier pinched the bridge of his nose. he sat amongst the members of the sapient coalition and took in the news about the galaxy at large. one moment ago his biggest problem was the member nations of his planet bickering amongst themselves and now the entire galaxy is at war on their very doorstep and they can’t pretend it won’t come to them. “ok this is a lot to take in. but i still think we might be able to end this peacefully through negotiations. we are a neutral party in all of this.” the collective sigh as the humans still refused to believe that negotiations were off the table was deafening. to think the war hungry and predatory people would stubbornly cling to the possibility of peace was aggravating. kam slammed his head on the table in exhaustion. he called the command deck and without lifting his head asked. “sovlin? how much longer before we can relocate?” \_\_\_ memory transcription subject: sovlin, sapient coalition admiral date \[standardized human time\] july 30h, 2115 all of the diplomats have been evacuated home with the sole exception of the new human ambassador noah, and governor tarva. i normally don’t care to listen to the debates of politicians but i made an exception for these two. the human with the dark complexion looked as upset as tarva is. “history has shown that time and time again that wars on a large scale only ever result in massive casualties with no actual change.” tarva was stress pulling at her ears. “noah. i love how much you want to stop this war before the death toll gets high. but there are already planets full of the dead. my people were genocided to extinction. then there deformed children were sent to re-establish a population of venlil on skalga.” she took a step forward and grabbed his paw in hers. “think about the mother’s who gave birth to children with no nostrils and legs so crippled we lost our ability to truly run. think about the fathers beaten, tortured and killed for trying to protect their families. think about the children who were taken from their home world and brainwashed into thinking it was a blessing.” noah opened his mouth to speak but no words came out. tarva pressed on. “that is just what happened to my species. the chance for peace ended the day the federation pacified the krakotl. it’s been over a thousand years of cultural genocide. and over four hundred years of war with the arxur. the time for peace was over before either of us were born.” tarva guided noah over to an empty chair but my attention was drawn away by recel at the sensor station. “sir! multiple contacts just came out of ftl!” “that should be isif’s reinforcements. double check to be safe. … recel? double check-“ “hostile contacts! federation cruiser and escorts! changing course and heading straight to us!” i slammed my paw down and shouted my orders through the station's speakers. “all hands battle stations! incoming federation cruiser! we have to hold them off until reinforcements arrive! scramble all fighter crafts!” i watched the federation cruiser approach through the view screen. those agonizing few moments before a battle starts, where all i can do is watch and wait, unable to issue any further orders slowly flowed by. i watched our fighters fly forward onto death to buy us all a few precious moments. their call signs went out as they assumed a basic formation designed to draw the enemies attention onto them and not the station. as i expected the cruiser unleashed her own fighters as well instead of facing the nimble fighters alone. “weapons station. focus fire on the cruiser. only fire on fighters if a guaranteed hit is available. we have to force them to flee.” in an instant both waves of fighters clashed. i watched ten of our craft disappear in the blink of an eye while they only lost two. despite outnumbering them by twenty we now only had a lead of 10… 7. 2. we have less craft than them now. “all fighters! fall back into the station's range! weapons! take out anyone pursuing our fighters! keep them alive! all hands! brace for impact and possible loss of life support or atmosphere!” the cruiser pressed her advantage using her own fighters as a shield. despite our own being in range for us to defend they still fell with alarming speed. only forty eight of our fighters still flew. i could hear the panic in their voices as one comm after another grew silent. “all fighters-“ what? recel almost screamed in excitement, “sir! it’s the humans! they sent reinforcements!” from earth came a thousand fighters. i couldn’t believe my eyes! in the short time since meir had left our station they had put together an actual space force! however recel’s face now screamed there was another problem. “sir… they don't have shields, or armor, or even decent inertial dampeners… sir all they seem to have are rail guns and missiles!” if they engaged the enemy here and now they’d be torn to shreds and their weapons would likely fail to do anything beyond adding a little stress to the enemy’s shield generators. “attention human forces! abandon your attack! you are out gunned and out armored! you’ll all be torn to shreds!” there was a brief moment of silence that hung in the air before a feminine human voice echoed through the command bridge. “admiral sovlin i presume? this is captain mcdermott of the un space force. we volunteered for this, sir.” i had no words. the familiar feeling of ordering my own ship to suicidally charge the arxur raced through my body. barely above a whisper i ordered “recel, patch them into our comms.” the attentive kolshian obeyed and i addressed our newest allies. “attention un forces! you are outclassed by the enemy. do not under any circumstances approach within (100 kilometers) of the enemy cruiser. those guns can track you faster than you can fly. the armor on their fighters is weakest at the lower back section and at the cockpit, however you won’t be able to break their shields so harass the enemy and pick off the ones who’s shields are broken.” a voice filled with confidence reported back. “roger that. alright boys! you heard the porcupine! fly lively and pick off the weakest ones first!” i turned my attention to the battle as a whole. i turned off sovlin the father who cared and turned on sovlin the suicidal captain. i watched my soldiers fly into battle. bullets and plasma flying across the cold unforgiving void of space. i listened to the last words of many people and gave orders to the survivors to step in their place. i watched dozens of human made crafts get taken down for each victory they earned. i watched helplessly as one of our own craft was disabled and abducted. i saluted the field of broken machines and floating graves as our rescue services started to pick them over for even the faintest hint of survivors. my voice was broken. “recel. status report.” “we lost seventy three craft of the one hundred we had. the humans lost eight hundred and forty one of the one thousand and twelve they fielded.” his breath caught in his throat as he realized just how many innocent people died at the hands of his old government. “the station itself has hull breaches in sectors two and four. sector two is also without power. plasma cannon 7 and 14 are destroyed beyond repair. one, four, eight, and ten are damaged and under repair. about twenty people have been reported to medical with severe injuries. eighteen confirmed dead.” \_\_\_ this is part 1 of 2 as it was a little too large for reddit! &#x200b; [part 2 here!]( LINK &#x200b; see [u/spacer\_neko4969](

16dstql,my experience with blueridge so far..,"blueridge experience: first day wendsday the 6th arrived in the camping check in line for cars at 8 pm, was then stuck in a line for 10 hours before reaching our campsite getting to the campsite the last stretch was grassland that was not prepped for camping or cars to drive through. multiple deep trenches that we were being ""directed"" over. the staff that was supposed to be guiding cars was standing in a group laughing at the cars ""about to lose their bumper"" on these trenches. the campsites had no indication for what the size of your campsite was, our section of the camping also had no trash cans within any sort of reasonable distance the closet one was the next camping sectioning from us we built our tent at 6am and finally slept what we could at 7am to about 9 before it was too hot to sleep day 2 thursday the 7th everything started fine and the shows where going, before going to see coheed and cambria, it started drizzling which was not forecast and quickly turned into a hail storm(dime size) the storm broke 2 of our tents which where fully staked and guy lined, leaving us with no option other then to leave and get a hotel. leaving there was no signage for exits, no staff helping. the shows were eventually canceled this night there where people stuck in the venue during the storm with no shelter, as most of these people where most likely not camping and had no car to even run too there was no evacuation plan. there was no emergency plan. the flood fences broke lighting struck the smartpunk records stage twice. day 3 friday the 8th arrived at the shuttles at around 1:30-2pm waited in line for 2 hours, after 2 hours there was lightning within 30 miles of the venue so the show was put on pause, and shuttles stopped moving. after the storm passed the shuttles where never restarted, we waited until 7pm they claimed the weather was the issue, however there was no rain by the shuttles and the storm had clearly passed the venue as they made a post saying the show was still on no staff had any clue what was actually happening or any type of plan. after leaving the parking lot, they made a post on instagram reinstated the shuttles to move. but what am i supposed to do, wait in a line for 2 hours, arrive at the venue ground wait in another line for 2 hours watch one band and the nights over? i also met multiple people who shuttling back took around 5 hours to get on a shuttle the night before things i overhead or saw: they would cut wristbands of anyone who tried walking instead of taking a shuttle to leave or enter the grounds i witnessed and heard about 10s of people running out of gas trying to get into the festival as some people where in the line for 13+ hours while waiting in the camping line, 2 men started arguing and this evemtually led to a fight, there was very clear escaltion of the situation. multiple people told a staff member who we could hear from our car calling to security and getting no answer. she was eventually told by some other department to not engage and let security deal with it who she couldnt reach. the argument escalated to one man throwing the other on the ground. im not sure how this ended but i do know security had no urgency to stop this and what i heard was the police eventually where called and arrived(idk how true that is). there was definitely no urgency from the security as it took over an 1.5 hours for anyone to show up and descalte the situation. the fight was stopped by people not security. staff was paid a day rate with no bonus or overtime pay. the guy i asked about this on wendsday night, had been there since 8am and was still there when we passed him at around 4am multiple bus drivers quit because of the horrible organazition of the event there was only 2 water stations i was ever able to find, which at one point ran out of water in 1. the ""search"" of the car was absolutely pathetic, it consisted of a staff member asking us if we had guns, drugs, or glass bottles in the car, shined a flashlight through the windows and said okay and moved on he clearly didnt believe us when we said we didnt have drugs, but litterally just said okay with a long face and moved on i saw one police dog walking around",Blueridgerockfest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blueridgerockfest/comments/16dstql/my_experience_with_blueridge_so_far/,0

governor tarva of the venlil republic** *date \[standardized human time\]: april 10, 2143* there was a quiet tap at the door to my office. “come in,” i called out, knowing who it would be. as expected, kam poked his head in with a datapad clutched in his paws. “tarva, the latest report just came in,” he said, walking over and placing the pad on the desk. sliding it over to me i quickly skimmed the report. in the last three paws, two more settlements had fallen, their populations having been slaughtered to a fraction of their previous size. the trains were also due to come in today after unexpected delays, bringing much-needed supplies to bolster the capital’s defenses. and the search teams sent into dawn creek and the other initial cities had returned with their first batches of survivors. my tail twisted in discomfort at that last point. while i understood the logic using teams of predator desiease patients for suicide missions like this rubbed me the wrong way. not that we had any better options in a situation like this. letting out a tired sigh i placed the pad down and leaned back in my chair. in summary, the situation remained exactly as it did before, unless there was a miracle we were simply buying time until the inevitable end. “thank you kam, you’re dismissed now,” i said, eyeing the bottle hiding in my drawer. i always needed a pick-me-up after being reminded of the hopelessness of our situation. he stood in front of my desk, eyeing me somberly. “you’re gonna pull out that bottle again aren’t you,” he said, more of a statement than a question. i jerked in surprise, my paw moving instinctively to the drawer. “w-what, you mean?” i replied, a little defensively. letting out a sigh of his own he pulled up a chair to stand across from me. “i’ve known you long enough to tell when you’re drinking,” he explained simply. he seemed to consider for a moment, then asked, “what concentration is it?” “currently working my way through a bottle of shade berry whiskey, 95% concentration,” i replied, i didn’t have the energy to deny it. “it was supposed to be for a celebration,” i said more quietly. “not much celebration to enjoy these days,” he said heavily. “that being said, impairing your judgment during a time like this is not wise,” he added. i considered him for a long moment, “kam if you think me being sober is going to change things then i can’t decide whether to be grateful for your faith in me or question if we’re reading the same reports.” i replied eventually. “tarva, even if your mental faculties have no effect on our overall war effort, i still don’t want to watch you drink yourself to a grave,” he said sadly. “happens to the best of us, unfortunately.” before i even managed to open the bottle, kam snatched it out of my paws. “general kam, what do you think you’re doing?” i asked, irritated by him taking my drink. “i’m sorry, tarva, but i can’t watch you do this to yourself!” kam exclaimed as he held the bottle in his hands, “i understand your want to give up, but we have to hang on until the gojids get here.” “the gojids likely didn’t get the signal, kam. now, let me drink in peace,” i said as i walked out from behind the desk and attempted to take it back only for kam to move it further out of my reach. “tarva, i wholeheartedly can’t watch you drink yourself into a mess-” kam was quickly cut off “then leave! if you don’t want to watch then leave!” i exclaimed before taking a shaking breath, “i just want to live my last moments unfeeling.” “but tarva-” “that’s an order, general!” kam was taken aback for a moment. he wanted to refuse, but that would be considered insubordination, so he handed back the bottle with apparent apprehension. right when it was within reach, i snatched it out of his paws and took a few gulps before slumping back in my chair. kam’s tail slumped before leaving my office with a saddened expression. seeing his demeanor, it was clear it wasn’t sadness he felt, it was shame. as time dragged on, i woke up laying atop my desk with an empty glass bottle on the floor. i don’t remember what happened, but i was definitely drunk out of my mind. i sat up and hopped off my desk only to be smacked in the face with a serious hangover. i gripped my pounding head as i stumbled out of my office and towards the kitchen to get some water. i passed a few staffers who all shot me concerned looks as i stumbled and tripped down the hallway. eventually, i found the right door and pushed it open and nearly fell over in the process. i took a second to regain my footing before making my way to the water cooler. i took a disposable cup and filled it to the top before drinking it all in one gulp. after a few cups, i started to feel better and think clearly again. when i took a seat by one of the tables in the kitchen, kam walked in with a datapad in his hands and noticed i was already there. we made eye contact and stared at each other for a few seconds before moving on and getting what he came here for. i stood silent as kam continued with his day like nothing happened as my mind began screaming at me to say something. once kam was at the door, i blurted out. “kam, wait!” i exclaimed. “i want to apologize for earlier.” kam stopped at the door and turned around with a curious expression on his tail and face. “i shouldn’t have yelled at you the way i did and having you witness me in such a state was undeserved,” i stated apologetically. “i hope this doesn’t change anything between us.” kam turned around and looked at me with a somewhat smug expression. “tarva, you know this isn’t the first time i have seen you at your lowest,” he said casually. “if this was enough to make me leave then i wouldn’t have been by your side for as long as i have. just make sure you take better care of yourself, okay?” “i will.” right when kam was about to leave, the bunker suddenly shook with a loud bang coming in from above. alarms began going off all over the facility as workers and soldiers ran throughout the facility. the loud sirens startled me as kam retreated back into the kitchen to stay out of the way. he began scrolling through his datapad and selecting different files until he found live footage from the outside camera showing a horde of mutants surrounding the facility. they all stood to the side as a super mutant rammed into the bunker's front entrance. although the bunker was engineered and constructed to withstand an antimatter missile, the mutants will eventually break through anyway given enough time. seeing so many of these things at once was overwhelming considering what they could do upon first arriving. just the thought of what they’ll do once they manage to break in was enough to make me sick to my stomach and bring me to the verge of vomiting. kam dropped the pad onto the table and brought me back to reality before i could expel the inner contents of my stomach. i looked into his eyes to find the same calm and reassuring expression he always had in times of crisis, but this time there was only fear. seeing him like this felt out of place as he never expressed or even succumbed to his emotions to this degree. from this alone, i realized just how much this was taking its toll on kam and possibly everyone else. the stoic and unwavering demeanor he had for so long was crumbling before my very eyes. a soldier eventually burst into the kitchen with a gun in his paws before calling out to his men down the hallway. “what’s going on!?” i asked, alarmed as several heavily armed venlil poured into the room. “the bunker has been compromised, all important personnel are being evacuated,” the squad leader answered. following the squad, we ran through the hallways as alarms continued to blare. more high-ranking officials joined us as distant screams echoed throughout the concrete hallways. after a few minutes, we emerged into a hidden garage with several all-terrain, tactical vehicles waiting. placing a paw on the wall, i stopped to catch my breath. my legs were burning and i could feel my heart beating out of my chest from over-exertion. the rest of our impromptu herd wasn’t in much better shape, and the screams were getting closer. mustering my remaining stamina, i made my way towards one of the heavily armed vehicles nearby as a handful of other government officials followed close behind. i looked back for a second to see if kam was amongst the group, but quickly noticed he wasn’t on board. by the time i even noticed, the soldiers had already secured the vehicle i was in and forced me back into my seat. it wasn’t long until the vehicle started and drove out of the garage with the others not too far behind. i watched through the windows as we began moving through the ruined city. a city that thousands, if not millions, have called home was now in shambles. buildings that once pierced the sky and stood as high as the clouds were now reduced to rubble; homes that were once filled with people of all different kinds were now barren of all life. i never thought i would ever live to see a sight like this. quickly driving through the rubble, we left the city and entered the woods. once or twice, i spotted mutants prowling through the trees, but they never got close enough to threaten us. after a couple of minutes, i tapped the driver on the shoulder, “where’re we heading?” i asked quietly. “there’s another bunker deep in the wilderness. it’s been abandoned for 20 years, but it should suffice, we should reach it in about a claw,” she responded. slumping back into my seat i rested my face against the window as the trees passed by. after some time, the lingering stress and boredom got to me, and i fell asleep. **\[warning: subject unconscious\]** **\[skipping to next available memory\]** i was jostled awake as the convoy slowed to a stop. peeking out the windows i could see we were outside another vehicle garage, this one showing the signs of being long abandoned. after some tinkering with the mechanism the door slid open and we rolled inside. the lights overhead flickered faintly as the backup generators were roused online. the air was choked with dust, rust-covered much of the exposed machinery, and discarded equipment and general detritus littered the floor. “it’s not pretty, but it’s better than being dead.” one of the other officials said dryly as we climbed out of the vehicles. “we’ll head out and secure the bunker, make sure the structure is still sound.” the guard commander declared as he gestured for the troops to move out. they all hurried down the hallway, leaving me and the other high-ranking leaders to wait in the vehicle bay. “well, what do we think of our new home?” someone said, breaking the silence. “it’s a bit of a fixer-upper,” i responded, leaning against a large all-terrain tire. “true enough,” someone else said, picking at the rust on an exposed pipe. “but with the emp that thing is throwing off shutting down air transport, this was the only place we could get to in a reasonable time frame. might as well make the most of it,” he continued, moving to inspect some wiring. “might as well try and make it livable then,” i said, walking to the wall and picking up a broom leaning against it. taking my cue, the others started to tidy up the place. none of the trash or dust could be disposed of yet, so it was all piled off in a corner. spare supplies were put away on the shelves, some of which needed to be reattached to the walls. some of the wiring was exposed and pipes cracked but some tape took care of that handily. after just a few minutes, the vehicle bay was in much better shape than when we had found it. which once again left us all standing around awkwardly again. after a few minutes of idle chatter, i looked around and asked, “you think they’ve finished securing this place by now?” “the bunker disrupts internal communications but i can try asking,” one of the generals replied. pulling out a radio, he thumbed it on and asked for a status report. there was no reply. he tried asking again and once again received no reply. “as i said, the bunker’s just disrupting the signal,” he said, though he didn’t sound confident. we continued to wait in silence, though a new air of tension had fallen upon us. eventually, one of the high-ranking officials spoke up. “look, if the bunker is the reason behind the interference, then maybe we should go see for ourselves,” he suggested while seemingly second-guessing the idea at the same time. “are we sure that they’re not just taking their time?” someone else suggested. “sweeping the facility can’t take *that* long, can it?” i countered. “this is a relatively small facility meant to house only essential government personnel,” the general from earlier added. “can you go take a look to make sure they’re alright, general?” i asked. he hesitated for a moment, then wagged his tail in acknowledgment and walked out of the garage, snagging two aides to come with him. they both were given handguns in case something were to go wrong, but didn’t fully know how to use them seeing how they were handled. i watched as the three left the garage and into the hallway leading further into the bunker. after a few minutes, the general returned alone with his gun still in his paws. “where are the others?” i asked curiously. “we found a backup generator in one of the rooms further down, so they decided to stay behind and fix it while i came back to fetch you,” the general answered with a strangely calm tone in his voice. “alright, lead the way, general.” he signaled the other officials to follow him with a sway of his tail. he led us out of the garage and into the hallways deep within the bunker. we huddled together out of instinct since it felt like we were being watched despite its emptiness. as we walked down the corridor, i began to notice just how worn out the facility really was. corroded metal lined the walls with the ceiling filled with cracks and missing pieces; cobwebs covered almost everything the eye could see with chunks of concrete laying across the floor. the soldier from before stated this place was abandoned over 20 years ago, but going off of what i was seeing, i could be convinced it was longer. the general stopped ahead before looking around the corner to make sure the coast was clear. for a moment, i thought it was unnecessary since he was able to come back in one piece, but one could never be too careful under these circumstances. after confirming everything was clear, he signaled us to move ahead as he looked out behind us. upon turning the corner, i saw a sight i hoped i’d never see: the soldiers sent to search the bunker for any mutants were brutally mutilated. not only that, but this encounter was different from the last one. rather than their remains just being sprawled across the floor, their torsos were cut in half and they hung along the walls by large pieces of metal hammered into their forearms; their ribs were seemingly broken open and revealed their inner chest cavity; i watched as their lungs inflate and their hearts still continue to beat despite already losing so much blood. i couldn’t imagine the amount of pain they must have been in before losing consciousness. i remembered all the things we’ve said about the arxur and how they were vicious, animal-like monsters, but now i began to think differently. if the arxurs were the embodiment of everything the federation stood against, then what was this thing we found? i looked down at the bloody mess before me and saw the torn-out eyes of the soldiers laying on the floor. upon first glance, i thought they were positioned to face the group of officials, but looking closely i noticed they were all facing… me… i was about to ask the general what the meaning of thi- **\[warning: memory transcription interrupted. cerebral trauma detected\]** **\[recalibrating…\]** **\[error: anomalous brain activity detected | transcription integrity uncertain\]** **\[continue? y/n\]** **> y** **\[continuing transcription\]** opening my eyes, i quickly glanced around and found myself in the confines of my office. the clock on the wall marked it as the middle of the third claw; it all looked as if everything was normal. levering myself out of my chair, i walked to the door and peered out into the hallway. it was empty and absent of any venlil. i looked out the window and peered into the city outside only to see it completely intact. i took a closer look and noticed that the streets were strangely empty: the bustling herds of venlil, and the bustling sounds of vehicles cruising down the streets were gone. there was no trace of anyone ever being here, it’s as if this place was abandoned. slowly, i walked out into the hallway, noting the lack of officials and aides that would be expected in the heart of the republic's government. i wandered around the establishment before leaving the palace to the outside world. i wasn’t able to find anyone until i found myself striding out of the front door. i went to the courtyard and the only sound that i could hear was the soft rustling of leaves as the wind blew by. none of this was right, this couldn’t be real, but it all seemed real. i brushed my paw against one of the trees to reassure myself. the texture of the bark wasn’t any different from regular wood as far as i could tell. what the speh was going on here? “you seem lost,” a feminine voice called from behind me. whipping around, i could see a small cream-colored venlil sitting on a low wall. her eyes were fixed on me, and her tail was waiving contently in the air. “that’s one way to put it,” i admitted. she didn’t respond, simply sat there and watched. where the brahk did she come from? after a couple of awkward seconds, i broke the silence, “can you tell me what’s going on?” i asked. “i woke up from my office only to find this place completely deserted.” “they’re gone,” she said simply. “gone? what do you mean gone?” i continued. she flicked her ears in apology, “sorry, i just know that they’re gone,” “that’s helpful,” i muttered sarcastically as i walked away. i turned around and walked away from the strange venlil before hearing soft pattering on the marble floor behind me. glancing behind me, i could see that the small venlil was following me. “something i can help you with?” i asked. “not really, but i could use some company after being alone for so long,” she said merrily. i sighed in annoyance as i walked down the empty street, ignoring the cream ball of floof at my side. as we strolled out of the courtyard and into the city just outside, i tried to recall the last thing i can remember. there wasn’t much to go off of, unfortunately, only blurs and murmurs of people i think i knew. i attempted to remember what brought me here in the first place, but nothing came to mind. eventually, i pushed those thoughts aside so i could focus on what was in front of me. i looked around the building towering over me and the cars parked on the side of the road. everything i saw was almost exactly as how i’d picture the city if no one was here. shops and small businesses were closed, street lights glow dimly from above, and the only thing that will never remain undisturbed are dirt particles that float in the wind. there was nothing to really see or watch happen since there was no one nearby. the empty environment brought a sense of peace and tranquility i never felt before. the people that once filled the streets, and the weight that came with being governor, were gone. it wasn’t long after this sense of peace washed over me that something was off. it felt like something else was here, and whatever was bringing this feeling was watching from the dark. that feeling soon dissipated when the venlil next to me spoke up. “you look tense,” she observed. “something is off, the entire city couldn’t have just up and left,” i muttered. “maybe they’re sleeping?” she suggested. “you’d expect people to be up and about at all times, we don’t have a day and night cycle after all,” i countered. “well if you want to meet new people just head in there,” she offered, pointing. following her finger, my gaze rested on a squat, plain-looking building next to us. “what’s in there?” i asked. “old man stellen,” she replied, prancing up to the door and pushing it in. following her we stepped into a rustic room, with several tables and a bar along one wall. wiping down a glass with a rag an old venlil stood behind the bar. his gray fur was patchy with age, the exposed skin marred with the signs of time. glancing up at the door opening, he waved his tail in greeting. “good claw, stellen,” “governor, anything i can get ya?” he greeted, giving a respectful ear wave to the both of us. “my usual,” the creamy white venlil replied as she wandered off to study some knick-knacks sitting on worn shelves. i hmm’d to myself as i studied the rows of bottles. “something light,” i decided after a moment of pondering. “i got some 35% beer,” stellen offered. “that’ll do,” i said, walking up to the bar and sitting down. i didn’t feel like drinking right now but maybe i could pump him for information. “streets have been empty lately,” i said casually as i took a small sip. “aye, they have been,” he agreed. “any idea what’s up with that? i tried asking selvin but her answers haven’t been helpful,” i continued. “heh, i’d imagine, that girl always got her head stuck in the clouds,” he replied, gesturing to the venlil in question. “from what i’ve heard, they’re afraid of a large beast that’s been said to prowl the streets lately. most of the residents are hiding away in their homes,” he continued. “wouldn’t the exterminators deal with it?” i asked, confused. “rather hard to deal with something when you’re dead and your pieces are scattered across the street,” he replied casually. “oh,” was all i could think to say. “yeah, everyone is too afraid to be out and about when they could run into it. you can never know if that shadow in the alleyway is just a shadow or an omen of death,” he finished. i silently pondered that as i finished off my drink. why does that sound so vaguely familiar? a monster that has been wandering the streets and is known for tearing apart its victims and scattering their remains everywhere, an omen of death that can be confused for a shadow? at first, i would have assumed it was some kind of rogue arxur, but they aren’t known for waiting for prey to reveal themselves. not to mention, none of the exterminators were able to handle this thing at all. i began thinking about the situation and how it could be handled, but my thoughts began drifting towards what this thing sounded like. eventually, a blurry image came to mind. i can’t fully picture it, but it must’ve been what i saw before falling asleep. “sounds familiar oddly for some reason.” “hmm? how so?” “i think it might have been a dream i had before waking up,” i answered before continuing on. “i’m not entirely sure what i saw, but i think i remember witnessing a towering figure bigger than any creature i have ever seen ram themselves into a bunker door. despite the strength of the reinforced walls, it was able to break through after some time. it was strong, probably stronger than any arxur i have ever seen. stellen’s tail twitched slightly after describing what i witnessed, “my, that sounds more like a nightmare than a dream if you ask me. if i saw something like that i would’ve passed out at the sight of it,” he stated before refilling my glass. “yeah, you’re probably right.” i answered stellen before downing my next drink. **\[warning: memory transcription integrity failing. transcription accuracy 96%\]** “do you happen to know what this beast looks like?” i asked out of curiosity. “not really, it’s said its appearance is “subjective” in some way.” i gave him a confused look before responding, “what do you mean subjective?” stellen sighed before answering, “it’s hard to put into words. rather than having a look anyone can recognize, its appearance is determined by whoever is looking at it.” “...what?” i replied as i tried to wrap my head around what he just said. how can something, let alone a living creature, be capable of something like that? “that’s one of the other reasons why it’s been so hard to deal with. not only is it strong enough to tear through an entire station’s worth of exterminators, but it can hide in plain sight,” stellen continued. “not only that, but it can solidify whatever appearance it wants, making it even harder to catch.” i tried to visualize what this thing could look like, but i don’t think it’d be possible if i were able to. a creature capable of taking any appearance presented to it through the mind of the observer is absolutely insane. something like this is more dangerous than anything we have ever faced. a being capable of taking any appearance presented and sticking with it to blend into crowds, a being strong enough to single handedly overpower even the strongest and most prepared of exterminators. despite the outlandishness of what stellen told me, it all somehow sounded familiar. it felt like i came across something like this before, but what could it be!?. i thought relentlessly on this familiar feeling until my train of thought was interrupted by stellen. “it’s closing time, governor,” stellen stated as he stashed away the bottle and began tidying up. “i’d like to chat a little longer, but i’m afraid i’ll have to get going now if i don’t wanna get caught.” “i understand, i’ll see you next time, stellen,” i said to stellen before parting from his establishment. making my way quietly down the street, i kept my senses peeled for anything unusual apart from my own worried heartbeat. the area was dead silent. i looked around the block and felt like something was out of place. the buildings, light poles, and the sky somehow felt different despite there being no changes. for some reason, everytime i looked at the sky it seemed more broad in terms of color and the street lights glowed brighter than usual. i couldn’t understand why i felt this way, so i shrugged it off as a side effect of my paranoia and moved on. after a while, the footsteps of the child following behind me started to sound heavier. i looked behind me to see if she was okay, but i noticed something off upon seeing her: her fur was a little more roughed up from when i first met her, and the slight orange tint she had to her pale skin somehow disappeared; the look in her eyes changed from being curious and innocent to being more convoluted. i couldn’t fully describe the look she gave me, but i know for sure something changed. “is everything alright governor?” she asked in the same soft voice as before. i rubbed my eyes a bit before answering, “i-i’m fine. i’m just worried about the monster wandering around.” “are you sure? your paws are shaking.” she pointed out i looked down at my paws and noticed the tremors she mentioned. they shook relentlessly in response to the fear i was feeling. i never fully realized just how afraid i was of something i’ve never seen before. i needed to get my mind off of that thing. “it’s nothing. by the way, i never asked you what your name was.” “oh you’re right! my name is \[error\]” **\[warning: memory transcription integrity failing. transcription accuracy 78%\]** my vision blurred for a moment. when it cleared up, i looked up at the sky and it somehow changed. rather than just the single red dwarf that we have always known, there were hundreds of other stars in the sky. from what i could tell, these things were gargantuan in size and made the vast distances between them seem small by comparison. the variation of colors between each celestial body was far greater than what is known today; some of which made me wonder just what they were made of. i looked back at the horizon and saw the once dim dwarf with a size so great that its horizon was completely flat. it occupied nearly half the sky with its unreasonable size and luminosity while somehow not vaporizing the planet. i looked back down at the little venlil before and was happy to see that nothing about her changed despite her roughed up appearance. she had a concerned look on her face when she noticed my expression. she placed her paw on my arm and attempted to comfort me in hopes of calming me down. “i don’t think you’re okay, governor,” she said with a concerned expression. “i think you need to get home and rest.” i let out a slight sigh before responding, “you’re probably right. the drinks didn’t really do much to calm my nerves or get my mind off of that… thing.” i continued walking towards the mansion with \[error\] by my side in silence. during said walk, i gazed endlessly at the sky, wondering where i was. within this madness of blindingly bright stars and unknown a sky i barely recognize, i somehow felt home. i know for certain i never saw any of this before, but it was all starting to feel familiar. what i witnessed and the sights that i beheld is something i could never forget or overlook. this place is \[error\] **\[warning: memory transcription integrity failing. transcription accuracy 42%\]** i looked upon the landscape afar and witnessed as the buildings of the surrounding city began taking shapes that were nigh impossible. the hills that covered the horizon began to shift and pulsate like the surface of a beating heart while the buildings and skyscrapers within the capital twisted and churned in ways that i never thought possible. this sight bestowed upon me these mutating grounds and shifting structures felt like a hallucination, a dream, a nightmare. the movements and shapes of these things somehow possessed an indescribable form of harmony despite its motion and flexibility contradicting its own physical dimensions. it was like peering into the mind of a god and trying to process the madness held within: no matter how hard i tried to fully grasp what i was seeing, i couldn’t. no form of words or reasoning of any kind could ever fully explain what i was seeing. this world i find myself in was unlike anything i could ever imagine or even dream of seeing. this union of separation, this collection of sundering logic, this self-contradicting reality of harmonious chaos had unveiled itself before me. within all this mess of madness and insanity, there was, in some way, a sense of order and serenity. this sensation i have experienced wasn’t like any other; to describe it through conventional language, through the words we have known since the dawn of our species, would be like trying to make an insect comprehend the true size of the world it lives in. it just isn’t possible. i felt the little girl next to me grab my paw as i looked down at her. she was different now with her once white, fluffy wool and pale skin turned gray, almost as gray as me. the look on her face brought a sense of familiarity, one in contrast to my thoughts before. it felt like i’ve known her for my entire life, and yet i don’t know a single thing about her. amidst this feeling, there was a subtle sensation of grief, one that only comes from loss. i tried to break it down, take apart what i felt to figure out what this was, but it wasn’t long before that solemn thought subsided. without saying a word, she guided me to my mansion. upon entering it, i was met with the air’s warm and humid embrace. i could hear the squish of every step i took against the fleshy floor below me, and the bellows of the great halls held within. i knew this place, i was home. **\[warning: memory transcription integrity failing. transcription accuracy 21%\]** i soon reached the confines of my bedroom. the smell was rich in iron as the walls and ceiling were covered in the crimson veins i knew all too well. i sat on the edge of my bed as tiredness and exhaustion filled my body. i layed down on the soft, moist contents of my bed as the little girl from before laid beside me. **\[warning: memory transcription integrity failing. transcription accuracy 5%\]** before drifting off to sleep, she asked me one simple question with a unique accent. “do you still remember me, old friend?” i thought for a moment before answering instinctively, “i’m sorry, but i don’t know you.” **\[warning: memory transcription integrity failing. transcription

16drvua,i’ve never experienced such incompetence in my life…,"today we waited for six hours… to get on a bus and guess what, we never did! we were the next people to get on a shuttle until security started saying they’re closing the festival for the rest of the day… from 1:30pm until 7:30pm we waited in line, no food, no water, and 2 porta potties for hundreds of people waiting in line. during this entire time the festival still went on even though buses stopped because of “inclement weather”. we then heard security talking about capacity issues since the lot we were in was completely full and people were parking on the sides of the road. (we then found out that it was a capacity issue because the state police had to get involved since they over sold on tickets…) at 7:30pm we were leaving the lot and then was told that the buses were starting again… reparked, got back on line (not at the front since we left), to then get delayed more again because people that parked on the side of the road were blocking the buses… by the time we would have gotten on the buses we would only be in the festival about 2.5 hours, to then get home super late and wake up crazy early to do it all over again. i genuinely thought yesterday was bad but holy shit… yesterday we tried to wait out the storm since they kept saying “the show will continue don’t worry” but that turned into every body leave. which was 3-4 hours standing out in the cold with no food and water or bathrooms to get onto a shuttle. hell there was a women that went into labor and i hope she’s okay. atleast we were able to even get in yesterday. the entire “emergency evacuation” system they had was probably thought up of on the fly… how do you hose a festival / event this big without a solid emergency plan? one water station is actually mind boggling. you want to sell 50,000 tickets and have one place for everyone to get water? and block off the other one behind an even more expensive paywall? its 95+° outside! from a public health perspective that’s just not okay at all. i’m so over it… they’re definitely not giving out refunds for this, start collecting phone numbers with people that have phots and videos of everything and start a class action lawsuit. this would have been my first rock festival and the friends i were also with so badly wanted to see their favorite artists today. i’d love to feel some sort of positivity but that’s just not happening right now. definitely not coming back any year after this. hopefully the next two days go differently. shit happens but this?… this is unacceptable.",Blueridgerockfest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blueridgerockfest/comments/16drvua/ive_never_experienced_such_incompetence_in_my_life/,0
16dr3lv,aita for making an issue from my house guest not introducing himself?," after my very bad breakup with my ex from another nationality, he brought his younger brother (around 24-25 years old) to live with my homecountry. despite the sour history, i agreed to let his brother who i never ever met in person stay in my flat for a short while as my ex could not get a place for his arrival and both of them were just couchsurfing wherever they can. i arrived home quite late on the day the brother was moving in. the guy was sitting in my living room with his laptop. he just shouted out from the room saying thank you for letting him stay. as we never met before i thought a proper introduction of himself would be the minimum but the brother had no intention to do so; therefore i walked up to him, asked if i am disturbing and may i introduce myself. then i was informed that he is working but i can go ahead. this struck me as impolite and disrespectful and lack of manners considering my upbringing and cultural norms. i felt like i had to pressure an introduction out from him. despite this initial negative impression, i tried to be friendly the next morning when we had a brief chat. i had every intention of being hospitable throughout his stay, even though i knew deep down i wouldn't like this guy. later, after my ex asked about our first meeting with his bro, i explained the situation and my takeaway from it and added a sarcastic remark at the end referring to the fact that his brother is not a better person than him. when i returned home from work, i found the brother leaving with two large bags, saying that he is going for a walk in the city. it turned out that he is in fact evacuating because my ex had shared my entire message that i sent to him with his brother including my sarcastic comment. the situation escalated to such level that i was being called a two faced liar (and many more things) and accused with destroying his brothers impression of the country and his first days via text. and saying i was rude expressing my opinion without considering that the brother was working when i arrived home. and the fact that he worked that time should just eliminate my issue. i think first impression is important and i am right to think in such situation that not introducing yourself is disrespectful and rude especially when you are an unkown guest in someone's property. i am quite flexible person so if he would just say that he is so busy with work at that moment and at least would show a motive that he will might initiate an introduction when he finished i would be also fine. thinking about it i started to feel bad because i genuinely like to help people, especially the foreigners around me and i feel awful destroying the brothers first days. do you think i am overreacting the issue and i should beg for forgiveness from the brother? or my ex wanted to make me seem like the bad guy here? or simply it is on the brother for being so impolite? please help me decide who is the asshole here!!!",AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dr3lv/aita_for_making_an_issue_from_my_house_guest_not/,0

16dpwop,rectocele repair surgery scheduled - what to expect,"if you've had rectocele repair surgery: 1. what was it like? 2. what was recovery like? 3. what restrictions did you have? 4. if you've had a hysterectomy, were there any similarities to recovery or restrictions? (i have already had a hysterectomy.) 5. anything else you think i should know? the rectocele is 3.9 cm. as mentioned above, i have already had a hysterectomy. i was told the recovery isn't as long as the hysterectomy and that i won't have as many restrictions - not sure i believe it. no, i have never been pregnant, and never given birth. as part of the recovery, i know i can't lift anything more than 5 pounds or push or pull anything. i know i have to eat a lot of fiber, and that i'm expected to walk occasionally. i've been to a gastroenterologist, a gi specialist, a urogynecologist, and talked to my primary care physician and gynecologist (who did my hysterectomy). the gastroenterologist did a colonoscopy, didn't find any issues, and said i'm pooping multiple times a day and feeling like i never fully evacuate because my intestines are too convoluted, and nothing can be done about that. sent to pelvic floor pt. went to many sessions and was told i was doing well. it helped, but didn't solve the problem. went back to gastroenterologist. he said he didn't know the source of the constipation. he didn't recommend rectocele surgery because it's not 100% effective. i asked for the anorectal manometry test (couldn't expel the balloon) and defecography test. defecography showed the rectocele. went to initial consultation with urogyn. was told that because i didn't know the source of the constipation, that rectocele surgery would only be 50% effective. sent back to pelvic floor pt. i've been to more sessions of pelvic floor physical therapy than i can remember. it has definitely helped me to not strain. but it didn't solve the rectocele. my physical therapist has told me i've learned everything i'm going to learn from therapy. i'm still doing the daily exercises. saw my pcp. she recommended the rectocele surgery and gave me a script to see a gi specialist. gynecologist also recommended the surgery. gi/motility specialist said that while they didn't definitively solve the source of constipation, that the only other test i can get would be the sits marker test, but that would be pointless because i don't have a slow transit issue - if i did, medications i'm taking wouldn't work as they do, and i wouldn't be having as many bowel movements a day as i am. went back to the urogyn. told her everything i know. was told i have more like a 70% effective rate for the surgery. not sure if she was just telling me what i wanted to hear. however, at this point, i want to know i did everything i can to resolve this. medications: right now i'm taking linzess every other day and 15 ml milk of magnesia every day. after the surgery, i'm really hoping i can get to a point where i'm taking just the milk of magnesia. linzess works wonderfully, but my insurance wants to change $455 until i've hit my deductible. i tried switching to amitesa, which really didn't do much of anything, and i could feel poop moving into the rectocele - drove me nuts. diet: i'm a vegetarian (no meat or fish) and eat lots of vegetables, a good amount of fruit, sunflower seeds, chia and flax seeds. i drink a lot of water. occasional whole grains (whole wheat, brown rice, quinoa are great), occasional eggs, occasional dairy. i try to avoid white bread, white pasta, white rice. gi specialist recommended kiwi fruit. i like them, but it didn't do much for me. dragon fruit, on the other hand, is wonderful. i try to walk for 30-60 minutes every day.

16dl5iu,[fl] my manager targets me and lies to our higher ups about me.,"hi! i am posting in here because i am at my wits end. i don’t know what to do or even if i can do anything. i don’t have much experience in an office setting. i am a person who works at an online call center job. i have a manager who is the manager of just my department. there’s three levels of people above her. she asked me to come to this job with the promise of 5 days a week. she normally likes people to work 6; but i have worked before with her at another job and she called and asked me to join her. i think these events that follow are because she wants me to work more. she’s now not the same boss i knew. she’s non helpful with tasks. she targets me in a group setting. she said i changed something on our google excel sheet… but it was her and i have proof in the edit history… she asked me to do a task and made it seem unimportant and something i could do in my free time, assigned me other tasks on top of that as well. it turns out there was a contest and a deadline for that first task that i didn’t even know about which was one of my days off. the biggest thing i would say that she’s done was we just had that hurricane here and i lived in a mandatory evacuation zone, as did the rest of our department. we were affected for two day. tuesday the manager expected the other girl and i in the department to drive to work in the pouring rain while the manager stayed home and “rearranged furniture”. the other girl was moving and complained and the manager said not to come in then the manager told me i could work from home. so i turned back and went home (1 hour drive) to go home and work instead. i was the only one who worked that day. i stopped at 1pm to evacuate my house and went inland. which is great because my area had severe flooding that i have photos of. i texted her the entire time about how long i would be working and that i would be gone for all of wednesday to be safe. i went inland. didn’t go to work the next day; no one in my department did. thursday we all worked like normal. turned out that my manager told her boss, that i would be working from home the entire time. that i would be the one picking up the slack for them being out…. which i had no idea i was supposed to do. my manager even asked me the day before if i had a laptop; i told her i just have the desktop. then i got told i needed to be more committed and show up more. after the hurricane since i missed one day, she made me come in on a scheduled day off after i had an appointment with my sons school. then she took another day off on sunday after having tuesday and wednesday off due to the hurricane. i’m not sure why i have to work 6 days and my manager can work 4. i am very frustrated with her, i do have a lot of proof in texts and the edit history of that doc which she said something about in a group setting. i called her manager after she told me i was supposed to be working. i apologized to him and let him know that i had no idea that promise was made (i have proof via text that she just “thought” i would be working if i had power; which i didn’t at my apartment) i also have the text saying i didn’t have a laptop from the day prior. she also told me i shouldn’t have called him and that i was out of line. that it was a conversation with a manager and an employee that was that. that i didn’t need to go to her boss at all, i needed to go to her first. she was the one who caused the issue so i didn’t trust her say. is there something i can do? something that will protect me from being fired? she’s now writing notes in the group docs about a typo i made that she should have caught if they checked the notes. like she tells me i am supposed to do every time. i feel as though i am being targeted by my manager. she helps and assists the other girl in our department without a problem. i really do not know what to do to protect myself and my job going forward. if anyone has any advice i’d take it. i depend on this job and i’m in the process of buying a house; losing my job now would be devastating. tldr; my manager is lying and blaming things on me that i have proof aren’t true and it feel like i’m trying to be pushed out. can i do anything?",AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/16dl5iu/fl_my_manager_targets_me_and_lies_to_our_higher/,0
16dl4hl,is anyone familiar with bowel evacuation via colonoscopy?,"33m **tl;dr: this was recommended to me by an er doctor, but i'm having trouble finding out who does it and how to get it done.** context: i went to the er last week for constipation, thinking i might have a blockage. i didn't, but they did give me golytely. the doctor said if that didn't work, i should talk to my gi about having a bowel evacuation via colonoscopy. when i saw the gi, he said that hospitals were the ones that do that. upon returning to the er, the next doctor i saw said he hadn't heard of that procedure. are you familiar with it? does it go by any other names? more details/my dilemma: in the past week i've drank 6 liters of golytlely (2 at a time spaced a day or so apart) with no results (no diarrhea or fecal matter, just water came out), done 3 unsuccessful fleet enemas (2 saline and one mineral oil), as well as taken lactulose 3 times daily. this is on top of the routine my gi has me on (taking trulance, a stool softener, miralax twice a day, a probiotic, and daily metamusil). at this point, i'm not able to eat or drink very much due to becoming nausious afterward, which is resulting in feeling weak/shaky off and on. it also means i'm not intaking enough fiber or water every day, and, when feeling weak, i'm not able to get the exercise i need to help keep things moving either. i'm trying to get this resolved before it turns into an emergency. usually, an enema or 2 liters of golytlely does at least something toward that. now that that hasn't helped, i feel like i'm running out of options. i just saw my gi yesterday. he didn't have any other suggestions for immediate relief other than the mineral oil enema and taking doculax, which hasn't helped me in the past. as of my visit to the er last night, i still didn't have a blockage, but i was given a liter of saline solution through iv as well as digital disimpaction, neither of which produced results. if you're familiar with this bowel evacuation procedure or even something else that might work, i'd really appreciate any help you could provide!",AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/16dl4hl/is_anyone_familiar_with_bowel_evacuation_via/,0
16dkhii,is it even worth it anymore?,"i apologize for the length of this post, but i genuinely value and would appreciate your opinions. i've been thinking about this for a while now i'm a marine, and serving my country has always been a dream of mine. both of my parents were in the military and took part in the 2003 invasion of iraq. growing up, i was surrounded by old photos and stories, which turned me into a military and history enthusiast. instead of watching cartoons, i'd rather tune in to the history channel and documentaries. i know that i was quite an abnormal child. my love for our country and admiration for those on the frontlines, like the seals, became a driving force in my life. fast forward to after high school, i enlisted in the marines. i've always been focused on how i can shape myself to achieve my goals. what could make someone more mature, resilient, and a better individual and teammate in the future later in the teams? while i was in the process of joining the marines in 2021, the chaotic evacuation of afghanistan unfolded. watching it day by day, i couldn't help but see how conflicted the whole situation was. none of the military leaders took responsibility or were fired, not a single one. i knew that the military leadership had changed from what i had heard from my parents and the veterans i had met in my life, but i never expected it to be like this. and don't even get me started on the whole ""woke agenda"" debate. moving on, after graduating from boot camp, i headed to soi-west (school of infantry). during that time, there was the controversy surrounding the brittney griner prisoner exchange. i vividly remember watching it on the news in the chow hall, and i couldn't believe that our leaders chose to prioritize her over the marine prisoner held in russia. it left me feeling a mix of emotions, including frustration and a sense of hopelessness. it made me wonder if, in the unfortunate event that i were ever captured, would the u.s. do everything in its power to bring me back? as my curiosity grew, i found myself delving into research about topics like geopolitics and the events that brought us to this unusual period in our history as a country. our todays leaders are in a toss up between trying to quietly exit/retire or they are as woke as ever. we can all recall since the war on terror days ended we can all recall a dozen or more team guys and others in sof that were made examples by this same leadership i’m talking about. we’re letting society dictate and impede on what was always a standard. the military has lost its backbone and with that its respect from those within the ranks and those potential enlistees. it’s a daily reality that your serving along side this new generation. how confident are you in a war time scenario? the traditional model and purpose of serving is gone. i fully understand active duty in a non war era is a different environment. i’ve realized that fighting for the so call freedoms doesn’t exit anymore. i want to help people, i feel as though that it is my life’s purpose and the only way to have a direct 100% impact serving in the military/teams is going to tier 1 units like dam neck and cag. there is no civilian equivalent to the direct impact of helping others as an individual or as a team. law enforcement has its hands tied more than ever in vast politics and the same societal shit roes and sops. is it worth all of the things above that i have outlined from the leadership to the shit sops to the team cliques- and everything in between- is it worth going into the teams and furthermore is it worth the hell of staying for possible green team selection in pursuit of that direct impact i seek? is anyone else contemplating any of this? struggling with this and the balance or am i crazy? any recommendations that is remotely? the days of defense contracting as a middle ground between active duty and civilian “work” are over. i’m lost with it all. comments, i would love some input.",navyseals,https://www.reddit.com/r/navyseals/comments/16dkhii/is_it_even_worth_it_anymore/,0

16djo5v,initial data setup for inspection app," hello everyone, i'm an hr professional looking to assist our safety manager in improving his inspection process, and i could use some guidance. currently, he relies on a spreadsheet and carries his laptop around during inspections, which can be cumbersome. here's what we're aiming for: i want to create a more efficient and user-friendly inspection process. our safety manager isn't very tech-savvy, so i’m aiming for a solution that consolidates all data in one place for easy access. the existing spreadsheet contains 88 questions, and these questions remain consistent across all departments. the questions have a total of 4 different answers available. we have access to sharepoint, and i've dabbled in creating smaller apps using power apps in the past with sharepoint lists that contained 8-10 questions. however, i'm unsure about the best approach for handling 88 questions in this context. should each question become a column in sharepoint, and would the patch function be ideal for this? unfortunately, i don't have access to dataverse or sql due to our government account restrictions. learning power apps has become a hobby of mine, and i've enjoyed working on smaller apps for fun and learning. i see this as an opportunity to put my skills to practical use and make our safety manager's life easier. below are screenshots of the spreadsheet that is currently being used.

16dhmau,yesterday was an unmitigated disaster and i don't understand why,"first things first, the storm itself: nobody can control the weather and i get that. it was unexpectedly severe. people got hurt and stuff got damaged and destroyed. as a result brrf was put in the uncomfortable position of having to cancel shows for the night. that sucks real bad but you can't really blame brrf for that. ""get to the shuttles!"" for shelter is kind of silly and was never going to work. but hey, what else are they going to do? everybody has been talking about the lack of planning on brrf's part. they needed a real evacuation/weather plan. they needed to book more shuttles. they needed more water stations. they needed better ada accommodations. and all of that is true. and, even so, they could have made things 90% better for 90% of the people by just doing two simple and obvious things. 1) make people comfortable: after the storm has passed, there's no danger and no need to quickly evacuate. yet for some reason, they immediately tried to kick everyone out. but in doing so they made us all try to leave at the same time while giving us no real way of actually getting out. why? just let us hang out on the lawn or under the tents while we wait for the shuttle lines to die down. having to wait 4 hours for a shuttle is a very different experience if for 3 of those hours you're able to sit down, relax, have a couple drinks and dinner. if instead you're forced to stand on asphalt the entire time, it's a grueling nightmare. also, don't wait 3 hours to start handing out the bottles of water. 2) communicate: nobody had a clue what was going on. cell reception was atrocious. i get that that's likely a technical limitation with that many people overloading the networks. but what that means is we're entirely reliant upon the staff to let us know what's going on. all we were getting from staff was either conflicting information/directions or indifferent shrugs. both of those responses are completely unacceptable. tell your people what's going on and what we need to do and then have them disseminate that information. use the loudspeakers. tell us why there are delays. give us realistic wait times. and most importantly, you have to tell us what you're doing to make the situation better. if you're not doing anything to make the situation better, y'all are assholes. and if you don't tell us what you're doing, it seems like you're doing nothing. which means you look like assholes. don't look like assholes. it's so simple.",Blueridgerockfest,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blueridgerockfest/comments/16dhmau/yesterday_was_an_unmitigated_disaster_and_i_dont/,0

16df7rs,exhausting fumes outside in cold climate,"i'm trying to figure out how best to get fumes out of my home office where i have my x1c. venting outdoors really seems like a more foolproof approach compared to filtration to me. my printer is near a window, so i could run some dryer hose with an inline fan like others have done to evacuate the chamber after printing. my concern though is that because i am in a cold climate (near toronto), cold air will make its way back through the hose and into the build chamber, dropping the temp. i suppose one solution would be to have a constant low flow inline fan running to make sure no air from outside seeps in. but then i'll still be lowering chamber temperature because room air will be drawn into the build chamber. and the stuff i print does appreciate a hot chamber (thick walled petg parts). does anyone have any suggestions for this kind of scenario? anyone else exhausted fumes in a cold climate specifically? i do like the thought of venting outside. but if you think i'm being overcautious, i'd like to hear your thoughts. maybe it is just fine to use something like a bentobox combined with a hepa filter running in the same room... i mainly just print petg, tpu, pla+. thanks! &#x200b; edit: i am really liking the idea of just attaching 4"" dryer hose and then having a draft blocker to decrease cold air getting in when the printer is off. if anyone has tested this in a cold climate, please let me know how it worked out. also, i'm wondering if anyone has used an air quality sensor to see if simply relying on the chamber fan to push air outside through 4"" hose works well. i'm concerned that it might not create enough negative pressure inside the chamber to prevent fumes from getting out the poop shoot etc. and directly into the room.",BambuLab,https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/16df7rs/exhausting_fumes_outside_in_cold_climate/,0

16ddk9w,aitah for kicking my best friend of 7 years out of mine and my bf's apartment?,"hi, long time reader first time poster! over a month ago my best friend of 7 years (27 f) broke up with her boyfriend of over a year because he cheated on her with his ex-wife and got her pregnant. my friend has had a struggle with finding love. she is a beautiful fit woman who is into nutrition, exercising and yoga. but she always seems to fall in love with and move too quickly on men who don't appreciate her true beautiful spirt. the back story is my friend found this guy on hinge and started talking to him around her birthday. he came out to her celebration to meet her friends for the very first time. me (29 f) and my boyfriend (29 m) decided to chat with him to get to know him better. he just moved to florida from colorado and we decided to ask him what his favorite thing about florida was. his responce was ""the chicks here are really hot""... we both found his answer odd as he was getting serious with my best friend but we shrugged it off. fast forward to 4 months of them dating they decided to move in with each other. i warned my friend that this was not a good idea and that she should wait. of course she decided to not listen and went ahead and they moved with each other. about a month before their lease was up her boyfriend decided to tell her that he didn't think he was in love with her. that caused her to get upset and she came to stay with my boyfriend and i for that week which also happened to be my birthday. while she stayed with me and i tried to emotionally support her on my birthday he went home to colorado to go to the nuggets parade. \*\*they did not officially break up. once he got back from colorado he apologized to her and promised that he would work harder on their relationship and try to mend things so they decided not renew their current lease (thankfully) and look for a new apartment for a ""fresh start"". 4-5 weeks later her boyfriend gets a text from his ex-wife that she is pregnant. apparently, this was a premeditated action that took place while he was in colorado for the parade. this all happened after her and her boyfriend took back to back vacations and she spent a lot of money on her credit cards. she is a bartender and teaches yoga on the side so she is in pretty severe debt. my boyfriend and i agreed to let her live in our spare bedroom where she would have her own bathroom rent free for 1.5-2 months. we just asked her to pay our utilities ($200/month) so she could take the time to work and help pay off her debt/ build money for a security deposit on a new place. before she moved in my boyfriend and i had a discussion with our neighbors who are both single males (one of them being my boyfriend’s cousin) about how she is vulnerable spot and that we asked them not to try to pursue her while she is staying with us. they both agreed to our wishes as they know we are looking out for them and her and didn't want to cause any kind of rift in our friendship. i also talked to my friend in person that i talked to the guys and told them to not try anything with you and i gave her the same talk that both of those men were off limits while she lives with us rent free. she told me i had nothing to worry about because she wasn’t attracted to either of them and they she has already found a booty call and was working on finding more. she moved in and everything was fine for a while. i was getting concerned that she was calling out of work for no real reason and talking to me about wanting to get more tattoos, spend money on these expensive yoga classes and start a gym membership at this really expensive place up the road from us. she was also talking to me about getting an office job before she moved into her own place. i warned her that i didn't think that would be a good idea because she would probably make less money starting out and that apartments look at job history. it would be best if she stayed at her current job to find a new place then once she is situated with her bills to then try and pursue a office job. here is where it all went down: we live in tampa in a zone a location and we had hurricane ian approaching us. now, i was born and raised here in the tampa area so since it wasn't hitting us directly i really wasn't concerned about evacuating. tuesday night me, my boyfriend, my friend and our two male neighbors decided to throw a hurricane party with just the five of us since we all worked from home on wednesday. we were drinking having a good time, did a little micro-dose and hung out. i noticed that my friend and my boyfriend’s cousin were getting a little flirty. i shrugged it off because they have met before and i know she is naturally flirty. the night goes on and it’s raining and my friend and my boyfriend’s cousin decided they wanted to go to the pool. no one else wanted to go so whatever. i went with my friend back to our apartment so she could put her bathing suit on and as she was doing that i was like ""hey, you are getting really flirty with my boyfriend’s cousin, remember he’s off limits do you mind backing off a bit."" her response to me verbatim was ""oh i know i can be a bit flirty but i remember he's off limits. i don't find him attractive at all, i'll back down."" so, i was like cool we have been besties for a while i trust her. i guess my boyfriend had the same reminder conversation with his cousin and he confirmed that he knows not to hook up with her. they go to the pool and i went to bed. my boyfriend and the other male neighbor decided to roll a joint and meet them out there not even 20 minutes later. welp, they did the deed. they were caught then ran to my boyfriend’s cousins’ room to lock the door and continue f'ing each other. my boyfriend was absolutely furious as we felt betrayed and lied to. a lot more went down that night but i was sleeping so unsure of the exact story. but my friend actually bit the other male neighbor because she was being loud and crazy and he asked her to shut up while he was trying to go to bed... the next day rolls around and we ask her why she did what she did (we know she initiated it and aggressively went after him). her response was that she is an adult and she can do whatever she wants. she told us that we were manipulating her to who she can and cannot sleep it. i said as her best friend i had one request while i let her live with us rent free and she deliberately betrayed my trust and lied to my face not even 20 minutes before. my boyfriend was extremely mad and wanted her out. so, i kicked her out and said be gone by friday. she was upset because i know she truly had nowhere to go. her family is out of the question and she only had a few close friends. i know as a best friend if the roll was reversed and she asked me to not sleep with someone i would take that so seriously because my friendship means more to me than a quick fuck. &#x200b; she ended up finding a coworker to stay with for the time being and this event got me reminiscing on our 7 years of friendship. i have always been the one to drop what i am doing to come to her rescue. i have always been the one to pick up and mend the pieces after someone broke her heart. i feel like i have never received the same acts of friendship in return. when things were good for her i would be the one reaching out to make plans that she would accept then bail on me an hour before multiple times but hang out with another girl (that i know but am not close with by choice) instead. i have always felt responsible over her because i know she has issues with her family and not the best relationship background but since kicking her out i have felt such relief. i need friends who are in the same chapter as i am which is in a serious relationship, a good career, looking to buy a home and start a family. i rarely go out/party/drink anymore and if that is what she is still into i think this is a sign that even after 7 years it’s okay to say goodbye to someone who i though was my friend but i was blind to what our friendship actually was. aitah? &#x200b;

16dddfy,i exploded. literally.,"i'm bot sure if this was a homebrew dnd campaign or its own system (it was nearly 10 years ago.), but my group played a game of starcraft. this story isn't very long since it only lasted a session, so i won't go into characters too much. there were 3 or so combat characters and 3 non-combat characters. i was one of the non-combat characters, a good aligned trader. the other two were evil aligned, and played it pretty well. very soon after we started, the zerg started to swarm the main military base of the planet we started on and the military called for a full evacuation. us three traders were in a suburb a few miles away, preparing to leave when we heard the announcement. i immediately decide its time to go, but the other two find a strange egg they believe might sell for some money and try to load it into their truck. after failing to convince them we need to leave now, i start to leave myself, on foot because they were the owners of the truck. the two evil players decide that i will most likely snitch on them for carrying contraband and decide they need to silence me. they jump in the truck and try to run me over, but i get tackled out of the way by something. getting up, the dm says my arm is missing, cut off by the zergling that just slammed me into a wall. (ooc i'm not too worried about this because it's a technologically advanced universe and i'm looking forward to a robot arm) i try to shove the zergling off of me but lose my other arm. the two traders realize they missed me and spin around for a second pass, but instead plow into the zergling just before it takes off my head. adrenaline pumping, i manage to jump in the bed of the truck before they drive too far away and they finally decide to head to the base. by the time we make it to the base, the full zerg army is gathered in front, led by a broodmother. the driver slids the truck in front of the base, the bed facing the entry gate. i thought they had a change of heart and were gonna help me get inside, so i begin to stand. instead, the driver drops a brick on the accelerator and the two bail as the truck hurtles into the swarm. the truck crashes into an ultralisk and explodes, my character still in the bed. the dm assured me that i wasn't dead, that i would become basically the next kerrigan and be an antagonist to the group, but we switched over to a legend of zelda campaign the next week and never played it again.

""is it because we'll run out?"" i had to take a pause. climate change has been on my mind since we broke the record for hottest day on july 3. my phone has notified me of heat exposure warnings in my area almost every day since. many evenings and afternoons have been spent reading climate change articles and even threads on how to prepare for the upcoming famine and drought. i asked my 5yo to shut off the water because we have to pay for the water we use, but to an extent, he was onto something. i have gotten to the point in my climate-change anxiety story where it's affecting my day-to-day. playing with my 5yo feels muted because i'm thinking about how *this* is the moment i will be looking back at fondly when the grocery store shelves are empty. *this* is the good ol' days to the version of myself one decade in the future. i imagine myself holding one of my two children explaining to them why we don't have enough for them to eat. this is a reality for many *today* and as a first-world parent, i feel even more guilt for not having given more attention to the plight of those parents in other parts of the world who have evacuated their town or country because of flood or uprising. at the same time, my 5yo started kindergarten in a new school last month. driving by his previous school immediately sent me to tears unexpectedly. i felt like i was mourning the younger version of my child that no longer exists. random crying episodes such as this one are becoming more frequent. then i look at my newborn as she sweetly smiles to me every morning. when she hears the sudden bark of my dog and has the shocked look on her face, her eyes darting to me immediately because she knows i'm the one responsible for keeping her safe. and then i wonder if i can keep her safe in a world i was never prepared to thrive in. i go to work doing the same work i've been doing for the past nine years, where before jobs felt routine and now the thought of ""will this be the last one?"" is constantly at the back of my mind. every morning is a reminder that the upcoming travesty is rapidly becoming a reality, and not just a nightmare from the night before. i guess i just need to get all of this out of my head and share it with fellow likeminded parents who might be going through the same thoughts and emotions. thanks for letting me share.",Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/16d8glk/unable_to_stop_feeling_guilt_regarding_climate/,0

15w2opq,just a little post where people can roast the smoke.,"hey, smoke, you think you’re so cool just because james dean and clint eastwood used to inhale you. but deep down inside you know you’re dirty, disgusting and nothing but an annoyance. sure, they say that during a drought you can take a smoke bath. you know who takes smoke baths these days? nobody. we have soaps with lotions and creams. you, on the other hand, are good for making beef jerky. i don’t want to smell like beef jerky. it’s not a flattering perfume. you’re the worst thing about a campfire. like an unwanted guest at a cocktail party you hover and mingle in the faces of people who just want to roast their weenies, perhaps toast their buns on the metal grill and keep warm. but no…you gotta get up in everybody’s faces and make people crazy until they start screaming nonsensical words like *white rabbits* over an over again like inmates at the hickory farms insane asylum. i was walking down enterprise earlier today and there was this dude screaming *white rabbits! i hate white rabbits!* at the top of his lungs. he wasn’t a crazy street person. he wasn’t on drugs. he said he was the freaking mayor. i asked the mayor, “what’s wrong?” i shook his hand and said, “you’re doing a good job. this smoke isn’t your fault. none of this is your fault…” “white rabbits…white rabbits. they used to be on enterprise, but now they are on harvey and only i can see them!” maybe that guy wasn’t really the mayor. perhaps he was crazy. or perhaps you made him crazy, smoke. do you want to know why people say *i hate white rabbits* when you get all up in our faces? well, it’s an interesting story that dates itself to the boy scouts. apparently a camp councillor told the kids that smoke was made of billions of tiny white rabbits, fluttering about in random trajectories by the wind and the heat of the flames. the story gained enough traction to become an urban legend. but the real question we have to ask is, what the hell were you doing hanging around with a bunch of underage children, smoke? and why were you prancing around their bodies doings little seductive dances? if you don’t quit that behaviour ronan farrow gonna write a *vanity fair* article about you. okay, i will concede you do make a hotdog taste better. but why must you insist on smoking all the humans? what are you planning, smoke? why are you trying to seal in all our succulent juices? i think it is time to leave town, smoke. while you might be the inspiration for wayne wang’s second best movie, your time has come to pass. the problem is you are lazy. you just sit there, doing nothing like a nihilistic teen asking adults if they can by them cigarettes outside the 7-11. you have no skills outside of flavouring meats and signalling nomadic hunter gatherers when they can’t find their iphones. and yet, some day soon a hard rain will fall, or perhaps a mild breeze will dance down this valley and carry you away. and as you drift away from our memories until next fire season, remember: you are not made of little rabbits. you are a suspension of airborne particles and gasses mixed with air. technically you are an unwanted byproduct of fire. that’s right, smoke, even fire doesn’t want your lazy ass hanging around. and neither do we.",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/15w2opq/just_a_little_post_where_people_can_roast_the/,0

15w0atz,how to diy an air purifier to filter smoke,"if you are in kelowna or west kelowna and struggling to find an air purifier or just cant afford one, there is an easy diy solution. if you have a window ac unit, floor (portable, with tubes) ac unit, or even an old box fan, all you need is a furnace filter. i used one of these: [ LINK this is similar to the corsi-rosenthal box concept created during the covid 19 pandemic, however it only uses one filter instead of 4 and uses equipment that many people already have. i don't know many people who have box fans, but i know countless people with portable/window ac units. the boxes are undoubtedly better, but this still works and is much cheaper and easier to make. simply pick a filter that fits your ac's interior air intake closely in one dimension, and then cut it to size in the other dimension. in this case a 16 inch wide filter fit my unit perfectly, i just had to cut it in half to fit the vertical dimension. then, making sure you align the airflow direction arrow correctly (these are directional filters) tape it to the unit with whatever you have. i used some aluminium tape because i wanted to do a fairly neat job, but you can use duct tape, electrical tape, or anything else that will hold it on. the suction will pull the filter against the unit, you just want to seal off as many gaps as possible so that most of the air goes through the filter. you can usually get two uses out of a single filter, so it's cost effective, with the filters usually costing $20-$30 each. i usually have to replace them during smoke season once per month, your mileage may vary depending on your ac. mine is a 12,000 btu toshiba unit from 2019, and does an excellent job of moving lots of air, and in my experience has beat out a $250 danby purifier with one of these filters. you can also do this with an industrial box fan that can be purchased for cheap at most hardware stores and are normally not in super high demand as they are large and can be loud, so find one that is bearable for you and accept the tradeoff of a bit more noise for cleaner air. you can always run it during the day when you are away from home and turn it off when you get back, it'll still filter a lot of air in that time. keep in mind if your ac has an especially weak fan, this may not work super well, and may trip the machine's circuit protection, causing it to pulse the fan. i've had this happen with another machine, and the solution was to leave a gap at the edges, after which it worked fine and still managed to turn the filter entirely dark brown after the fire season in 2021 so it did obviously still did something. LINK stay safe out there, and my sincerest condolences to those who have lost properties to the fire. stay strong kelowna",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/15w0atz/how_to_diy_an_air_purifier_to_filter_smoke/,0

15vvgac,emergency mental health tips," as a community, we are going through what are likely some of the most harrowing days of our lives thus far. my heart goes out to everyone who is on the front lines, who has been evacuated, who is anxiously anticipating the further unfolding of events, and who is offering help to those in need. friends and neighbours, we are in this together! i am a registered clinical counsellor who lives and works in kelowna. during my masters in counselling, i did extensive research into the mental health impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. based on my research, here are a few practical tips we can use to support ourselves and each other during this truly unsettling, truly unprecedented time: 1. **connect with your community.** coming together in community is one of the best things we can do in this dire situation. if you are able, find ways to help people out by donating to support agencies, offering space in your home for evacuees, or volunteering your time. 2. **lean into relationships.** when you are able, be a support to others by reaching out, talking with them, helping them out if needed, and making yourself available. when you need support, reach out to friends, family, and loved ones. there are always people who are able to offer help and people who need assistance! 3. **talk about your feelings.** any emotional response you are having is normal and valid. if you are afraid, that is completely understandable; if you find yourself in emotional denial, that’s normal too; or if you are feeling positive, energetic, and eager to help - also a normal response! everyone’s nervous system reacts differently to emergencies. again, the best thing we can do is lean into our communities in whatever capacity we have. 4. **know whose mental health is at risk.** not everyone is at equal risk of developing adverse mental health during extreme weather events. anyone who lives in close relationship with the land is at higher risk. this includes indigenous peoples, farmers, outdoor workers, and anyone who is concerned about the environment. minority groups, individuals with a history of trauma, and individuals with already present mental health concerns are also at heightened risk. take a moment to think about who you know that falls into one of these categories; if you are able, reach out to them. 5. **be aware of long-term mental health impacts.** individuals who have past experience with traumatic events and/or extreme weather can develop longer-term mental health challenges such as acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome, or post-traumatic stress disorder. these conditions do not always develop right away; it can take up to a year or more for symptoms to emerge. don’t be afraid though - mental health struggles are treatable! be aware of symptoms associated with these challenges. if you notice symptoms developing in yourself or someone you know, reach out for professional support. also be aware that experiences of extreme weather and natural disaster can become cumulative, leaving an individual at higher risk of developing adverse mental health in the future. 6. **advocate for climate action.** human-caused climate change is making extreme weather such as wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, and floods more frequent and more severe. if you are concerned about climate change then find ways to advocate for climate action. here are some ideas: write to your elected officials, write letters to the editors of your local news outlets, join a climate advocacy group like one listed below, and talk with family, friends, and loved ones about your climate concerns. research suggests that the one of best things we can do is to use our collective anger, grief, and anxiety to fuel conversations about climate action.

15ulk2y,insurance helpful hint,"your home insurance will have a civil authority extension. most last for 2 weeks. if you need to evacuate because of civil authority they will pay your expenses. hotel, meals etc. save all of your receipts. your insurers will all be very busy as most are cross canada insurers. if they have an app try submitting your claim online. please know adjusters deal with a lot of trauma and are overworked because of this. emotions are high and will be crazy high over this. if you do not have home insurance try red cross or any other legitimate agencies. people will be trying to scam those affected. watch out for texts asking you to click on a link or random people asking for your bank details to deposit money. most insurers have your bank details already. and some even do eft. i visited kelowna last week as i have family there. it instantly became my favorite place in the world, i was depressed because i had to come back to my home. my family has evacuated and they are safe, thank god. please stay safe.",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/15ulk2y/insurance_helpful_hint/,0

166jeek,nearing end of season personal financing,"worthiest of bros and brodettes, i am returned once again to impart some financial knowledge for your end of season. while you were all waiting for fire season (finally here) i studied the blade. big shouts out to santaclaus hotshots, saw you boys flowing north as i ripped south to go get fucked up at a wedding in napa, so happy day 5/6, get that paper. instead of blowing up this sub every couple of weeks, i decided maybe it would be better to give you totally unsolicited advice when it comes to personal finances at the end of the season before y'all do something dumb with your money. up to you all if you want to use it or not. to be clear - i'm not telling you to yolo your fire season into 0dte calls on amc, that would be 100p on you. this is simply an attempt to help you grow your wealth and not go into next fire season broke. &#x200b; * if you have a retirement account with your agency and they match your contributions, awesome, you're a good little saver! it's free money so don't leave it on the table. if you do **not** have a retirement account or refuse to let the government invest on your behalf (i don't blame you) here is what i would do: * go to your bank or another financial institution and open a roth ira. you can contribute $6,500 annually unless you make over $153,000 as a single tax filer ($228,000 for y'all married folks/joint filers). roth ira's give you the benefit of using post-tax income and you wont have to pay any subsequent income tax in the future on any gains from your investments. additionally, a roth has zero penalties if used before retirement for education expenses and financing a home will only require around 3% down. pretty neat, innit? * determine your investment style and objectives. i commented on someones post about this earlier this season and included it here. buy low sell high. * [how to think about your investments]( LINK * debts * know the difference between ""good debt"" and ""bad debt."" pay off your bad debt first while making the minimum payments on your good debt to avoid getting murdered by interest rates. * good debt - anything less than 5% * bad debt - anything over 5% edit: good debt would also include something that gains intrinsic/extrinsic value like student loans, mortgages, business loans. bad debt would be thing that depreciate in value such as a vehicle or a credit card. one loses value while the other has an absolutely jacked interest rate. * the 1x1 or 2x rule * do you ever feel guilty about making a frivolous purchase after the season ends? me either, thats why i have a tikka t3x a1 tactical in 6.5 with a viper pst gen ii mrad scope and harris bipod. but on the flip side of that, any time i make a ""large"" purchase out of pure hedonism i also put the same amount (or more) into my retirement/investments. this way i don't feel so bad about being a degenerate. whatever you are willing to spend on yourself, double it. now you'll be wealthier in the years to come and you have a new snowmobile (its a 2012 skidoo but its new to you). * broad based exposure, long term perspective * you are absolutely not going to beat the investment banks or hedge funds. many have tried and few have succeeded. capturing alpha in a world where there is less and less every day is a fools gambit. trust me, i've been doing quantitative analysis on stocks for years and if theres anything i have learned its that markets and banks will stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent. * example - backtest to 1982, if you had invested $10,000 in the s&p that would be worth $1.5m today * etf's, index funds, and mutual funds are your friend here. they are very similar as far as structure where you own a bundle of stocks rather than one on its own. much more tolerant to risk and negative volatility. * dividend snowball * dividends are just payments companies make to investors for owning their assets, not all companies pay them out but there are some powerhouse companies out there that return astounding amounts of capital over time. * for example - you bought 10 shares of company abc for $100/ea. abc pays you a 4% annual dividend on a quarterly basis (4% for the year, 1% every three months). while $40 doesn't seem like a lot, you are essentially buying 40% of one stock in your first year and as it pays out over time that will compound into more shares and higher payout so long as you hold onto your shares. * it may look small now but the power of compound interest and dividend reinvestment will grow overtime. this is almost exactly how berkshire is structured now. warren doesn't really seek out individual winners or hedge risk anymore because the portfolio generates insane amounts of free cash flow. stick with it for the long run and keep stacking it up. thats all i have for you. think of investing as sacrificing some purchasing power today for way more purchasing power down the road. it's the difference between financing an f-250 king ranch right now vs paying cash somewhere down the road. with any luck, some of y'all will put away 10% of your cash to make it more bigger. use that information as you will and i hope you all have a safe rest of your season. be the american the japanese believe you to be. also shouts out to all the contractors who got butthurt when i told the goggins wannabe to go suck his dick. keep it up and one day you’ll be able to pass the fitness test. i hate you and i hope you have a horrible christmas.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/166jeek/nearing_end_of_season_personal_financing/,0

1618zoh,bc wildfire service pull firefighters out of north shuswap after protestors confront rcmp," in case of paywall: british columbia has pulled firefighting crews out of the north shuswap area after a group of protesters confronted rcmp at a highway checkpoint, where the demonstrators argued the mounties do not have the authority to block people from entering a wildfire evacuation zone. forrest tower, a spokesperson for bc wildfire service, on thursday confirmed the wednesday evening retreat and attributed it, in part, to the protesters on the trans-canada highway near sorrento. the crews were reassigned to neighbouring firefighting efforts and have not yet returned. bcws said the protest, in an area where tension between local residents and fire officials is high, put its teams in danger. a video of the shuswap clash, posted on facebook, shows a small group challenging rcmp officers at a checkpoint, with orange pylons and what appears to be a spike belt separating the two sides. jeff rosner, a sicamous resident who recorded the incident, said the crowd members attended the checkpoint to seek answers about the fire. they tried to bring supplies such as food and fuel to friends inside the evacuation zone who remained to defend their property, he added. the protest was reminiscent of those that unfolded during the pandemic, when some people opposed to covid-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates banded together to challenge politicians and those who enforce the law. misinformation, a distrust of authority and the belief that individual rights trump all defined the extended pandemic protests – and the themes resurfaced on the video of the wednesday clash. derek sutherland, the head of protective services at the columbia shuswap regional district, said that while local community members have not always agreed with how fire officials have managed fires in the area, north shuswap residents told him they reject the group that gathered at the police barricade. “they are not supportive of this freedom convoy that was coming to the area,” mr. sutherland said. local residents, he said, were not part of the confrontation. mr. rosner, on the other hand, said everyone in the crowd was from the shuswap area, including evacuees. janis smith, a celista resident, said the agitators should leave the community: “i don’t know who they are and what they are trying to accomplish but they are making it worse, so if they could just go home that would be great.” rcmp, in a statement thursday, said no one was arrested and that the mounties do not expect to press any charges: “it appeared that the intentions of those involved were to overwhelm the police road block and gain access to the area.” police have increased their presence in the area in response to what they described as “ongoing efforts by some individuals who have undermined bc wildfire service fire suppression work through the movement of vital equipment, and have compromised emergency personnel safety through threats of violence.” the area, rcmp said, is not safe because of the threat from wildfires, as well as damage to power lines and unstable trees and buildings. mr. tower, bcws’s information officer, said fire officials considered a number of factors, including the protest, before pulling crews out of the north shuswap area and temporarily reassigning them to other parts of the bush creek east and rossmoore lake wildfires. bcws, on social media wednesday, said it was aware of an “organized effort to dismantle” an rcmp checkpoint. “this is the latest of several decisions that have significantly impacted operational activities in the area. at this time, the environment is unsafe for bcws operations,” the post said, adding it would pull crews out of the north shuswap area. “this decision was not made lightly. the safety of people is our primary concern.” the bcws posts, which appeared shortly before 10 p.m., were quickly deleted. mr. tower said bcws made the posts based on information from rcmp and other partners. as it was posted, rcmp informed bcws that the “situation that we were describing was not as serious in the moment,” mr. tower said. bcws opted to delete, rather than revise, the post “in an effort to not give something steam that didn’t, and doesn’t, deserve to have it,” he said. “we know the power of social media in terms of making something bigger than it might be.” mr. tower said crews were constructing a fireguard near sorrento prior to leaving the area. bcws estimated it had about two days worth of work left to do there once crews return, he said. fire behaviour in the area was not “significant or concerning” thursday and while ground crews have moved out, mr. tower said that helicopters continue to work on the entire bush creek east blaze.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/1618zoh/bc_wildfire_service_pull_firefighters_out_of/,0

15wxe7s,days off and district days to an incident.,"i noticed that some modules on my district were taking days off before leaving on an predetermined assignment to ""reset"". their reasoning is that since they have been working multiple days on district they need to reset before they leave so they don't go over on the maximum days worked for the length of an assignment. i was always under the impression that days worked on district would not affect the length of your assignment and they started once you arrived on scene for your assignment. of course it's nice to take days off before leaving for a couple weeks but i never believed it was actually necessary. i can't find anything that's specifically talks about going from home unit to an assignment though. what is everyone else's take on this? some references: according the the red book for forest service maximum consecutive days worked – home unit... fs – during extended periods of activity in support of local fire management, personnel will have a minimum of 2 days off in any 14-day period. interagency business management handbook (yellow book) management directed days off at home unit supervisors must manage work schedules for initial attack, dispatch, and incident support personnel during extended incident situations. during periods of non-routine or extended activity, these employees will have a minimum of 1 day off in any 21-day period. this minimum requirement should rarely be needed since scheduled days off are normally given much more frequently during periods of routine activity.... indicators of the need for a day off include long shifts, but equally important, the actual observation of the physical and mental condition of the employee.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/15wxe7s/days_off_and_district_days_to_an_incident/,0

15s1kvl,nffe is not your friend,"nffe isn't our friend or an even actual union. they are a placeholder for where an actual union should be. we should never forget that we have had nffe for decades, and if it wasn't for grwff, anchorpoint, and orher out spoken individuals, we wouldn't have anything to show for it, no pay raise, no incident pay, no congressional hearings, nothing. nffe spends more time on reddit and other social media accounts than iaff and has nothing to show for it. nffe is an afl-cio union, which means that as long as we are 'represented' by nffe, we will never be allowed to join/form another union under the threat of nffe suing the competing union. nffe has claimed in this very subreddit that they work closely with iaff, and yet i know for a fact that most of the people running iaff have legitimately never even heard of nffe. might have something to do with the fact that iaff is a firefighters union, wheras nffe is an aircraft mechanics union that has grown into a disgusting overgrown monster representing far too many employees and departments to ever be able to focus on us and our individual needs. iaff recently secured 'forever pay raises' for calfire, you know, the people who were already making twice as much money as us 'forestry techs'. what federal firefighters need is a federal firefighters union. this can only be accomplished by us absolving ourselves entirely from nffe and forming new iaff locals in our various forests and regions. this is a tall order but its entirely possible. the wheels are already in motion in certain locations, but this really needs to be a coordinated national effort.",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/15s1kvl/nffe_is_not_your_friend/,0

15qbimh,anyone looking for a battle buddy/accountability buddy for applying for firefighting positions?,"hi all-new here. i'm an army veteran and was in tech for awhile after getting out, but feeling the call to serve again. one of my army buddies did 5 years on a ihc before he joined and he said it was the best job he ever had. his bearing and calm attitude while we were even deployed says a lot about how being on a handcrew can develop your character. i've been talking to a few superintendents, especially for veterans crews and watching usajobs and am serious about applying for winter season in the east and '24 summer in the west. in previous things that i've done (i.e. ranger school, getting out of the army and getting into tech, starting my business), i've found it's helpful to have a ""battle buddy"" ie someone to train together and keep each other accountable. i'm a little older (mid-30s) but in pretty good shape (did a 9:25 1.5 mi during my assessment last week) and i've been following this mountain tactical institute prep program: [ LINK i'm in los angeles area, but happy to make internet friends if we can help each other succeed. and it goes without saying, any advice from old-timers is always appreciate",Wildfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/15qbimh/anyone_looking_for_a_battle_buddyaccountability/,0
