16f47ll,"british american tobacco: heads i win, tails i…still win","hello, fellow investors! &#x200b; i have recently added british american tobacco to my portfolio as i believe that its current share price presents an exceptionally compelling risk-reward proposition when weighed against alternative investment opportunities. following is a concise summary of my reasoning that i would like to present for your feedback. **the best opportunities are to be found in bear markets** sooner or later, regardless of how exceptional they are, companies find themselves in the midst of multi-year downturns. it happened to coca cola, pepsico, microsoft, and apple, just to name a few. the only time british american tobacco has been cheaper than today was at the end of the largest civil litigation settlement in u.s. history, which resulted in the tobacco companies paying the states and territories billions of dollars in yearly instalments. *it went then on to become a* ***15-bagger*** *over the subsequent 17 years,* ***not accounting for dividends***. now, the company does currently face noteworthy challenges (i.e. negative secular trends in smoking and a substantial debt burden), but the current valuation seems to be factoring in a higher level of risk than may actually exist. **declining smoking rates** even though smoking rates continue to decline, the company is effectively offsetting the trend through a successful diversification of its product portfolio. the oligopolistic nature of tobacco markets also gives them significant pricing power, especially since demand for their products is relatively inelastic, resulting in inordinate profitability and robust cash flows. **debt burden** the company has debt maturities of around £4 billion annually in the next two years, and due to higher interest rates, net finance costs are expected to increase as debts are refinanced. however, it currently holds about £4 billion in cash, expects to generate at least an additional £5+ billion in post-dividend free cash flow, and had access to an undrawn £5.5 billion revolving credit facility as of 30 june 2023. this sums up to more than £14 billion in liquidity available to meet its debt obligations within the specified time frame. contrary to claims of insolvency, the company's financials demonstrate otherwise. **heads i win, tails i...still win** it does not happen very often that companies with cash flows so consistent and predictable offer a ***fcf yield of 17%***. not to mention the fact that they're still growing earnings and that a multiple expansion is not unlikely over the next decade (in 2000, the company traded at just 7x earnings before eventually returning to its historical norm of 13 to 14x). this is an ***immensely-wide moat and non-cyclical stock*** ***currently paying a 9% dividend yield*** with a conservative 60% earnings payout ratio and a well-established track record of dividend payments spanning many decades. investors are getting average stock market returns from the dividend alone. i wanted to keep the post short and focus on the company's primary key facts, but i hope nonetheless you found the information interesting and worthy of further exploration!",stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16f47ll/british_american_tobacco_heads_i_win_tails_istill/

""because a bullet to the head is quick and painless. meanwhile, burning to death is widely considered one of the slowest and most painful ways you can die on my planet."" &#x200b; okay that one really sobered him up. he even seemed to balk.

""yes. we feel pain. every living being does."" &#x200b; *i really am talking to a preschooler!* &#x200b; ""psshh! no way. does this hurt?"" &#x200b; and then, without warning, the drunkard actually did it. he jabbed those claws of his right into my arm. thankfully it wasn't enough to brake the skin, but it would definitely leave a mark. and yes, it did in fact, hurt like hell. &#x200b; ""gah! fuck! yes that hurt asshole!"" &#x200b; my sudden howl of pain made the whole bar jump back. you could hear a pin drop in the silence that followed. the drunk gojid, realizing just how much he'd fucked around, seemed to be completely quivering in fear at the thought of finding out. but before it could come to that, a bottle was slammed onto the bar between us. if dohkar was a judge, that was his gavel bringing the court to order. &#x200b; ""that's enough! i'm cuttin' you off scullen. anyone willing to pick a fight with a human either has predator disease or is far to drunk for their own good."" &#x200b; the look of betrayal on that drunkard's face was by far the most hilarious thing i'd seen in days. i wish i had a camera just so i could create the next ""surprised pikachu"" meme. &#x200b; ""b-but, t-the predator he-"" &#x200b; he got cut off with another slam of the bottle. ""is a paying customer just like you. predator or no, his money's just as good here as yours. and unlike some people, he actually pays his tab. meanwhile, you approached first, you started the conversation, and you threw the first blow. the fact that your judgement is clearly far too impaired for you to be responsible for your actions is the only reason i haven't thrown you out on your prickly ass."" &#x200b; his gaze shifted to me, ""as for you, i'd ask you to kindly keep the ungodly roaring to a minimum. and i don't just mean your singing."" &#x200b; **why you cheeky little-** &#x200b; *no. he's got a point.* &#x200b; ""sorry dohk. this stuff just gets old after a while, but that's no reason to cause a scene. kinda hard to prove i'm not a monster when i'm screaming at drunkards to spehfaced for their own good. here's my tab for the night. thanks for letting me play again."" &#x200b; i used my pad to transfer the funds to the bar, an affirmative ping from dohk's own pad signaled the transaction as complete. he gave me a nod as i picked up my guitar and turned to leave. &#x200b; ""be sure to send my regards to ms. teylim for me."" &#x200b; i smirked under my helmet before calling back to him. ""she's never gonna say yes, dohk, but i'll let her know you said hi."" &#x200b; i heard the the signature whistle of a venlil chuckle, ""begone from my establishment, ape!"" &#x200b; the sunlight refracted from my helmet as i walked out onto the street. venlil prime's permanent sunrise made having a solid sleep schedule almost impossible. tey helped by teaching me the federation time structure and showing me how to sync to my pad. i honestly don't think i'd have made it this long on vp without her help. i'd been on this planet for just over a month now and honestly, i hated it. once the grandiose sci-fi mystique got old, it got real easy to start seeing just how...wrong everything was. &#x200b; *and to think, it started so well at first.* &#x200b; here's a challenge for you. you want to blow a venlil's mind? try explaining what sign language is to them. they will either start wracking their brain, trying to figure out how they hadn't created it yet, or just think you're insane. well, i'm a human so they already think i'm insane, but you get the point. in fact, it's almost hilarious the amount of things they don't have. &#x200b; police forces? nope, you get paranoid jerks with flamethrowers. &#x200b; emergency responders of any kind? nope, get trampled, bitch. &#x200b; sign language, brail, or any other communication medium for people who need it? nope, let their herd handle it. &#x200b; and if they don't? sucks to be you. &#x200b; mental health institutes? how does 40,000 volts strike ya? &#x200b; i have been in this rathole town for weeks and i have yet to see a single wheelchair ramp! the paragons of empathy everyone! may we all be so lucky to be in their care! what a fucking joke! actually, no, jokes are funny. this, this is just pathetic. &#x200b; **i warned you.** &#x200b; *but what would i know about empathy, right?* *i'm a predator! nevermind the fact that we only attacked the cradle because they were gonna nuke us first, or the fact that we saved as many civilians as we could before the arxur showed up. or the fact that we then evacuated them again when the federation decided to nuke us anyways. nope! i eat lab-grown meat occasionally which means i am completely devoid of all emotion except hunger and hate!* &#x200b; *i'm a monster!* &#x200b; **worthless.** &#x200b; *i'm a thing!* &#x200b; **useless.** &#x200b; *i'm an abomination!* &#x200b; **burden.** &#x200b; *and why?! because i had the audacity, the gall, the absolute nerve, to be born with eyes that point forwa--* &#x200b; ***bang!!!*** &#x200b; a sudden impact cut my spiraling rant short as i struggled to keep my head inside my helmet. my ears were ringing slightly and i got a massive headache from the force of the hit. but what hurt most at that moment was my pride. the irony of smacking headfirst into something while ranting to yourself about your forward facing eyes, wasn't lost on me. &#x200b; *stupid venlil doorframes!* &#x200b; **memory transcription subject: teylim, yotul refugee sponsor date: \[standardized human time\] november 20, 2136** &#x200b; ***bang!!!*** &#x200b; ""ooooo a muffled groan of pain came from the other side of the front door. &#x200b; admittedly, the noise did make me jump for a moment because of how sudden it was. such a noise at this claw would normally be of considerable concern. under normal circumstances, i'd have grabbed tohba from his crib, locked myself in the basement, and called the local exterminators. however, these were not normal circumstances, and i've heard that exact banging noise far too many times not to recognize it. this was no late paw burglary or some native predator that had managed to sneak its way into town. no, it was just our resident spaceman michael being abruptly and harshly brought back to reality by the front doorframe...again. &#x200b; i suppressed a chuckle as my suspicions were confirmed. the door opened and a still very dazed human stumbled in, guitar still in hand, with the other on his head. the reflective helmet seemed to have gained a fresh new scratch to add to the collection. &#x200b; ""good paw, michael!"" &#x200b; the human unceremoniously took off his helmet and rubbed his forehead. ""heya tey..."" &#x200b; ""doorframe?"" &#x200b; ""doorframe."" &#x200b; ""bad night?"" &#x200b; ""always."" &#x200b; ""want tea?"" &#x200b; he let out a sigh. ""yes, please."" &#x200b; my good mood was brought down slightly by michael's retelling of events. honestly, the nerve of some beings. as if the humiliation of playing for almost no one every week wasn't enough, now they're deciding that poking and prodding at him like some kind of science experiment is a good idea. i hardly recognize this place since michael moved in. all the people i've come to know here have turned into frightened shells of their former selves. i of course don't blame michael for any of it. he can't help being who he is. it's this town, this planet, this galaxy that's programmed everyone in it to fear what they don't understand. &#x200b; **maybe it would be better if he hadn't come.** &#x200b; *no! i volunteered to sponsor a refugee because i wanted to help in whatever way i could! he deserves to be able to live here!* &#x200b; **the government stipend wasn't bad either.** &#x200b; *. . .that's not fair.* &#x200b; ""but anyways, dohk ended up settling things and cutting the prickly prick off. he says hi, by the way."" &#x200b; i broke myself free from my thoughts. ""well i'm glad things didn't escalate, and that you made it back safe."" &#x200b; michael sighed and continued nursing his headache. ""you know, you don't have to stay up to make sure i make it back."" &#x200b; *oh no you don't.* &#x200b; ""nonsense. i'm happy too. you know that the exterminators have been out in force at these late paws. ever since-"" &#x200b; ""i moved into town?"" he interrupted. &#x200b; i took a breath. ""ever since the extermination fleet over earth was destroyed."" &#x200b; ""it's not like we asked those child-eating monsters to help!"" &#x200b; i knew that detail of the battle was particularly grating for him. out of all the species to come to the humans aid, it just had to be the arxur. it was almost poetic in a way. it wasn't just that though. ""child-eating."" i felt the venom in michael's voice. he'd become quite fond of my son, tohba. seeing the two of them together was always the most adorable thing. it was another reason i loved having michael here. it was like having a second son who'd just returned home from university. i'm sure the thought of anything harming tohba terrified him. it certainly terrifies me. &#x200b; ""anyways. i'm gonna turn in for the paw. thanks for the tea, tey."" &#x200b; **he's still holding something back.** &#x200b; i started to get up after him. ""a-are you sure? you know if something else is bugging you, you can talk to-"" &#x200b; ""i know! i know... i know i can, tey. i'm just... really not in the mood right now. sorry."" &#x200b; **are you really just going to let him go and sulk?** &#x200b; *i won't force him. he'll talk to us when he's good and ready. all we can do for now is be there, just in case.* &#x200b; i gave a defeated sigh. ""alright. alright. i won't pry. just remember we're going to the markets next paw. i'm extremely interested in this whole thanks..giving thing you humans have."" &#x200b; *come on. smile you* *big angsty goof.* &#x200b; the sides of his lips raised slightly. *yes!* ""fine. mind if i bring my guitar along?"" &#x200b; i crossed my arms. ""it won't get you out of carrying the groceries."" &#x200b; he turned and gave me a dismissive wave of his hand. ""yeah yeah."" &#x200b; ""what was that?"" &#x200b; he called back to me before heading into his room. ""yes ma'am!"" &#x200b; i laughed slightly as i quickly cleaned the teacups and kettle before retiring to my room for the rest paw. i gave tohba an affectionate lick as i stopped at his crib, making sure to tuck him in a bit more snug. as i laid down i couldn't help but think about the past \[month\]. &#x200b; *michael has made great progress since that day. it was a miracle if he ever came out of his room. i know we still have a way to go before he's willing to completely open up, but i'm proud of how far he's come. i can't help but wonder if things could've been different... if it hadn't started out the way it did.* &#x200b; next",NatureofPredators,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/16e34ir/nature_of_a_homeless_musician_chapter_1_just/

16dywqh,"(long) my experience with daimons so far, a breakup, and how my spirit team help me reconnect with myself.","hello all, i'd like to share my experience with daimons so far. apologies if it's fragmented and reads weird. i just want to share my whole experience thus far, as i'm sure the couple friends i've been telling are tired of me lol. i have meditated all my life. i began rediscovering myself again relatively recently; leading me to rediscover my love for spirit/astral work, and the history of magic as a topic of research from my teenage years. i began reading tarot for a few months, then witchcraft for about 6 months, then spirit work. i was called to hekate and morrigan first, and started practicing witchcraft more as a spiritual practice (general connection with nature); then i began ancestor work. that all lead me to demonolatry, about a month and a half at this point. i think i have a pretty strong intuition that comes from my gut and i'd noticed that when i call out to spirits my right ear rings or the hearing becomes less? it's hard to explain. when i notice a strong presence i feel it behind my right ear and into the front of my neck and right shoulder. one day i was walking away from the beach, on the boardwalk. i'd been asking for help from spirit out loud. i audibly heard ""ok"" in my right ear. i have never turned around so fast in my life. i am a pretty skepitcal person, but that was the first time i'd ever experienced something like that. since then, i have remained hyper vigilant at whether or not any experience i am having is due to spiritual psychosis. which i think is a good way to go about it tbh. this happened *riiiiiight* before i discovered demonolatry. lilith called to me shortly after this. after some time meditating with lilith came the remainder of her sisters; lilith ultimately told me that they were there when my parents ""decided to stop being parents"" in one meditation/prayer session. a thought that i don't believe could have ever originated from my own thoughts. i had been researching all the goetic daimons, as one does. not sure where i read it, but i'd learned that king agares was a funny guy; which i appreciated. that night i dreamt of an old man with a crown riding a croc in a river, peeking out of some cattails. he was speaking through his croc, but it was detatched like the canadians from south park; hilarious. i was very excited. i'd never dreamt of any specific spirit/diety so far. so i drew his sigil on my window sill, as i had with everyone else so far. however i mistitled him as ""duke"" agares instead of king agares; important later, obviously. i made a pendulum and began working with that. i chose to work with my spirit team vs my own intuition for divination. i had done about 10 sessions previously; then in one particular session i felt something through my ear/neck. i began asking who all was with me: >i asked if the daimons were with me, they said yes; and they also confirmed they are always with me. >i asked if hekate and morrigan were with me, the answer to that is always no. >i asked if there was anything/anyone else with me, yes. >more than one? no. >one of my ancestors? yes. when i call out to my ancestors, i specifically say: ""my ancestors and ancestors to be"". so i also meant my ex's acestors as well, as i was so sure we were getting married. i have a specific necklace that i wore, where i stated that ancestors and spirits may find me if i was wearing it and for everyone to leave and give me privacy if i wasn't. something i practice a lot less now, lol. i had had an image of my bedroom door with a shadow in front of it, and when i acknowledged that in my mind the image would go black and the shadow would turn white but it's eyes red and it would scream without break; which i changed it's screaming to a funny noise as i felt i had a right to peace in my own mind... and it violated my rules with the necklace. so back to the pendulum divination. i confirmed that this presence was the late brother of my partner's grandfather. i got a full name, i got birth and death dates, and i got the reason he came to me. the reason being that i was to send him on his way after, specifically within 25 years. i asked if i was to invoke god, buddha, yhwh, etc. to do so. all no's. then who? i asked. he spelled out ""y o u"". crazy shit. i made it abundantly clear that what he was asking me to do would take a lot of research and a lot of time; when i asked if he was ok with that he said yes. okay! this is exciting, i thought. i'd better tell my ex, i thought. i should not have thought. it didn't go well; even though they were very supportive of my practices previously. we argued and as we are both autistic we decided we needed time to process; we broke up in this waiting time, and i am currently still waiting for them to message me. which is fine, i'm human, i'm allowed to hang on. i began to research more and i came across more about ***king*** agares. oh. shit. i go to correct the title next to the sigil. i apologize and all. i'd then asked if he'd done this, the break up, i mean. i whipped out the pendulum to ask more specific questions: >did you do this to teach me a lesson? yes. >i'm mad, is it ok that i'm mad about it? yes. >do you forgive me now? yes. >is it ok that i don't forgive you for some time? yes. >can you undo it? no. ultimately we had a conversation where king agares said that, even though you were doing the things that your partner was saying they wanted me to do/not doing things they wanted me to do, you would not have done them and fully committed to doing/not doing those things. so, next time, keep this in mind. fully commit, don't half ass. in later meditations with king agares, i forgave him and said ""maaaan, that was fucked up... but i admit that it was funny. fucked up, but funny."" the image of him, that came to me in the dream, came to me and he and his croc had a chuckle. eventually he said he, personally (i am aware some do care), doesn't *actually* care about the mistitling, he just wanted to frame the lesson in a way that i would understand. still, i'll always be careful to not mistitle anyone in the future. whenever i'm struggling in a moment, i make it a point to say that i don't doubt their methods and the necessity of the specific lesson; but i also acknowledge and express ""this sucks, why couldn't you guys teach me another way?"". i don't even remember exactly how king paimon came to me, as i was in the absolute despair part of the break up, but he did. as king paimon has very distinct and powerful energy, it's very obvious when he's with me and wants to speak with me. a couple more days after i invoked him, i felt him again. i pleaded ""please let me cry every tear i have for them"" and boy did i. king paimon wrung me out like a wet towel. a couple days later, while in the shower, i got the idea that i needed to mourn who i was in the relationship as well; i approached it with the intention to write a pseudo-spell/words of power for myself only. i got the general outline done in my head by the time i finished the shower and got back to my room to write it down. then i noticed his presence again. i ended up writing this, while bawling my eyes out, with king paimon's assitance: >let this rain fully extinguish the person i was before. although i have doubted a flame or spark ever existed within him; it is clear now within him was an uncontained wildfire. let him die, do not mourn him; he would not have mourned me. let this water that wash over me extinguish his wild and untamed flame. extinguish the flame of any that you have nurtured from when he passed the torch in our lowest, most sorrowful moment. yes, even my current flame. it is time to alight it anew. he threw the torch at me, lashing out in fear. do not catch it. let his flame die, let our flames die. listen to the sizzle of the flame being extinguished; listen to the last coals, the last embers, finally die out. feel the steam of our extinguished flames. >i ask for my new spark, my new fire to be pointed and focused. although i do not know what my intentions, my purpose, or my passions are now; i will nurture my spark and my flame so that it may burn brightly and with purpose. let me borrow holy or infernal flame, any flame, at first and for a time, because i am lost. >i am so lost. >so very lost. >lost in his destruction that is in every direction i look. >eventually, i will find myself. i know i will. >let my new flame cast away his shadows. he will resist, as they were his only friends; and they, too, will resist. let my new flame burn bright enough so that they cannot rise from the ashes. if they return, i will embrace them with love and kindness. we will embrace and they will burn away, back to the void whence they came. he will mourn them, but do not comfort him; it is not your pain to grieve. as he fizzles out; listen and acknowledge his pain. observe his boundless destruction. be with it for one last moment, hold his pain dear one last time, then return it to the ground you stand on. >he did not want this, i did not want this, we did not want this. >he was lost. >he was alone. >he was only a boy without help >he was only a boy without. >he was only a boy. >he was only a boy. >and he was alone. >when i am done contemplating his destruction, i will search for him. he will arise out of the ashes. i must let him know he is not alone now. he will be too weak to walk, so i will carry him. i will carry him for as long as it takes. he is mine and i am his. i am proud he survived. he is in awe that i could have made it this far. i remind him that he made it this far. >*we* made it this far. >when he has regained his strength, i will teach him to walk. i will take his hand, and we will walk a path together; any path. it may not be the path, but we will walk it together. >we will walk it together, and i will teach him everything he wishes. no matter how small or seemingly insignificant; i will nurture his every curiosity and wonder. so that i, too, will begin to wonder again. >our flames will reunite and be as one. >we may choose to blaze our own trail later, but now is not the time. now is the time to simply be with each other. >to know that we are not alone anymore. >we are not alone anymore. >we are not alone. >i am not alone. ^writing ^is ^also ^another ^thing ^i ^forgot ^i ^had ^an ^affinity ^for ^in ^my ^teenage ^years, ^lol. i shared this with a couple important people, so this may out me; but i don't care anymore lol. my mantra since the breakup has been: ""welp, i've got nothing else to lose man_shrugging "" king paimon taught me that it's also important to mourn *yourself* in regard to trauma and the version of yourself holding on to deeply ingrained/long-running negative habits; the subconscious defensive habits that prevent you from feeling the necessary feelings to *truly* do healing and processing. after this a friend reached out to me, and helped me by telling me to just behave as if my ex already said no to getting back together. she even took me to a volunteer for a concert, and we attended it because we got free tickets for doing so. it is now my belief that the best offerings i can give to my spirit team are the emotions that i am should be feeling in any given situation, and the actions i need to make toward my self improvement. *especially* concerning the lessons they want to teach me. experiencing everything this world has to offer, including the emotions - maybe even especially the emotions, *has* to be the ultimate lesson; at least it is for me, personally. i also believe that the ladies - *hekate, morrigan, lilith, aggereth, naamah, eisheth zenunim* - who came to me initially were teaching me to do so freely and confidently; as they all teach sovereignty. i had been very afraid to do anything or talk to anyone before. i still am, but much less so. so now, every now and then i feel compelled to express the appreciation and love i have for them and their presence in my life: >i love you all. >i love you king paimon. >i love you king agares. >i love you lilith. >i love you agrat bat mahlat. >i love you naamah. >i love you eisheth zenunim. >i love you king asmodeus. >i love you duchess bune. >i love you duke dantalion. >i love you president camio. and i say this before i go to bed more often than not. i'm sure the absoulte whirlwind of spiritual involvement will become less intense/frequent as time passes the events of the breakup; because i know how insane this probably looks, even to experienced practitioners. the breakup has not even been 2 weeks ago at this point. well, maybe it will maybe it won't. they help me to reconnect to and recontextualize my emotions, how to be my true self, how to shed everything that is not truly me (an important distinction to make, i think), and how to *really* be present. these are things i'd been struggling with; especially as i learned more about my brain - as an adult - in the ways of asd, adhd, and childhood trauma... which has gotta be so much harder than having known/been diagnosed since you were a kid, right? something about old dogs? **even though i still moments of weakness here and there; for the first time in my life, i don't dissociate everything away and i feel human.** idk why i felt compelled to write this, but thanks for reading. = if i could ask about your experiences, reader: * how do you experience the presence of the spirits you work with? * what sorts of things have you received help with? * have the spirits you work with tricked you; even though they're not *traditionally* known as ""tricksters""? edited to add a funny detail: lilith had warned me to not be so forthcoming with my practices to my ex, before king agares came to me, but i ignored the warning or didn't realize it was a warning to begin with.",DemonolatryPractices,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemonolatryPractices/comments/16dywqh/long_my_experience_with_daimons_so_far_a_breakup/

16e35uf,a naked body would be found tied and bound in the attic of a building. months later a japanese national would be killed in a similar manner prompting many to speculate that the cases are connected.,"(both of these cases are very violent and disturbing...which seems to be a theme with these hong kong cases i've found part of why it took me a while to write this was because i'm not as desensitized to cases as i had thought and because due to the nature of these cases, i spent a while trying to figure out how to remain tactful and not accidentally write something offensive and disrespectful. ) on june 6, 1975, a worker tasked with making reservations arrived at his job at the windsor building in tsim sha tsui, hong kong. once he entered the attic he quickly discovered the naked body of a woman and in a panic ran downstairs and informed the watchman of the building who in turn called the police and were led to the attic to begin investigations. the body belonged to a woman estimated to be around 20 years of age and was lying on her back. stuffed in her mouth was a piece of blue cloth with her ankles tied together by blue cloth and her wrists tied behind her back with a towel. there was a large wound on her abdomen and several wounds on her breasts caused by a sharp object. most horrifyingly was a wooden stick inserted into her genital region. police found a torn white bra and a pair of black trousers neatly placed next to the body, not far from the body, there was a torn and ripped pair of women's blue trousers which was likely where the restraints came from. in a gravel pile which was a part of the renovations, police found a brown handbag containing a zenith clothing factory card, a jade pendant, two bank passbooks with a total of 20,000 hong kong dollars, a penny, an umbrella, and a rice kettle. a medical examiner noted several bruises to her neck and that all the wounds and other forms of mutilation were post-mortem with the exception of the insertion of the wooden stick. on the wood surrounding the body, police found blood stains and urine on the wooden floor of the attic and her right hand clenched into a fist making the medical examiner believe that she had suffered some form of a shock before death. the cause of death was a single stab wound to the left side of her chest. the medical examiner placed her time of death as between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on june 5th. no semen was found anywhere near or on her body. police believed the killing to have a personal motive. while investigating a man named wong kuen-tse approached the police to report his wife missing. his wife was 25-year-old tam yuen-han and was employed as a labourer at a garment factory. while on duty an electrical fire had broken out at the factory and caused a power failure on that street. the factory was evacuated while firefighters extinguished the blaze and crews worked to restore power. once the fire was extinguished the factory did a headcount and saw that yuen-han was nowhere to be found. as no bodies were found in the building and it was evacuated without injury they all just assumed she went home early and thought nothing of it. the next day kuen-tse figured that when he woke up to see her not around she simply went back to work and only called the police after being told she wasn't there. keun-tse positively identified the body. he told the police that yuen-han had two ex-boyfriends prior to him and that before they got married he had received several threatening phone calls from an unknown man warning him not to ""take my love away from me"". in spite of these threats, the two got married and unsurprisingly the threats still continued. the police's main suspect was this mystery caller so they questioned yuen-han's family about her prior romantic partners. one of the two was very close and assumed they would get married so he was not happy when yuen-han had to move away which in turn ended the relationship. the couple also received several other phone calls from former boyfriends who instead of threatening them were rather begging and pleading for her to take them back. the police reasoned that one of the callers killed yuen-han in a crime of passion and began efforts to track down and identify them. the police searched through phone call records and tracked down all 4 of the former boyfriends. the one who made the most threatening was a man named tong lam. lam lied to the police about his feelings and claimed that he lost interest after yuen-han got married. his alibi is that he was in macau doing business with his goldsmith boss. the macanese authorities confirmed this alibi leaving the hong kong police with no more suspects. in 1976 the police issued a reward of 10,000 hong kong dollars for anyone with information. years later the police then remembered another case which happened after yuen-han's murder and wondered if they were connected. on september 2, 1975, a japanese national and engineer worked at the desalination plant of hong kong's castle peak lok arrangement (cpla). he arrived home to find that his wife 27-year-old keiko inari wasn't waiting for him at the front gate. he could still hear the sound of his baby daughter crying from outside which made him nervous. upon entering the house he found the lights were already on. he heard the sounds of his baby crying and headed towards the room turning on the lights which is when he found keiko's body. on the floor was a blood trail which led to keiko's body lying down on her back on the floor. her hands and feet were spread out in a ""zigzag pattern"" and was only wearing her shirt with nothing underneath with her breasts and lower body bloodied. the police arrived to begin their investigation. the cause of death was evident as the police found a green scarf wrapped around her neck causing strangulation to be listed as the cause of death and lying next to keiko's body was her underwear. after examining the room the police observed that there were two coins on the carpet at the entrance, two pillows on the floor of the hall which were originally from the bedroom, and several books had fallen from the bookshelf indicating that a fight and struggle had taken place. although the cause of death was strangulation, keiko had been attacked prior to that due to how bloodied she was. in spite of this, no weapons were found at the scene and the only thing that was a japanese language newspaper the couple had delivered at 9:00 a.m. every morning. the police reasoned that the killer likely wrapped the bloody weapon in this newspaper to sneak it out of the home unnoticed. the police then searched the entire room and found that three watches worth 3,000 hong kong dollars were missing. these items were likely stolen in order to stage the crime as a robbery. a pathologist called to the scene ruled that the wounds to her body were likely inflicted by a surgical scalpel. there were 21 wounds on the left breast and 18 on the right with the deepest wound being 4 inches. both of her nipples were also cut with the cuts being in the shape of a cross. the wounds to her lower body were also focused and centred on her genitals with one from her genital region and cut down to her anus. the killer had also shaved pubic hair after death before cutting her genital area several times with 30 wounds. no semen was found on her body and the wounds were believed to be inflicted post-mortem. the cause of death was listed as strangulation which likely happened at 3:00 p.m. that same day. based on the brutality the killer was reasoned to be a sadist and likely knew keiko. that had the potential to narrow down the suspect list considerably. keiko had been living in hong kong for a year and couldn't speak cantonese or understand others when they spoke it. keiko also couldn't speak any english which meant that any conversations she held would be in japanese which also meant that the only way someone could actually truly know her would be if they spoke or understood japanese. the area she and her husband lived in was mei foo sun chuen and it was chosen due to the proximity to her workplace and a large number of japanese expats and that the killer at least to the police was likely one of them. the police questioned other residents of the apartment and a maid told the police that at 2:00 p.m. she heard a loud argument between a man and a woman. as the argument was in japanese she couldn't understand what it was about and didn't report it. at least she thought, she couldn't verify that it was in japanese just that it wasn't english or cantonese. the man she was arguing with was named itoda (not his real name). itoda was from tokyo and worked at a local department store. itoda and his wife lived in the same apartment block and knew keiko and her husband. itoda was known to be a sex fiend (no mentions of if he had a criminal record for sex crimes) and inside his home numerous hardcore and abusive pornography and erotic magazines. itoda was also known to be a frequent client for prostitutes in hong kong. ten days before the murder itoda's wife returned to tokyo leaving him alone which is why investigators thought he may be guilty. after obtaining a warrant they searched his home where they found all the pornography mentioned above with some of the tapes even being recordings of itoda and his wife having sex. itoda was arrested and interrogated by officers who knew japanese and even attempted to coerce him into a confession. itoda denied any involvement and soon requested help from the japanese consulate with itoda later being released due to a lack of anything tying him to the crime. police issued notices to all pawn shops in hong kong and macau with pictures of keiko's stolen property and told them to be on the lookout for anyone bringing those items in. the case became a sensation in both hong kong and japan with it being reported for days and the japanese consulate putting pressure on the hong kong police and aiding them in the investigation. not long after keiko's husband left hong kong and returned to japan with his daughter. itoda's reputation was tarnished due to the whole case and soon left hong kong and moved to mainland china where he married a local chinese woman and opened his own business there after divorcing his wife. keiko's murder went unsolved until as mentioned above police, years later, began to look at both keiki inari and tam yuen-han's murders as possibly being connected due to a similar m.o. police also believed that the killer may actually be a woman and that she had accomplices worked with her. even with the possible connection, both murders remain unsolved. ***sources*** [*** [***

16dzauj,tifu by using my mom's wipes,"idk if this is relevant but it's my first time posting :| and also i'm a malefe (female). potential trigger: slightly talks about my butt, so leave if it bothers you lol i view this more of a silly story even though when this took place, i was in agony. so today i was getting dressed for an occasion. it was around 6am, i was taking a shower and etc.. for some basic information, i live with my mom and dad. i saw some wipes on the sink in the bathroom and decided to bring that to my room. they weren't my wipes, they were my mom's, which is already my first fuck up. normally i steal her shit because i either get curious or i get lazy lol. so of course, it had pink packaging (like most female products do), it looked all gorgeous and pretty, and even the label said ""pink grapefruit"" as the scent. for some reason my stupid ass decided to tell myself to use the wipes to wipe myself ""down there"", which is only half impulsive. when i say this is one of the most stupid decisions and choices i've ever made in my life, it definitely comes in top 5 (saying a lot). i was thinking my areas were gonna smell like ""pink grapefruit"" just out of curiosity (i really wanted to know lmfao). i wiped myself in my sensitive areas and essentially almost yelled at the sharp pain coming from my ass. out of all places i chose that place to start first, i now felt so much regret. i still continued to wipe elsewhere because i thought the pain was normal. like as if it was medicine except it's not medicine. if i wasn't already awake then i definitely was at that point. i felt another wave of an even sharper pain in between my legs. i eventually looked at the packaging and it says in tiny print ""acne prone skin wipes"" and my eyes became wide open and my heart legitimately sinks down into my socks. first of all, this is in the smallest font in the world, like what the fuck? i have 20/20 vision and i deadass felt like i was going blind just trying to read that (over exaggerating). several minutes pass by and i'm thinking to myself at this point like ""am i going to be okay?"". i had spent at least the past 30 minutes still inside the damn bathroom. i decided to call my mother, and yes i disturbed her out of her sleep to talk about my ass feeling like a blown up propane tank for other reasons being not shitting. i was borderline crying when i call her. let me tell you that i got absolutely 0 advice on how to fix my burning asshole. my mom started to tell me off and she was just absolutely livid at the fact i was touching her stuff which is reasonable so i accepted the sleepy yelling from her. she also said something along the lines of ""this is why i don't keep my stuff in the bathroom"". yeah, essentially it is my fault that i was lit on fire like santa claus falling through a chimney and into a fireplace. but i seriously don't know what i was expecting from that interaction, i just needed to let someone know so i really ended up being mad at myself. another hour passed by and i was at the location and could barely walk with the wildfire around and what felt like what was in my pants. every time i had to get up and walk i felt self conscious because of the burning. plus what didn't help was that it was actually hilariously hot and humid outside. when i was called up at the event i was at, i walked weird and sideways and i totally got some stares of confusion. the amount of embarrassment that i had caused upon my own self was immaculate. i was so uncomfortable and sweaty with just straight up anxiety lmao. i think i also tripped over my own foot in front of everyone, but that definitely is because of clumsiness. but the entire social aspect was most likely in my head because social anxiety exists. so at this moment, everyone was probably thinking about something else and not me. the burning stopped after two hours and just damn did it feel like four. in all honesty, i will never ever use my mom's shit again, that is a lesson learned. i probably wouldn't use anyone's stuff but my own. &#x200b; tl;dr: i used my mom's wipes ""down there"" thinking it was ordinary wipes. it ended up being acne prone skin wipes and i didn't see it because it was written in tiny print. mom got mad. i ended up being a sad sad person. the event i went to felt so uncomfortable. de end.",tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/16dzauj/tifu_by_using_my_moms_wipes/

16f5s6w,breaking bad is an insane power fantasy and should have ended on granite state,"it initially mirrors american beauty with the whole lobotomite suburban dad who reclaims his vitality through controversial means, but instead of just smoking weed, jacking off to 17 year olds and calling your daughter a bitch. he nearly singlehandedly ousts his state’s biggest drug kingpin, makes the purest meth ever seen by mankind and becomes so successful that there’s a scene where his wife outright states that he no longer has financial incentive to produce meth because he’s made so much money that he could never feasibly run out of it. then ozymandias happens, everything comes crashing down, and just as you think we’re finally going to get emotional payoff and a conclusion to walter’s arc where he suffers the consequences of everything he’s done and will die, sad, alone and in pain, he’s just like, “fuck it nvm” and travels across country while there’s a national manhunt for him, is identified by several people which does not deter him at any point and then goes on an unstoppable killing spree which defeats all of his remaining enemies which also fixes all of the problems his friends and family were suffering as a result of his egomaniacal criminal reign falling and they all get to go live decent lives now. it’s ridiculous and insane and ruins the entire series, which already wasn’t very good. the series could have very much ended on a slightly altered version of the penultimate episode granite state, which sure, would have been a little anti-climactic but at least has some meaning to it? despite being an autistic nerd walter white feels like he was written for the specific purpose of inspiring as many chad memes and sigma edits as possible, what a ridiculous character.",redscarepod,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/16f5s6w/breaking_bad_is_an_insane_power_fantasy_and/
