16dmb1o,denim on the diamond - refunds?,"first off, as someone that was evacuated due to the wildfires i understand that it was a fluid, scary situation. dotd decided to postpone the concert to thanksgiving long weekend, they have also switched tickets for individual day holders (original saturday ticket is not a friday ticket etc.). given that the dates have materially changed to a date that a lot of people will not be able to attend for various reasons (most common is family thanksgiving) i was wondering if anyone has had any luck with deadline with thick’s as thieves entertainment. they have suggested we donate the tickets or sell on marketplace. for many that were directly impacted by the fires, or have given elsewhere this does not make sense financially. for selling on marketplace , this has not been successful for most as dotd as reopened ticket sales as a direct competitor. they have also “updated” their policy on their site to state that refunds will not be provided should the event be postponed. this was not there before the wildfires. has anyone had any success with getting their tickets refunded? tldr: denim on the diamond / thick as thieves postponed their festival due to wildfires to thanksgiving long weekend when many cannot attend and has not offered refunds.",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/16dmb1o/denim_on_the_diamond_refunds/,1

160g16o,to the idiot who tied his very large dogs directly in front of the entrance at circle k,"what were you thinking? use your head! i know this post likely won't reach the intended person but still, i feel the need to vent my frustration with yet another example of people's unhinged stupidity and ignorance these days. tying your dogs immediately in front of the door is bad because: 1. blocking a fire exit 2. someone could get attacked if the dogs get spooked or accidentally stepped on, or they aren't friendly dogs 3. irresponsible ownership of animals. either don't bring them, have a trusted person watch them while your in the store, or if you absolutely must bring them, tie them up out of the way where they'll be more relaxed and not likely to cause an incident. 4. there's likely other issues with this whole scenario that aren't coming across my mind at this exact moment. 5. edit: some stores are actually dog friendly and will let you bring them in, provided they're on a leash and not making any mess. never hurts to try asking the employee(s). use your frickin' brain! end of rant... for now",kelowna,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/160g16o/to_the_idiot_who_tied_his_very_large_dogs/,0
