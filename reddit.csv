It'd keep Aiz and tiona happy and having someone who is a level 4 with the status of a advanced level 5 would be a great addition to their Familia. Having him be under Ouranos would spell disaster with the public image. They'd accuse the guild of favoritism which would remove the trust they have in the ""neutral"" party.

Hermes would talk about them and begin to lead Bell into finding information about Zeus and Hera. The stories of Zard and Alfia would be covered as Bell would speak with Hermes, Ottarl, Ryu, and Finn trying to learn more about the Evilus that Jura had been a part of and that Zard and Alfia had aligned with for their own reasons. Bell would learn about Astrea and Alfia and Hermes would perhaps tell him about the private conversation between Alfia and Erebus at the end of Astrea Record.

reddit_comments,BBG000BZX1N5,1609493479,Sambidiah,The problem with this is if Loki and Freya go to war Orario will not have enough power to beat the OEBD unless Bell goes full protagonists mode and then some. Also Freya wouldn’t risk sending hestia back while bell is in the dungeon. That would be way too risky even for Freya she doesn’t want to take that chance with bell dying. The other reason why Bell and Aiz will probably never be in the same Familia is because it would make Sword Oratoria not needed. The main cast should all be safe from dying but Bell is probably gonna get his ass kicked a lot in the upcoming volumes. I’d love to see them in the same Familia so they can interact more but it’s highly unlikely.

reddit_comments,BBG000BZX1N5,1609485250,Verzwei,"I usually like Haag, and I don't think she disappointed here. She's got a good sound for the schemer archetype that fits her early characterization.

I hard disagree on Welf. I actually like him a lot. He's got this kinda cocky sound but then also sounds like the team dad at the same time and I really like it. And, coincidentally, it's his interactions with Haag's Lily that I like the best.

I never took Aiz as a kuudere... Or, at least, not the ""dere"" part. She's just very stoic and aloof and barely shows interest in anything. There's a different Sentai actress who I might have liked _more_ as Aiz, but I don't have any problems with the one we got.

As for Wiene, I've got no comment. Thus far, I've only watched the first main season, the first OVA, the Sword Oratoria spin-off, the Arrow film, and 10 episodes of Season 2, so I haven't encountered her yet. Some light googling suggests I'll experience her soon, if I find her appalling then maybe I'll make a small update.

Mikoto might be the only one I come _close_ to agreeing with you. I'd not go so far as to say dreadful, but her phrasing is definitely, uh, distinct. My _assumption_, since the character is a samurai/ninja in what is otherwise a more medieval-style fantasy setting, is that Mikoto's original Japanese delivery is very direct, formal, and potentially antiquated, and it can be kind of hard to do the same thing in English when our language doesn't have such clear delineations between formal and casual speak. I notice that English Mikoto sounds better in the calm moments where she's just hanging out with the other cast. It's when she's in ""serious battle mode"" that it's easiest to critique. Since the series features so few ""east Asian"" characters, it might have even been a better solution to take a Princess Principal route and give her a Japanese accent rather than having her speak stiff American English. It would have gotten the ""difference"" in her speech (compared against the other cast) across but maybe allowed for better wordflow in the process.

Edit, 3 days later, so it's unlikely this will be seen, but I watched the rest of season 2 and the first episode of season 3. Based on what RQA said, I was expecting Wiene to be super-shrill or annoying or something, but she was totally fine. She just speaks in fragments (because she barely knows language) but I didn't find the voice off-putting or grating at all.",1.0,0.0,anime,4594394,,
reddit_comments,BBG000BZX1N5,1609511717,Andi_Apocrypha,"Of course Bell is Bell so I expect that he will want to help Xenos even as a member of Loki familia. What I wanted to point out here is that he will have no allies in this at all in his own familia. The biggest issue is Finn. He is Loki first child and he joined her under conditions that he will have her **full support** with his goals and we know that Finn in the beginning noticed really quickly that Xenos are different and could talk to humans and he still decided to kill them cuz if this info got spread wide then everything would become haotic and if not that, the fact that Braver would assiociate with monsters could ruin everything he did so far to spread his name as a light for pallums. And Loki would be on Finn side here, not Bell's. Maybe reluctantly a little bit but Finn would be far more important to her I think not even counting the contract she made with him when he joined her familia.

If you think about that, who of Loki familia would stay on Bell side in all of this? I can only think that Tiona wouldn't like killing monsters that have feelings and Lefiya probably too cuz in the end she is very similar to Bell and would probably arrive to the same conclusion as him. Other than those two? Most of them would choose to follow Finn orders with Aiz and Bete especially hating monsters and Tione being in love with Finn would never betray him.

So that was the issue I wanted to bring and I want to point out that the most problems would be in this arc",3.0,0.0,DanMachi,5303485,,

## Post Reveal Thoughts

I visited the Westland distillery with /u/random_guy7531 a little while back.  Really cool looking tasting room, but they committed the cardinal sin of putting your tasting room in the same building/area as the brewing vats and stills.  It smelled so incredibly strongly of malt that you could not really nose the whisky.  Still a fun tasting, but they need to at least get some better ventilation there.

I will give Westland credit, for only producing 3 year old malt, this is pretty decent.  However, with the amount they charge for it, it had better be.  Now that they are owned by Remy, I'm hoping they have a more stable cash flow to purse older releases.

  I have a YouTube dharma playlist with over a 100 videos here:   
  [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAO3yQ09SRtGOAAdC89Xt7lDNzXYgAJQ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAO3yQ09SRtGOAAdC89Xt7lDNzXYgAJQ)   
    
    
  Some of my favorite books myself and ones I recommend are:     
    
  *Joy of Living* by Mingyur Rinpoche. These type of books on how to live a happier life are good even if you're not so keen on Buddhism.    

  
  *Buddhism for Dummies* by Jonathan Landaw. I don't like the title much, am I a dummy? Maybe in some things and not others. Still, a book like this is excellent because it provides an overview of nearly everything in Buddhism. An excellent foundation.     
    
   *Introducing Buddha: A Graphic Guide* by Jane Hope &amp; Borin Van Loon. I like the Graphic Guide series quite a bit as they’re fun to read and provide a great start and overview. Buddhists are often comparatively quite uninformed of the Buddha’s life and teachings compared to other religions (such as Christianity). If you read *Buddhism for Dummies, Introducing Buddha: A Graphic Guide,* and *What the Buddha Taught* this won’t be you.     
    
  *What the Buddha Taught* by Walpola Rahula. A classic and good expose of the doctrine the Buddha taught.     
    
  *Why Buddhism is True* by Robert Wright  *Why Buddhism is True* by Robert Wright pairs up quite nicely with *What the Buddha Taught,* as *Why Buddhism is True* eschews entirely the doctrinaire aspect of Buddhism in favor of Buddhism’s science of the mind. The pair of    books make a nice combo.       
    
  and for Meditation, *Don't Look Down on the Defilements, They'll Laugh At You* by U Tejaniya. You can download his books for free from his website, [https://ashintejaniya.org/](https://ashintejaniya.org/)   
    
  Jack Kornfield's *The Buddha is Still Teaching* has many short excerpts from various books and masters. It makes a nice book to pick up and read for short snippets. It's also good in that you can find other authors and writers you might enjoy reading.     
    
  Kornfield's *Path With a Heart* is a favorite and wonderfully kind book I've read a couple times.     
    
   A very readable book reportedly written by the Buddha is *The Dhammapada.* It's full of wise sayings you've probably seen on Internet memes. I recommend the Gil Fronsdal translation version of *The Dhammapada*.    
   If you like *The Dhammapada,* continue down the early Buddhism path with Gil Fronsdal book, *The Buddha Before Buddhism: Wisdom from the Early Teachings.*     
     
   Some top online options I want to draw your attention to are below.     Coursera. I recommend Robert Wright's *Modern Psychology and Buddhism* course. Free.    [https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation)   


Tibet House, Delhi. Under Geshe Dorje Damdul. I've known several people who've taken this program and they rave about it. There's a cost, but it's Indian pricing so it's very reasonable.    [https://tibethouse.in](https://tibet/)   


(Not Buddhism, but still good). Modernstoicism.com. Home of Stoicism week and Free Courses [https://learn.modernstoicism.com/](https://learn.modernstoicism.com/)   


  If you can afford it, subscribe to the *Waking Up* app (currently $99 a year). If you can't afford it, they seem very nice and easy regarding free accounts. Email them. The app is impressive and has a lot of excellent content.

He used to get shy and flustered easily, especially when asked to do aegyo or show off his charms (which I found endearing). But nowadays he have no problem doing so and is visibly much more confident! Which is very refreshing to see. I also love how Soobin, despite being an idol, feels just like an ordinary person trying to do his best in life. He is so natural and just lovable, he is the idol whom I finds most relatable. And it's so interesting and comforting to watch him talk :). He may not be a very interesting person or wild person, but he radiates this charm that makes him so comfortable and easy to look at, he is really our home \\^\\^ 숩

My bias is Taehyun and Beomgyu, while there is a lot to talk about Taehyun I also agree that Beomgyu is kind of mysterious hahah. But I get that he's a very sentimental person and I feel like ever since CYSM ended, he have changed a lot in a way that he's much more reserved and quiet nowadays.

They obviously don't have any alterior motive now do they they r obviously saints who will report the truth withough distorting facts to suit their narrative I mean it's not like hussinas govt is an authoritarian one and India's has spread false propoganda against Pakistan for decades going so far as to creating fake media cells and ressurecting the dead while also plagiarising material to spread their false narrative which was busted by the BBC and the EU disinfo lab. 

You truly are a fool. So by stating that most insurgents are coming from Pakistan traversing a fully fenced border with about 10 meters of no man's land between both being 40 meter high barbed wire  fences you have proven that either the Indian army is either incompetent or you are a liar. Now both have a very high chance of being true but the most likely one is the latter. You just showed Ur hypocrisy, MATLAB u say the mukhti bhainin were freedom fighters so by Ur logic the Kashmiris who have the same narrative and r doing the samething minuse the rapes and murders of civilians should also be freedom fighters but no, why coz India claim that it is 'their' land. You also probably believe the Indian army did surgical strikes in Pakistan as well in 2016 with Ur levels of naivatie don't you, with their source being, trust me bro. That is sad mate.

Btw read the book mentioned in the articles I am sending a link of it is by an Oxford academic who is a bangali. It is the most reliable source their is where her views r based on facts and not propoganda. It show what actually happened.

In all seriousness, the best thing I've found is to get those small circular colored stickers that people often use to put prices on things at garage sales.  I use those and just write what film is in the camera and attach it to the bottom plate of the camera.  They're sticky enough to not fall off, but wont damage the camera leaving any residue behind.

Unless, of course, your league has that 1 guy who thinks 2021 has a generational guy predicted to go early like Luck/Saquon/AJG. I do agree it would take more than Gallup + 1.08, though. 

I think a realistic shot is a low end WR1 + 2nd, or WR2 (Cooper, Evans, JuJu, etc.) + late 1st. Mainly because everyone wants multiple 1sts for their established WR1’s &amp; they’d be risking giving up that player for a young stud who may never return a Top 24.",4.0,0.0,DynastyFF,4788508,,
